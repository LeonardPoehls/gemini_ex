 ﻿
 General
 ﻿
 Guaranty Bancorp (the “Company”) is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”) and headquartered in Colorado. The Company’s principal business is to serve as a holding company for our bank subsidiary, Guaranty Bank and Trust Company, referred to as “Guaranty Bank” or “Bank”.
 ﻿
 References to the “Company”, “us”, “we” and “our” refer to Guaranty Bancorp on a consolidated basis. References to “Guaranty Bancorp” or to the “holding company” refer to the parent company on a stand-alone basis.
 ﻿
 At December 31, 2017, we had total assets of $3.7 billion, net loans of $2.8 billion, deposits of $2.9 billion and stockholders’ equity of $404.9 million, and we operated 33 branches and one investment management firm in Colorado through our bank subsidiary, Guaranty Bank.
 ﻿
 Guaranty Bancorp was incorporated in 2004 in the state of Delaware under the name Centennial C Corp., and in 2004 and 2005 acquired several banking institutions and other entities, including the Bank. By 2008, all of the entities acquired were ultimately merged into either Guaranty Bancorp or the Bank or divested.
 ﻿
 The Bank is the sole member of several limited liability companies that hold real estate and the sole owner of an investment management firm, Private Capital Management LLC (“PCM”).
 ﻿
 In 2012, Guaranty Bank purchased substantially all of the assets of Private Capital Management Inc., a Denver-based firm providing investment management and financial planning services to wealthy individuals since 1994.    ﻿
 In 2014, Guaranty Bank purchased substantially all of the assets of Cherry Hills Investment Advisors LLC (“CHIA”), a Greenwood Village-based firm providing investment management and financial planning services to individuals and families since 2009. On April 3, 2017, CHIA was consolidated into PCM.
 ﻿
 On September 8, 2016, the Company purchased Home State Bancorp (“Home State”), the parent company of Home State Bank, a Colorado state chartered bank headquartered in Loveland, Colorado, and merged Home State into the Company. 
 ﻿
 On July 18, 2017, the Company entered into a merger agreement with Castle Rock Bank Holding Company (“Castle Rock”), parent company of Castle Rock Bank, a Colorado state chartered bank headquartered in Castle Rock, Colorado. On October 27, 2017 the transaction closed and Castle Rock was merged into the Company. Substantially all integration activities were completed by December 31, 2017.
 ﻿
 On December 1, 2017, PCM entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Wagner Wealth Management LLC. The transaction closed on January 16, 2018.
 ﻿
 As a result of these recent acquisitions, the Company increased its market share in Colorado Front Range markets and gained the ability to provide customers with additional conveniences, including an expanded branch and ATM network.    ﻿
 Business 
 ﻿
 The Bank provides comprehensive banking and other financial services including commercial and industrial, real estate, construction and consumer loans throughout its targeted Colorado markets to consumers and small to medium-sized businesses, including the owners and employees of those businesses. In addition to loans and 

 
4


 

depository services, the Bank also provides wealth management solutions, including trust and investment management services. Substantially all loans are secured by specific items of collateral, including business assets, consumer assets and commercial and residential real estate. Commercial loans are expected to be repaid from cash flow from business operations. There are no significant concentrations of loans to any one industry or borrower. The borrowers’ ability to repay their loans is generally dependent on the real estate market and general economic conditions prevailing in Colorado, among other factors.
 ﻿
 We concentrate our lending activities in the following principal areas:
 ﻿
 Commercial Loans: Our commercial and industrial loan portfolio is comprised of operating loans secured by business assets. The portfolio is not concentrated in any particular industry. We classify loans by the borrowers’ intended purpose for the loan rather than the underlying collateral. Therefore, we include loans within this portfolio that are collateralized with various assets, including real estate. Repayment of secured commercial and industrial loans depends substantially on the borrower’s underlying business, financial condition and cash flows, as well as the sufficiency of the collateral. Compared to real estate, the collateral securing these loans may be more difficult to monitor, evaluate and sell. Economic conditions can significantly affect such risks.
 ﻿
 Commercial and Residential Real Estate Loans: This portfolio is mostly comprised of loans secured by commercial and residential real estate. The commercial real estate portfolio generally consists of owner-occupied, retail, industrial, office and multi-family properties. Commercial real estate and multi-family loans typically involve one or more loans to a single sponsor or groups of related sponsors. Since payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties securing the loans, as well as the business and financial condition of the borrower, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market, adverse economic conditions or changes in applicable government regulations. If the borrower is unable to obtain or renew leases for the underlying premises, causing a decline in cash flow from the property, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Residential real estate is comprised of residential mortgages, primarily jumbo mortgages and home equity lines of credit to customers in our markets. Home equity lines of credit are underwritten in a manner such that they result in credit risk that is substantially similar to that of residential mortgage loans. Nevertheless, home equity lines have greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans because they can be secured by mortgages that are subordinated to the existing first mortgage on the property, which we may or may not hold, and they are not covered by private mortgage insurance.
 ﻿
 Construction Loans: Our construction loan portfolio is comprised of investor-developer and owner-occupied properties and single-family residential development properties. Investor-developer properties include loans for the construction of commercial buildings, which are primarily income-producing properties. The repayment of construction loans is dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the construction of the subject property, which may additionally include achievement of stabilized occupancy, as well as the sale of the property to a third party or the availability of permanent financing upon completion of all improvements. Construction loans expose us to the risk that improvements will not be completed on time and in accordance with specifications and projected costs. Construction delays, the financial impairment of the builder, interest rate increases or economic downturn may further impair the borrower’s ability to repay the loan. In addition, the ultimate sale or rental of the property may not occur as anticipated.
 ﻿
 Installment Loans to Individuals and Other Consumer Loans: This category includes miscellaneous consumer loans including overdraft protection, lines of credit and other consumer loans. Consumer loans may be unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency may not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continued financial stability, which can be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that we can recover on such loans.    ﻿
 Small Business Administration Loans: Our Small Business Administration (“SBA”) portfolio consists of SBA guaranteed and other SBA-related loans. The guaranteed loans are for qualifying business purposes with maturity dates up to 25 years. The SBA guarantees up to 90% of the financing for these types of loans. The SBA-related loans are originated in partnership with the SBA under the SBA’s 504 loan program primarily on owner-occupied commercial real estate.

In addition, we provide traditional deposit accounts such as demand, interest-bearing demand, NOW, money market, IRA, time deposits and savings accounts. Our certificate of deposit customers primarily represent local relationships. Our branch network enables us to offer a full range of deposits, loans and personalized services to our targeted commercial and consumer customers.
 ﻿
 For financial information about our operations, see the section captioned “Results of Operations” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which are located elsewhere in this report.
 ﻿
 Our Philosophy and Strategy
 ﻿
 Our philosophy is to provide relationship banking; offering a broad array of personalized financial products with highly responsive and exceptional customer service. We are a community bank that serves Colorado by providing sound financial solutions to customers through experienced, engaged and empowered employees. Our vision statement expands on this by stating that we want to be recognized as a trusted financial partner where customers experience exceptional service, employees are proud to work, stockholders value their investment and our communities prosper.
 ﻿
 Our strategy to build a profitable, community-banking franchise along the Colorado Front Range spanning from Castle Rock to Fort Collins has not changed over the past several years. The strategy for serving our target markets is the delivery of a finely-focused set of value-added products and services that satisfy the primary needs of our customers, emphasizing superior service and relationships as opposed to transaction volume or low pricing. As a locally managed banking institution, we believe we are able to react more quickly to customers’ needs and provide a superior level of customer service compared to larger regional and super-regional banks. 
 ﻿
 Our Principal Markets 
 ﻿
 As of the date of this filing, we operate 32 branches located throughout Colorado’s Front Range, including the Denver metropolitan area, and one investment management firm. The region includes the counties of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Denver, Douglas, Jefferson, Larimer and Weld. Colorado’s Front Range has a regional economy that is a diverse mix of advanced technology, tourism, manufacturing, service firms, government, education, retail, small business, construction and agriculture.
 ﻿
 Business Concentrations 
 ﻿
 Management does not consider any individual account or single group of related accounts material in relation to our total assets or in relation to the overall business of the Company. Approximately 74% of our loan portfolio held for investment at December 31, 2017 consisted of real estate-related loans, including construction loans, mini-perm loans, commercial owner-occupied real estate loans and jumbo mortgage loans. Geographically, our business activities are primarily focused in the Colorado Front Range. Consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows depend upon the general trends in the economy of the Colorado Front Range and, in particular, the commercial and residential real estate markets.
 ﻿
 Competition 
 ﻿
 The banking business in Colorado is highly competitive. The market is characterized by a number of large financial institutions each with a large number of offices, and numerous small to medium-sized community banks and credit unions. In addition, non-bank entities in both the public and private sectors seeking to raise capital through the issuance and sale of debt or equity securities also provide competition for us in the acquisition of deposits. We also compete with brokerage firms, investment advisors, money market funds and issuers of other money market instruments. In recent years, increased competition has also developed from specialized finance and non-finance companies, some of which are not subject to the same regulatory requirements to which we are subject, that offer wholesale finance, credit card and other consumer finance services, including online banking services and personal finance software. Additionally, we expect competition to intensify among financial services companies due to mergers and acquisition of institutions within our market area by other competing, out-of-state financial institutions. Competition for deposit and loan products remains strong from both banking and non-banking firms and this competition directly affects the rates and the terms that we must offer on our products to remain competitive in the marketplace. In order to compete in our primary service area, we utilize to the fullest extent possible the 

 
6


 

flexibility that our community bank status permits, including providing an emphasis on specialized services, local promotional activity and personal contacts.
 ﻿
 Technological innovation continues to increase competition in the financial services markets. For example, technology has made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services previously limited to those offered as traditional banking products. In addition, customers now expect a choice of several delivery systems and channels, including telephone, mail, online, automated teller machines (ATMs), debit cards, point-of-sale transactions, automated clearing house transactions (ACH), remote deposit, banking via mobile devices, person-to-person (P2P) payments and in-store branches.
 ﻿
 Consolidation in the financial services industry and the resulting economies of scale, as well as increasing costs associated with regulatory compliance, have placed additional pressure on banks to consolidate their operations, reduce expenses and increase revenues to remain competitive. In addition, competition has intensified due to federal and state interstate banking laws, which permit banking organizations to expand geographically with fewer restrictions than in the past. These laws allow out-of-state banks to establish or expand banking operations in our market. The competitive environment is also significantly impacted by federal and state legislation that makes it easier for non-bank financial institutions to compete with us.
 ﻿
 Economic factors, along with legislative and technological changes, continue to impact the competitive environment within the financial services industry. As the Company is an active participant in financial markets, we strive to anticipate and adapt to dynamic competitive conditions, but we cannot provide assurance as to the impact of such changes on our future business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows nor can we provide assurances as to our ability to continue to anticipate and adapt to changing conditions.
 ﻿
 Supervision and Regulation 
 ﻿
 General 
 ﻿
 Banking is a complex, highly regulated industry. Consequently, the performance of the Company and the Bank can be affected not only by management decisions and general and local economic conditions, but also by the statutes enacted by, and the regulations and policies of, various governmental regulatory authorities. These authorities include, but are not limited to, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), the Colorado Division of Banking (the “CDB”), the Internal Revenue Service, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) and state taxing authorities. The effect of these statutes, regulations and policies and any changes to any of them can be significant and cannot be predicted.
 ﻿
 The primary goals of the bank regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system and to facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy. In furtherance of these goals, the U.S. Congress and the State of Colorado have created several largely autonomous regulatory agencies that oversee, and have enacted numerous laws that govern banks, bank holding companies and the banking industry. The system of supervision and regulation applicable to the Company and the Bank establishes a comprehensive framework for the entities’ respective operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the Bank’s depositors and the public, rather than the stockholders and creditors. The following summarizes some of the materially relevant laws, rules and regulations governing banks and bank holding companies, including the Company and the Bank, but does not purport to be a complete summary of all applicable laws, rules and regulations governing banks and bank holding companies or the Company or the Bank. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the specific statutes, regulations and policies discussed. Any change in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory policies may have a material effect on our businesses, operations and prospects. We are unable to predict the nature or extent of the effects that economic controls or new federal or state legislation may have on our business and earnings in the future.    ﻿
 Regulatory Agencies 
 ﻿
 Guaranty Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank subsidiary, Guaranty Bank. As a bank holding company, Guaranty Bancorp is regulated under the BHC Act and is subject to inspection, examination and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Reserve Board. Guaranty Bancorp is also under the jurisdiction of the SEC and is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Guaranty Bancorp is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the trading symbol “GBNK,” and is subject to the rules of Nasdaq for listed companies.

As a Colorado-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to supervision, periodic examination and regulation by the CDB. As a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is also subject to supervision, periodic examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, or the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Bank is subject to certain rules and regulations of the CFPB, and PCM is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, as amended. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to certain established limits.
 ﻿
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
 ﻿
 On July 21, 2010, former President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which implemented and continues to implement significant changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. 
 ﻿
 The effects of the Dodd-Frank Act have been far-reaching, and many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to rulemaking by various regulatory agencies and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Company, its customers or the financial industry more generally. Provisions in the legislation that require revisions to the capital requirements of the Company and the Bank could require the Company and the Bank to seek additional sources of capital in the future.
 ﻿
 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
 ﻿
 On December 22, 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ''Tax Act''). Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740-10-25-14 states that the effect of a change in tax law or rates shall be recognized at the date of enactment. Because the law was signed in December 2017, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are accounted for in 2017 financial statements to reflect the new rates. These changes to the tax treatment of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities together with the elimination of loss carrybacks could result in capital implications. Management is carefully studying the impact of the Tax Act.
 ﻿
 Bank Holding Company Regulations Applicable to Guaranty Bancorp
 ﻿
 The BHC Act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations.
 ﻿
 Permitted activities. Generally, bank holding companies are prohibited under the BHC Act from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in any activity other than (i) banking or managing or controlling banks or (ii) an activity that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking. The Federal Reserve Board has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries or affiliates when the Federal Reserve Board believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any of its banking subsidiaries.
 ﻿
 A bank holding company that qualifies and elects to become a financial holding company is permitted to engage in additional activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to financial activity. We currently have no plans to make a financial holding company election.
 ﻿
 Sound banking practices. Bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in activities that represent unsafe and unsound banking practices. For example, under certain circumstances the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation Y requires a holding company to give the Federal Reserve Board prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate a regulation. As another example, a holding company is prohibited from impairing its subsidiary bank’s soundness by causing the bank to make funds available to non-banking subsidiaries or their customers if the Federal Reserve believes it not prudent to do so. The Federal Reserve Board has the power to assess civil money penalties for knowing or reckless violations, if the activities leading to a violation caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. Potential penalties are as high as $1,963,870 for each day the activity continues.
 ﻿

Source of Strength. In accordance with Federal Reserve Board policy, the holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank. Under this policy, the holding company is expected to commit resources to support its bank subsidiary, including at times when the holding company may not be in a financial position to provide it. As discussed below, the holding company could be required to guarantee the capital plan of the Bank if it becomes undercapitalized for purposes of banking regulations. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. The BHC Act provides that, in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a bank subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.
 ﻿
 Regulatory agencies have promulgated regulations to increase the capital requirements for bank holding companies to a level that matches those of banking institutions.
 ﻿
 Anti-tying restrictions. Bank holding companies and affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by a holding company or its affiliates, subject to certain exceptions. 
 ﻿
 Acquisitions. The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, the Colorado Banking Code and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of commercial banks and their holding companies. The BHC Act generally limits acquisitions by bank holding companies to commercial banks and companies engaged in activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of any bank or other bank holding company, (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company, or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company.
 ﻿
 In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities generally consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the combined organization (including the capital position of the combined organization), the applicant’s performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act (see the section captioned “Community Reinvestment Act” later in Item 1), fair housing laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities.
 ﻿
 The Company is also subject to the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978 (the “Control Act”) and related Federal Reserve Board regulations, which provide that any person who proposes to acquire at least 10% (but less than 25%) of any class of a bank holding company’s voting securities is presumed to control the company (unless the company is not publicly held and some other shareholder owns a greater percentage of voting stock). Any person who would be presumed to acquire control or who proposes to acquire control of more than 25% of any class of a bank holding company’s voting securities, or who proposes to acquire actual control, must provide the Federal Reserve Board with at least 60 days prior written notice of the acquisition. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove a proposed acquisition if (i) it would result in adverse competitive effects, (ii) the financial condition of the acquiring person might jeopardize the target institution’s financial stability or prejudice the interests of depositors, (iii) the competence, experience or integrity of any acquiring person indicates that the proposed acquisition would not be in the best interests of the depositors or the public, or (iv) the acquiring person fails to provide all of the information required by the Federal Reserve Board. Any proposed acquisition of the voting securities of a bank holding company that is subject to approval under the BHC Act is not subject to the Control Act notice requirements. Any company that proposes to acquire “control”, as those terms are defined in the BHC Act and Federal Reserve Board regulations, of a bank holding company or to acquire 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank holding company would be required to seek the Federal Reserve Board’s prior approval under the BHC Act to become a bank holding company.
 ﻿
 Dividends. Dividends from the Bank are the holding company’s principal source of cash revenues. Our earnings and activities are affected by legislation, by regulations and by local legislative and administrative bodies and decisions of courts in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. These include limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the holding company and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiary. Consistent with such policy, a banking organization should have 

 
9


 

comprehensive policies on dividend payments that clearly articulate the organization’s objectives and approaches for maintaining a strong capital position and achieving the objectives of the policy statement.
 ﻿
 In 2009, the Federal Reserve Board issued a supervisory letter providing greater clarity to its policy statement on the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In this letter, the Federal Reserve Board stated that when a holding company’s board of directors is deciding on the level of dividends to declare, it should consider, among other factors: (i) overall asset quality, potential need to increase reserves and write down assets, and concentrations of credit; (ii) potential for unanticipated losses and declines in asset values; (iii) implicit and explicit liquidity and credit commitments, including off-balance sheet and contingent liabilities; (iv) quality and level of current and prospective earnings, including earnings capacity under a number of plausible economic scenarios; (v) current and prospective cash flow and liquidity; (vi) ability to serve as an ongoing source of financial and managerial strength to depository institution subsidiaries insured by the FDIC, including the extent of double leverage and the condition of subsidiary depository institutions; (vii) other risks that affect the holding company’s financial condition and are not fully captured in regulatory capital calculations; (viii) level, composition, and quality of capital; and (ix) ability to raise additional equity capital in prevailing market and economic conditions (the “Dividend Factors”). It is particularly important for a bank holding company’s board of directors to ensure that the dividend level is prudent relative to the organization’s financial position and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios. In addition, a bank holding company’s board of directors should strongly consider, after careful analysis of the Dividend Factors, reducing, deferring, or eliminating dividends when the quantity and quality of the holding company's earnings have declined or the holding company is experiencing other financial problems, or when the macroeconomic outlook for the holding company's primary profit centers has deteriorated. The Federal Reserve Board further stated that, as a general matter, a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce its distributions if: (a) its net income is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (b) its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or (c) it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Failure to do so could result in a supervisory finding that the bank holding company is operating in an unsafe and unsound manner.
 ﻿
 Additionally, as discussed above, the Federal Reserve Board possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries with which it can prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices, or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies.
 ﻿
 Stock Redemptions and Repurchases. It is an essential principle of safety and soundness that a banking organization’s redemption and repurchases of regulatory capital instruments, including common stock, from investors be consistent with the organization’s current and prospective capital needs. In assessing such needs, the board of directors and management of a bank holding company should consider the Dividend Factors discussed above under “Dividends”. The risk-based capital rule directs bank holding companies to consult with the Federal Reserve before redeeming any equity or other capital instrument included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital prior to stated maturity, if such redemption could have a material effect on the level or composition of the organization’s capital base. Bank holding companies that are experiencing financial weaknesses, or that are at significant risk of developing financial weaknesses, must consult with the appropriate Federal Reserve supervisory staff before redeeming or repurchasing common stock or other regulatory capital instruments for cash or other valuable consideration. Similarly, any bank holding company considering expansion, whether through acquisitions or through organic growth and new activities, generally also must consult with the appropriate Federal Reserve supervisory staff before redeeming or repurchasing common stock or other regulatory capital instruments for cash or other valuable consideration. In evaluating the appropriateness of a bank holding company’s proposed redemption or repurchase of capital instruments, the Federal Reserve will consider the potential losses that the holding company may suffer from the prospective need to increase reserves and write down assets from continued asset deterioration and the holding company’s ability to raise additional common stock and other Tier 1 capital to replace capital instruments that are redeemed or repurchased. A bank holding company must inform the Federal Reserve of a redemption or repurchase of common stock or perpetual preferred stock for cash or other value resulting in a net reduction of the bank holding company’s outstanding amount of common stock or perpetual preferred stock below the amount of such capital instrument outstanding at the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurs. In addition, a bank holding company must advise the Federal Reserve sufficiently in advance of such redemptions and repurchases to provide reasonable opportunity for supervisory review and possible objection should the Federal Reserve determine a transaction raises safety and soundness concerns.
 ﻿
 Regulation Y requires that a bank holding company that is not well capitalized or well managed, or that is subject to any unresolved supervisory issues, provide prior notice to the Federal Reserve for any repurchase or 

 
10


 

redemption of its equity securities for cash or other value that would reduce by 10% or more the holding company's consolidated net worth aggregated over the preceding 12-month period.
 ﻿
 Annual Reporting; Examinations. The holding company is required to file an annual report with the Federal Reserve Board, and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require. The Federal Reserve Board may examine a bank holding company and any of its subsidiaries, and charge the company for the cost of such an examination.
 ﻿
 Imposition of Liability for Undercapitalized Subsidiaries. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) requires bank regulators to take “prompt corrective action” to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions. In the event an institution becomes “undercapitalized,” it must submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company “having control of” the undercapitalized institution “guarantees” the subsidiary’s compliance with the capital restoration plan until it becomes “adequately capitalized.” For purposes of this statute, the holding company has control of the Bank. Under FDICIA, the aggregate liability of all companies controlling a particular institution is limited to the lesser of five percent of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to bring the institution into compliance with applicable capital standards. FDICIA grants greater powers to bank regulators in situations where an institution becomes “significantly” or “critically” undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan. For example, a bank holding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior Federal Reserve Board approval of proposed distributions, or might be required to consent to a merger or to divest the troubled institution or other affiliates.
 ﻿
 Transactions with Affiliates. The holding company and the Bank are considered “affiliates” of each other under the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between such affiliates are subject to certain restrictions, including compliance with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and their implementing regulations. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B: (1) limit the extent to which a financial institution or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions (a) with an affiliate (as defined in such sections) to an amount equal to 10% of such institution’s capital and surplus, and (b) with all affiliates, in the aggregate to an amount equal to 20% of such capital and surplus; and (2) require all transactions with an affiliate, whether or not covered transactions, to be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution or subsidiary, as the terms provided or that would be provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and other similar types of transactions.
 ﻿
 State Law Restrictions. As a Delaware corporation, the holding company is subject to certain limitations and restrictions under applicable Delaware corporate law. For example, state law restrictions in Delaware include limitations and restrictions relating to indemnification of directors, distributions and dividends to stockholders, transactions involving directors, officers or interested stockholders, maintenance of books, records, and minutes, and observance of certain corporate formalities.

 Capital Adequacy and Prompt Corrective Action – Guaranty Bancorp and Guaranty Bank
 ﻿
 The federal banking regulatory authorities’ risk-based capital guidelines were previously based upon the 1988 capital accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, or Basel I. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors and regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country’s supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply. In 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published a new capital accord to replace Basel I, with an update in November 2005 (“Basel II”). Basel II provided two approaches for setting capital standards for credit risk — an internal ratings-based approach tailored to individual institutions’ circumstances (which for many asset classes is itself broken into a “foundation” approach and an “advanced or A-IRB” approach, the availability of which is subject to additional restrictions) and a standardized approach that based risk weightings on external credit assessments to a much greater extent than permitted in previous risk-based capital guidelines. Basel II also set capital requirements for operational risk and refined the existing capital requirements for market risk exposures.
 ﻿
 In July 2007, the U.S. banking and thrift agencies reached an agreement on the implementation of the capital adequacy regulations and standards based on Basel II. In November 2007, the agencies approved final rules to implement the new risk-based capital requirements in the United States for large, internationally active banking organizations, or “core banks” - defined as those with consolidated total assets of $250 billion or more or consolidated on-balance sheet foreign exposures of $10 billion or more. The final rule was effective as of April 1, 2008. We are not a core bank and do not apply the Basel II approach to computing risk-weighted assets.

In response to the economic and financial industry crisis that began in 2008, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and their oversight body - the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) – set out in late 2009 to work on global initiatives to strengthen the financial regulatory system. In July 2010, the GHOS agreed on key design elements and in September 2010 agreed to transition and implementation of measures. This work is known as Basel III, and it is designed to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking sector. In particular, Basel III strengthens existing capital requirements and introduces a global liquidity standard. In June 2012, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) jointly issued three notices of proposed rulemaking (“NPRs”) to, among other things implement the Basel III minimum capital requirements. Following the receipt of comment letters from multiple U.S. financial institutions, on November 9, 2012, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the OCC indefinitely delayed the start date for the Basel III capital requirements and stated that they did not expect the final rules to implement the Basel III capital requirements to be in effect on January 1, 2013, the initial deadline. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and OCC issued two final interim rules to implement the Basel III capital reforms and the rules began phasing-in in 2015, depending on the size of the financial institution. For more on Basel III and its potential effect on us, see item 1A “Risk Factors”. 
 ﻿
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (“FDIA”), requires, among other things, that federal banking agencies take “prompt corrective action” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA sets forth the following five capital tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The relevant capital measures are the total capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio, the leverage ratio and a new ratio requirement under Basel III, the common equity Tier I capital ratio.
 ﻿
 Under the regulations adopted by the federal regulatory authorities, a bank is: (i) “well capitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) “adequately capitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not “well capitalized”; (iii) “undercapitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%; (iv) “significantly undercapitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 3.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and (v) “critically undercapitalized” if the institution’s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank’s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank’s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.
 ﻿
 The final rules also established a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum capital ratios, and when fully effective in 2019, will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement began phasing-in in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its buffer level falls below the required buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such activities. 
 ﻿
 The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan to the FDIC. The agencies may not accept such a plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5.0% of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or 

 
12


 

would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.”
 ﻿
 “Significantly undercapitalized” depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.
 ﻿
 Both Guaranty Bank and Guaranty Bancorp have always maintained the capital ratios and leverage ratio above the levels to be considered quantitatively well-capitalized. For information regarding the capital ratios and leverage ratio of the Company and the Bank as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, see the discussion under the section captioned “Capital Resources” included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 21 —Regulatory Capital Matters in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, elsewhere in this report.
 ﻿
 Banking Regulations Applicable to Guaranty Bank
 ﻿
 Branching. Colorado state law provides that a Colorado-chartered bank can establish a branch anywhere in Colorado provided that the branch is approved in advance by the CDB. The branch must also be approved by the Federal Reserve. The approval process takes into account a number of factors, including financial history, capital adequacy, earnings prospects, character of management, needs of the community and consistency with corporate powers. The Dodd-Frank Act also reduced any significant barriers to interstate branching.
 ﻿
 Dividends. As a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is subject to Regulation H, which, among other things, provides that a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during the calendar year, including the proposed dividend, exceeds the sum of the bank’s net income (as reportable in its Reports of Condition and Income) during the current calendar year and its retained net income for the prior two calendar years, unless the Federal Reserve has approved the dividend. Regulation H also provides that a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend if the dividend would exceed the bank’s undivided profits as reportable on its Reports of Condition and Income, unless the Federal Reserve and holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of each class of the bank’s outstanding stock have approved the dividend. Additionally, there are potential additional restrictions and prohibitions if a bank were to be less than well-capitalized.
 ﻿
 As a Colorado state-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to limitations under Colorado law on the payment of dividends. The Colorado Banking Code provides that a bank may declare dividends from retained earnings and other components of capital specifically approved by the Banking Board so long as the declaration is made in compliance with rules established by the Banking Board.
 ﻿
 Deposit Insurance. The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The FDIC utilizes a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank’s capital level and supervisory rating. Risk Category I is the lowest risk category while Risk Category IV is the highest risk category.
 ﻿
 In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act revised certain statutes governing the FDIC’s management of the DIF. Among other things, the revisions raised the minimum fund reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% and required the fund reserve ratio to reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020. In August 2016, the FDIC announced that the fund reserve ratio had surpassed 1.15% as of June 30, 2016. As a result, beginning in the third quarter of 2016, the range of initial assessment rates for all institutions was adjusted downward and institutions with $10 billion or more in assets were assessed a quarterly surcharge. The quarterly surcharge will continue to be assessed until such time as the reserve ratio reaches the statutory minimum of 1.35% required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Company had $3.7 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2017 and therefore was not subject to the quarterly surcharge. At December 31, 2017, the Bank’s total assessment rate was approximately three basis points.
 ﻿
 The FDIC may further increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule in order to manage the DIF to prescribed statutory target levels. An increase in the risk category for the Bank or in the assessment rates could have an adverse effect on the Bank’s and consequently the Company’s earnings. The FDIC may terminate deposit insurance if it determines the institution involved has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe or unsound banking 

 
13


 

practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition, or has violated applicable laws, regulations or orders. In the case of a Colorado-chartered bank, the termination of deposit insurance would result in the revocation of its charter.
 ﻿
 In addition, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (FICO), a mixed-ownership government corporation established to recapitalize a predecessor to the DIF. The current annualized assessment rate is six basis points and the rate is adjusted quarterly. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2019.
 ﻿
 The enactment of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 then-temporarily raised the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor and in July of 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act made the increased coverage amount permanent.
 ﻿
 The Volcker Rule. Through the Volcker Rule, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investments companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds). The Volcker Rule, which became effective in July 2015, does not significantly affect our operations, as we generally do not engage in the businesses prohibited by the Volcker Rule. 
 ﻿
 Depositor Preference. The FDIA provides that, in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.
 ﻿
 Consumer Financial Protection. The Company is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern its relationship with its customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws’ respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws, privacy and data security laws, and laws regarding unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive acts or practices, restrict the Company’s ability to raise interest rates and subject the Company to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys’ fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which we operate and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in our failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions the Company may want to pursue or our prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required. 
 ﻿
 Further, the CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of enumerated consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer’s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer’s: (i) lack of financial savvy, (ii) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (iii) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer’s interests.
 ﻿
 Brokered Deposit Restrictions. Well-capitalized institutions are not subject to limitations on brokered deposits, while an adequately capitalized institution is able to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC and subject to certain restrictions on the yield paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions are generally not permitted to accept, renew, or roll over brokered deposits.
 ﻿
 Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“the CRA”), requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, 

 
14


 

among other things, providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities and to communities that are part of federal disaster areas. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. The applicable federal regulators regularly conduct CRA examinations to assess the performance of financial institutions and assign one of four ratings to the institution’s records of meeting the credit needs of its community. During its last examination, a rating of “satisfactory” was received by the Bank.
 ﻿
 Insider Credit Transactions. Banks are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to certain executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and any related interests of such persons. Extensions of credit to such persons must: (i) be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not covered by such restrictions and (ii) not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank, the imposition of a cease and desist order, and other regulatory sanctions.
 ﻿
 Concentration in Commercial Real Estate Lending. As a part of their regulatory oversight, the federal regulators have issued guidelines on sound risk management practices with respect to a financial institution’s concentrations in commercial real estate (“CRE”) lending activities. The guidelines identify certain concentration levels that, if exceeded, will expose the institution to additional supervisory analysis surrounding the institution’s CRE concentration risk. The guidelines are designed to promote appropriate levels of capital and sound loan and risk management practices for institutions with a concentration of CRE loans. In general, the guidelines establish two concentration levels. First, a concentration is deemed to exist if the institution’s total construction, land development and other land loans represent 100 percent or more of total risk-based capital (“CRE 1 Concentration”). Second, a concentration will be deemed to exist if total loans for construction, land development and other land and loans secured by multifamily and non-owner occupied non-farm residential properties (excluding loans secured by owner-occupied properties) represent 300 percent or more of total risk-based capital (“CRE 2 Concentration”) and the institution’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50 percent or more during the prior 36 month period. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank’s CRE 1 Concentration level was 41 percent and the Bank’s CRE 2 Concentration level was 328 percent. The Bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio increased by 70 percent during the prior 36 months. Excluding loans acquired in the transactions with Home State and Castle Rock, the balance of commercial real estate loans increased by 41 percent during the preceding 36 months. Management employs heightened risk management practices with respect to commercial real estate lending, including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development and underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing. At December 31, 2017 we have concluded that we have an acceptable and well-managed concentration in commercial real estate lending under the foregoing standards.
 ﻿
 FDICIA. Under FDICIA, each federal banking agency has prescribed, by regulation, non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority. These standards cover internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation. An institution which fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that the institution will take to meet the standards. Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions.
 ﻿
 Examinations. The Bank is examined from time to time by its primary federal banking regulator, the Federal Reserve, and the CDB, and is charged for the cost of such an examination. Depending on the results of a given examination, the Federal Reserve and the CDB may revalue the Bank’s assets and require that the Bank establish specific reserves to compensate for the difference between the value determined by the regulator and the book value of the assets.
 ﻿
 Financial Privacy. In accordance with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (the “GLB Act”), federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors.
 ﻿
 Anti-Money Laundering Initiatives and the USA Patriot Act. A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions over the last decade has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA 

 
15


 

PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “USA Patriot Act”), substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions such as the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identities of their customers. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must use enhanced due diligence procedures in their dealings with certain types of high-risk customers and implement a written customer identification program. Financial institutions must take certain steps to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and reporting certain types of suspicious transactions. Regulatory authorities routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with these obligations, and failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, can have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.
 ﻿
 Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation. The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the “OFAC” rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. The Company is responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.
 ﻿
 Other Laws and Regulations. The Company is not only subject to federal laws applicable to it, it is also subject to the rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws.
 ﻿
 Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies
 ﻿
 In 2010, the federal bank regulators jointly issued final guidance on sound incentive compensation policies (“SICP”) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The SICP guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should: (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The SICP guidance provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
 ﻿
 During the second quarter of 2016, the U.S. financial regulators proposed revised rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets, including the Company and the Bank. The proposed revised rules would establish general requirements applicable to all covered entities, which would include: (i) prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation; (ii) prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss; (iii) establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward; (iv) requiring board of director oversight of incentive arrangements; and (v) mandating appropriate record-keeping.

Cybersecurity
 ﻿
 In March 2015, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.
 ﻿
 In April 2015, the SEC issued cybersecurity guidance for Registered Investment Advisors. The guidance highlighted the importance of having strong cybersecurity controls in place and discussed a number of measures that advisers may wish to consider when addressing cybersecurity risks. Some of the measures firms may choose to implement include, but are not limited to, conducting periodic assessments that identify the nature, sensitivity, and location of the information that an adviser collects, processes, and stores. Advisers should also evaluate internal and external cybersecurity and vulnerabilities along with the security controls and measures in place. Advisers are also encouraged to create a strategy that is designed to prevent, detect, and respond to cybersecurity threats and ensure that the strategy is implemented in day-to-day operations. The SEC continues to reinforce the importance of cybersecurity measures by including this in the list of their exam priorities since 2014. Most recently, in February 2018 the SEC indicated that cybersecurity would continue to be a focus in their examination programs. SEC examinations have, and will continue to focus on, governance and risk assessment, access rights and controls, data loss prevention, vendor management, training, and incident response.
 ﻿
 In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. We employ an in-depth, layered, defensive approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyber-attacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. While to date, we have not experienced a significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. See “Risk Factors” for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity.
 ﻿
 Changing Regulatory Structure and Future Legislation and Regulation
 ﻿
 Congress may enact further legislation that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact further legislation affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in these states. Changes in leadership at various federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, can also change the policy direction of these agencies. Management is monitoring these policy changes. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations, or the application thereof, although enactment of the proposed legislation could impact the regulatory structure under which the Company operates and may significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, require an increase in regulatory capital, require modifications to the Company’s business strategy, and limit the Company’s ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on our business.
 ﻿

Monetary Policy and Economic Environment
 ﻿
 The policies of regulatory authorities, including the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board, can have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the means available to the Federal Reserve Board to affect the money supply are open market operations in United States Government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The Federal Reserve Board’s monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The nature of future monetary policies and the effect of these policies on the Bank’s business and earnings cannot be predicted.
 ﻿
 Employees 
 ﻿
 At December 31, 2017, we employed 517 employees, including 487 full-time employees and 30 part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations to be good.
