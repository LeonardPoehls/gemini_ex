Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Union Bridge Holdings Limited was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 6, 2014. We are a development-stage company initially formed to commence operations in the distribution of auto parts and components necessary for the maintenance and repair of automobiles and other specialty equipment.
 
The Company's operations involve the organization and distribution of auto parts and components necessary for maintenance and repair of automobiles and special equipment (i.e. construction, road machinery etc.) from China to Europe and certain Commonwealth of Independent States which include Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and the Ukraine.
 
Many manufacturers transfer their production facilities to China because of reduced production and operating costs. In addition, China has its own automobile brands that are actively entering the world market. Concurrently, China has developed associative production facilities producing a wide selection of parts and components for various types of equipment and the Chinese parts market also produces alternatives (i.e. parts-analogues), which are virtually no different from the original parts and meet all the standards and the technical properties of the original. The Company is evaluating the viability of its auto parts business.
 
On February 18, 2016, Yuhua Xu, the controlling shareholder, Chief Executive Officer and sole director of the Company, entered into and closed on a Share Purchase Agreement with Mary Ho, Rudolf Novotny, Shan Ho, Lily Ho and Moana Ho (each a “Purchaser” and collectively, the “Purchasers”) whereby the Purchasers purchased a total of 7,990,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Shares”) from Yuhua Xu, for an aggregate price of $223,720. The Shares acquired represent approximately 74.53% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. 
 
Concurrently with the closing of the Share Purchase Agreement, Yuhua Xu, resigned as an officer and director of the Company and Moana Ho was appointed President and Chairman of the Board of Directors and Hui Zhou was appointed as a Chief Financial Officer and Director.
