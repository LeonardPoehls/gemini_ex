Item 1. Business
General
 
Throughout this report, we refer to Aly Energy Services, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, as “we,” “our”, “us,” “Aly Energy” or the “Company.” References to financial results and operations of the Company are limited to continuing operations unless otherwise specified.
 
We are a growth-oriented provider of oilfield services to leading oil and gas exploration and production (“E&P”) companies operating in unconventional plays in the United States (“U.S.”). Generally, the services we offer fall within two broad categories: surface rental and solids control. Our surface rental equipment includes a wide variety of large capacity tanks with integral circulating systems, associated pumps, separators, gas busters, mud mix plants and ancillary equipment necessary to manage the flow of mud in and out of the well bore during drilling operations. We also provide environmental containment berms to safeguard against spills from the mud system. Our solids control equipment and services remove low gravity formation particulates that accumulate in mud systems during the drilling process. Solids control equipment includes large centrifuges, shakers, cuttings dryers and ancillary components that can be integrated into a closed loop mud system. Once processed, the mud can be reused which eliminates unnecessary waste and disposal.
 
History
 
On July 17, 2012, Munawar “Micki” Hidayatallah founded Aly Energy with the strategic objective of creating an oilfield services company that would serve E&P companies operating in unconventional plays. Previously, Mr. Hidayatallah had followed a similar strategy at Allis-Chalmers Energy Inc., a company which he founded in 2001. Allis-Chalmers Energy Inc. grew organically and through acquisitions over a 10-year period and generated over $675 million in revenue during 2011. Aly Energy has created a public platform to pursue a similar strategy to Allis-Chalmers Energy Inc.
 
From 2012 through 2014, we grew our business substantially both through the strategic acquisition of certain businesses operating in our industry and through organic growth. We have fully integrated the completed acquisitions and we operate as a single provider which offers our customers a comprehensive solution for their drilling fluid management needs.
 
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, in conjunction with depressed commodity prices and a substantial decrease in the U.S. land-drilling rig count (“Rig Count”), there was a massive decline in demand for oilfield services which continued through the first half of 2016. The industry downturn negatively impacted our financial results in both 2015 and 2016 and we had very limited liquidity throughout both years.
 
Recent Trends and Outlook
 
By January 31, 2017, we had successfully navigated through the industry downturn by implementing an operational restructuring, including severe cost cutting measures, and significantly deleveraging the business by successfully entering into a capital restructuring transaction, the “Recapitalization”. (See further discussion in “Note 2 – Recent Developments” and “Note 3 – Recapitalization” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.) As a direct result of the Recapitalization, we were well-positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities in 2017.
 
Such growth opportunities were created primarily from a significant increase in demand for oilfield services when compared to the two preceding years. Two of the most significant drivers of demand for our services, the price of oil and the Rig Count, increased substantially year-over-year from 2016 to 2017. The positive impact of these improved industry conditions on the Company is reflected in the increased utilization of our equipment and services and our ability to raise the prices we charge to our customers. Increased utilization and increased pricing resulted in a significant amount of incremental revenue in 2017 when compared to 2016 and a significant overall improvement in our financial results and liquidity.
 
Our business depends to a significant extent on the level of unconventional resource development activity and corresponding capital spending of E&P companies onshore in the U.S. These activity and spending levels are strongly influenced by the current and expected oil price. Commodity prices declined significantly between the third quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2016. However, oil prices have since gradually increased and this price recovery has stimulated an increase in onshore drilling and completion activity and a consequent increase in demand for our services. The average Rig Count for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 77.4% to 864 rigs as compared to 487 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The favorable impact of the recent increase in the Rig Count on demand for our services has been magnified by an increase in the proportion of rigs drilling directional and horizontal wells. Rigs drilling directional and horizontal wells typically utilize oil-based or other sophisticated mud systems which creates demand for our specialized mud circulating tanks, pumps, containment systems, solids control and associated equipment. The proportion of rigs drilling directional and horizontal wells as a percentage of total U.S. land-based rigs has increased to 93.1% during the fourth quarter of 2017 from approximately 88.7% in the first quarter of 2016.

If the current commodity price environment holds or continues to improve, we anticipate a further increase in demand for our services. In addition, our customers are increasingly focused on efficient drilling of high intensity wells with long laterals which further enhances the demand for our services. As demand increases, we expect that utilization will increase and our ability to increase the prices for our equipment and services will improve resulting in greater margins and increased margins as a percent of revenue.
 
We will continue to expand our business through a low risk strategy of growing organically by replacing our sub-rented equipment with newly purchased, refurbished or fabricated equipment. We will also evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that would provide geographic diversification, expand our products and services and introduce us to new customers.
 
Products and Services
 
We are a provider of solids control systems and surface rental equipment. Our equipment and services are primarily designed for and used in land-based horizontal drilling. Our equipment includes centrifuges and auxiliary solids control equipment, mud circulating tanks (400 and 500 barrel capacity) and auxiliary surface rental equipment (e.g. portable mud mixing plants, and containment systems). In conjunction with the rental of some of our solids control packages, we provide personnel at the customer’s well site to operate our equipment. We also provide personnel to rig-up/rig-down and haul our equipment to and from the customer’s location.
Our Rental Products:
 
Centrifuges: We currently own approximately 48 centrifuges. We provide two different sizes of centrifuges to meet varying client specifications (SS1000 and SS2000). We believe our centrifuges provide a competitive advantage because the rotating assembly within each centrifuge can be removed and replaced on a customer’s well site within 45 minutes if it fails thereby minimizing downtime. Certain customers rent centrifuges with auxiliary equipment such as shakers, vertical dryers, waste removal units, and/or various tanks.
Mud Circulating Tanks (“MCTs”): We currently own approximately 60 vertical 400-barrel MCTs and approximately 129 500-barrel MCTs. We developed vertical 400-barrel MCTs as an innovative solution that minimizes location size, which we believe is an attractive feature for customers. The majority of our 500-barrel MCTs are highly mobile with rounded bottoms and customized jet-lines to ensure more consistent mud and easier cleanout at the completion of a job. In addition to the 500-barrel MCTs we own, we sub-rent 500-barrel MCTs (approximately 230 sub-rented as of December 31, 2017) in order to satisfy demand for our services. MCTs are typically rented to customers with auxiliary equipment such as diesel or electric mud pumps, hoses, and wooden mats.
Mud Mixing Plants (“MMPs”): We own 9 MMPs ranging in size from 100-barrel capacity to 500-barrel capacity. We believe that the large 400-barrel and 500-barrel capacity MMPs, which are designed and fabricated in-house, are unique and offer significant advantages to our customers.
Containment Systems: Containment systems consist of berms and plastic linings constructed to ensure that all products and chemicals present on the well site, particularly those which might be environmentally undesirable if spilled, are contained. We believe the demand for containment systems will continue to increase as environmental regulations tighten.
Our Service Offerings Which Include Personnel:
 
Solids Control Services: When a customer’s solids control operations are complex, we provide operators on-site 24 hours a day at an additional day rate. In these instances, we typically rent a full package of solids control equipment to the customer, which may include two centrifuges, shakers, vertical dryers, waste removal units, and/or various tanks. 
 
Hauling of Equipment and Rig-Up/Rig-Down Services: We offer hauling of our rental equipment to the well site and rig-up/rig-down of such equipment.

Fabricating Capabilities
 
We fabricate certain equipment in our rental fleet, including 400-barrel MCTs and MMPs. Fabrication primarily takes place in our facility in Giddings, Texas. Items fabricated in-house are typically unique and we believe our ability to fabricate such products in-house provides us with cost efficiencies that result in a competitive advantage. 
Geographic Markets
 
We operate in the U.S., primarily in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. Within these states, we have a very strong footprint in the Permian Basin, one of the largest and most prolific shale plays in the U.S., and we also provide services in the Scoop/Stack region and Eagle Ford shale.
Competition
 
We experience significant competition in our business. The markets in which we operate are highly fragmented and there are a large number of companies in these markets offering rental equipment and services that overlap with our offerings. We believe the principal differentiators among competitors in the sectors and markets in which we operate are safety record, service quality, existence of unique attributes of equipment that benefit the customer, customer relationships, response time and price. 
 
The level of our revenue, earnings and cash flows are substantially dependent upon, and affected by, the level of U.S. oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activity, as well as the equipment capacity in any particular region.

 
Customers
 
We cultivate and maintain strong relationships with our customers which include some of the largest independent oil and gas E&P companies operating in the U.S. shale basins. During 2017, we serviced over 40 customers, including leading companies such as EOG Resources, Inc., Pioneer Natural Resources, XTO Energy Inc., Sanchez Oil and Gas Corporation and Devon Energy Corporation.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our top three customers represented approximately 56.0% and 43.5% of total revenue, respectively. 
 
If we are unable to continue to provide services to our top three existing customers and sales to new or other existing customers do not increase sufficiently, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected.
 
Raw Materials
 
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are made by other manufacturers and suppliers for our use. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials. 

Safety
 
Our record and reputation for safety is important to all aspects of our business. In the oilfield services industry, an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships is having an experienced, skilled and well-trained work force. In recent years, many of our larger customers have placed an added emphasis on the safety records and quality management systems of their vendors.
 
We commit substantial resources toward employee safety and quality management. We believe our policies and procedures provide a solid framework to ensure our employees minimize the hazards inherent in our work environment, meet regulatory requirements and exceed customer expectations.

Employees
 
As of March 26, 2018, we employed approximately 65 individuals. The corporate cost center employs six individuals, including the chairman, the chief executive officer, the chief operating officer and the chief financial officer, approximately 48 individuals work primarily in the field, and the remaining employees provide selling, general, and administrative services. We believe we have good relationships with our employees.

Seasonality
 
We have historically experienced a slowdown during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday seasons and demand in the fourth quarter sometimes slows as our customers exhaust their annual spending budgets. 
Intangibles
 
We are not dependent on any significant patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts. In the last two years, we have not spent or incurred a material amount on research and development activities.
Governmental Regulation
 
Our business is impacted by federal, state and local laws and other regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry, as well as laws and regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection. We cannot predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations or how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings, whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted, or the effect such changes may have on us, our business or financial condition.
 
In addition, our customers are impacted by laws and regulations relating to the exploration for and production of natural resources such as oil and natural gas. These regulations are subject to change, and new regulations may curtail or eliminate our customers’ activities in certain areas where we currently operate. We cannot determine the extent to which new legislation may impact our customers’ activity levels, and ultimately, the demand for our services.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our operations, and those of our customers, are subject to extensive laws, regulations and treaties relating to air and water quality, generation, storage and handling of hazardous materials, and emission and discharge of materials into the environment. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all regulations affecting our business. Historically, our expenditures in furtherance of our compliance with these laws, regulations and treaties have not been material, and we do not expect the cost of compliance to be material in the future.
