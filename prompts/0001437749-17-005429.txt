Our Business Model
 
The scope of client clinical trial support service needs can vary from trial to trial.  Experience with EDC and other eClinical trial management solutions can also vary based on such factors as client size and sophistication.  Our approach to satisfying the diverse needs of our customers is to offer a variety of EDC solutions.  We offer our eClinical Products under an application service provider (“ASP”) business model as well as technology transition (“Technology Transition”) and technology transfer (“Technology Transfer”) business models (both of which are considered licensed).
  
We offer a fully hosted Technology Transition model designed to allow the client to bring study administration and set-up services in-house yet continue to host the solution with us, as well as a complete Technology Transfer model for clients that want to keep their eClinical technology solution completely in-house. This methodology allows our customers to use our services at their own pace, given the logistics of their human resource, infrastructure and capital constraints.  This model allows us the flexibility to deliver eClinical solutions to a broader array of clinical trial sponsors.
 
Our Software Products and Services
 
TrialMaster EDC Solution
 
Our core product is TrialMaster, which allows organizations conducting clinical trials to collect and manage their clinical trial data over the internet. Users at investigative sites such as hospitals and doctors’ offices can enter data into electronic forms that represent the study protocol, and the data is immediately validated against a set of protocol-specific rules. For example, a rule could check that a medication start date is earlier than the medication stop date, and prompt the user to correct any errors before proceeding. Compared to paper studies such real-time feedback dramatically improves the initial data quality. This in turn decreases the time it takes to analyze the study results, helping pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device companies bring their products to market sooner.
 
We believe TrialMaster has a number of competitive strengths when compared to other EDC products. A key differentiator is that the rule checks described above are implemented using JavaScript, giving a highly-responsive user experience. For example, if a medication is marked as “continuing,” the stop date field can be immediately disabled, preventing inconsistent data from being entered. Additionally, TrialMaster has an intuitive user interface, easy navigation, and robust tools for monitoring and tracking the state of the data at any time. Finally, TrialMaster has open Application Programming Interfaces (“API”) that allow other clinical trial applications to send data to and receive data from TrialMaster over the internet. For example, laboratory data can be transmitted and loaded automatically, while an external project management system could inquire about how many patients were enrolled in a particular TrialMaster study and update a summary table accordingly.
 
TrialMaster has an integrated electronic learning system, a comprehensive set of standard reports and integrated ad-hoc reporting using a sophisticated business intelligence tool called LogiXML®.  TrialMaster allows the collected data to be extracted in a variety of standard formats, such as database tables, comma-delimited files, and SAS® datasets. The latest release also allows the data to be extracted in an industry-standard format called SDTM, simply by defining mappings between the input and output data structures. We believe this feature can save our customers considerable programming time.
 
It is standard practice to monitor all the data in the EDC system against the source medical records, an activity called Source Document Verification (“SDV”). In 2011, the FDA issued draft guidance stating, among other things, that it was no longer necessary to perform 100% SDV, providing the data selection was part of a risk-based monitoring plan. TrialMaster includes a facility called “dynamic monitoring,” which allows organizations conducting clinical trials to select a subset of data for SDV based on a configurable, statistical algorithm. This capability allows TrialMaster customers to save significant costs in the conduct of clinical trials, since monitoring activities typically consume 30% of the total costs for a trial.
 
TrialBuilder® is the tool our customers and professional services staff use to model a clinical study. This includes the data collection forms, the data consistency rules and the visit schedule, as well as the workflow and security rules for accessing and managing the data. TrialBuilder is a sophisticated multi-window application with a productive user interface that utilizes drag-and-drop functionality. 
 
TrialMaster Archive allows us to provide human and machine readable copies of the data when a clinical study has been completed. The human-readable format consists of PDF files that represent the data exactly as it was displayed on the interactive web pages.  These are delivered to the client via CD in a read-only format, affording our clients and the FDA the ability to review clinical trial data by trial, site, patient, visit and form. Trial sponsors receive a CD with data for all sites including final data exports in the formats their TrialMaster study used.   The TrialMaster Archive also includes an optional Submission Module, which creates a casebook containing PDF formatted copies of all case report forms (“CRF”) in FDA submission format.  This casebook is fully tabbed and bookmarked making it easy to find and view particular CRFs.

TrialOne Phase I EDC Software
 
TrialOne is a web-based application which provides secure real-time access to all study information, in particular trial sponsors and investigators are provided with information that allows for faster decision making.  Mid-study data provides trial sponsors with information useful in determining a drug’s safety and efficacy. More rapid access to clinical trial data will also allow trial sponsors to stop unsuccessful compounds sooner and to bring the successful therapies to market more quickly.
 
We believe the key benefits of TrialOne for our customers include:
 

● | Faster data collection, which provides the ability to get to database lock more quickly allowing for a more timely analysis of the study data;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability for clinical trial sponsors to reduce their total cost throughout the entire Phase I process by streamlining the patient recruitment process, reducing error rates through the use of edit queries and through the effective use of integration with medical instrumentation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Access to valid data earlier provides more visibility for “Go/No Go” decisions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increased trial subject safety-review data (e.g. vital sign trends) in real-time;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Trial sponsors can manage or run more studies with fewer human resources; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The use of bar-coded samples reduces laboratory errors thereby increasing patient safety.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TrialOne Phase I Application Suite
 
TrialOne is a comprehensive software application suite that provides clinical trial site sponsors, study investigators and study monitors with several tools designed to make the overall Phase I clinic operation more efficient.  Phase I studies are used to conduct the first tests of new drugs or medical devices in humans. They are often held in dedicated Phase I clinics, where volunteers follow a strict timed schedule of dosing followed by measurements such as vital signs, electrocardiograms and repeated blood draws. TrialOne is designed to manage the automation of Phase I clinics. It allows the specification of the schedule and the corresponding dosing and required measurements, then supports the real-time collection of data according to that schedule. Much of the data collection is automated via direct entry from instruments, such as barcode scanners that read barcodes on both the patients and the vials of blood being filled. 
 
The key components of the TrialOne application include:
 
Subject Recruitment and Screening
 The TrialOne subject recruitment module is designed to provide essential functionality for automating the collection and tracking of information involved in finding, screening and scheduling subject candidates for an early phase study.  The customized database can be searched for volunteers based on specific demographics, medical history and concomitant medications.  Trial sponsors can define study-specific screening test panels and record volunteer screening test results.  Outbound communications can be managed allowing for the scheduling of calls, sending e-mail blasts, printing mailing labels or exporting flexible CSV files.
Scheduler
 The scheduler module provides a mechanism for defining the study structure including a time and events schedule.  The module is designed to optimize study build times using a wizard-driven design tool creating database efficiencies using object libraries and templates.   This can quickly produce clear, easy to use, schedule driven electronic CRFs suitable for complex and adaptive clinical trials including study alarms and real time validation criteria with edits.  Additionally, the Scheduler can define actions or events to be automatically offset relative to the study drug and rapidly address mid-study changes.
Sample Tracking
 TrialOne allows customers to completely automate their site’s laboratory. Samples can be tracked and batched while alarms and information can be configured specific to each sample. Dispatch lists and labels are automatically produced for shipment of samples to the central laboratory. Data is then received back electronically into the TrialOne database.
Direct Data Capture (“DDC”)
 The DDC module allows capture of real-time data for screening or study at data collection stations, bed-side or roaming.  The system allows for the collection of data online, over an intranet or internet using a desktop, notebook, or tablet PC.  Using a library of custom drivers the DDC module can collect vital signs or other biologic data directly from devices and/or instrumentation.  As with later phase applications the system can clean data at the point of collection with real-time validation edit checks while enhancing protocol compliance via schedule-driven workflows.  Working with the Subject Recruitment and Screening module the system seamlessly maps data to the recruitment database for future criteria searches.  Automation and authentication checks are maintained using a full array of barcode and scanner support for all aspects of the clinic including subject IDs, sample labeling and event tracking.

Ad Hoc Reporting
 An integrated Ad Hoc reporting tool is available with wizard-driven report generation with drill-down reports that include interactive charts and graphs.  The Ad Hoc module supports aggregate data and advanced calculations, an advanced and easy to use export feature, and distributable system reports by configurable schedules.  Data is protected by event configurable security and role-based security.  The Ad Hoc module allows for real-time data access to important trends such as vital signs and adverse events.
 
 eClinical Suite
 
The eClinical Suite is comprised of a number of highly configurable modules that can be combined to provide a solution for capturing and managing clinical trial data based on specific client needs.  The modules are:
 

● | eClinical Portal – the gateway to all functions, data and reports. It provides the means to create an environment specific to any protocol and user needs.

Market Opportunity
 
Clinical trials are a critical component in bringing a drug or medical device to market.  All prescription drug and medical device therapies must undergo extensive testing as part of the regulatory approval process.  We believe many clinical trials continue to be conducted in an antiquated manner and fail to optimize the resources available for a successful clinical trial.  We believe that our solutions significantly reduce costs, improve data quality and expedite results.  We believe the data integrity, system reliability, management control and auditable quality of our eClinical solutions will aid clinical trial sponsors that want to improve clinical trial efficiencies, speed-up results and ensure regulatory compliance.

We believe that success in the EDC market is predicated on several criteria.  As the industry grows and matures the ability of participants to fulfill the varied needs of clinical trial sponsors becomes more critical to achieving operational and financial success.  We believe these success criteria include:
 

● | Deployment options. Successful EDC vendors provide clinical trial sponsors with flexibility in choosing whether to deploy EDC on an ASP, Technology Transfer or Technology Transition basis. The ultimate criteria for the selection of the type of technology delivery methodology is often predicated on the size and the resources of the clinical trial sponsor. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Interoperability. Most clinical trial sponsors have invested in other technology platforms to run their trials. These include clinical data management systems, interactive voice response systems and central labs. The ability for an eClinical solution to integrate with existing technology platforms is a key decision making factor. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Scalability. The ability to scale the eClinical solutions to absorb additional projects seamlessly is important to trial sponsors. Scalable solutions will retain their speed and performance metrics as projects and engagements increase in size. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Migration from hosted to technology transfer solutions. When clinical trial sponsors decide to bring the eClinical services and solutions in-house it is vital that they do not experience a degradation of speed, performance or system reliability. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Flexibility. The more robust eClinical systems will be designed to provide the ability to increase functionality and guarantee interoperability with other industry technology solutions. As the industry and technology matures clinical trial sponsors will demand new functionality without loss of performance or reliability. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Systematic adoption of best practices. eClinical vendors will be expected to assimilate best-practice workflows and process tools. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Professional services. The adoption and implementation of eClinical solutions into a clinical trial environment requires significant financial, technical and human resource investment on the part of clinical trial sponsors. A robust offering of professional services that fully integrate with the technological eClinical offerings will be considered an integral part of any eClinical purchase.

The Company spent $2,598,962 during the year ended December 31, 2016 and $2,639,577 during the year ended December 31, 2015 on product development initiatives. The Company’s product development efforts are focused on the continued enhancement and redesign of our eClinical Solutions to keep our technology at the cutting edge in the markets in which we compete.

Intellectual Property
 
Our success and ability to compete are dependent on our efforts to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology. We rely upon a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, non-competition and assignment of inventions agreements. We have registered trademarks and service marks in the United States and abroad, and have filed applications for the registration of additional trademarks and service marks. Our principal trademarks are “OmniComm Systems,” “TrialMaster,” “TrialBuilder,” “TrialExplorer,” “OmniCloud,” “Promasys” and “TrialOne.”  These legal protections afford only limited protection for our technology. Our agreements with employees, consultants and others who participate in development activities could be breached.  However, due to rapid technological change, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product and service developments and enhancements to existing products and services are more important than the various legal protections of our technology to establish and maintain a technology leadership position.
 
We currently hold several domain names, including the domain names “omnicomm.com,” “promasyssoftware.nl,” “promasyssoftware.com” and “trialmaster.com.” Additionally, legislative proposals have been made by the U.S. federal government that would afford broad protection to owners of databases of information. The protection of databases already exists in the European Union. The adoption of legislation protecting database owners could have a material adverse effect on our business, requiring us to develop additional, complex data protection features for our software products.
 
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our software solutions or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology. Any failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.
  
In addition, since the software and Internet-based industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights it also involves frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We, and other companies in our industry, have entered into a settlement and obtained a license from a patent holder (DataSci, LLC) to license third-party technology and other intellectual property rights that are incorporated into some elements of our services and solutions. Our technologies may not be able to withstand third-party claims or rights against their use. Any intellectual property claims against us, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle, could divert management attention from executing our business plan or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial position. There is no assurance that we will not become subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. An adverse determination on such a claim would increase our costs and could also prevent us from offering our technologies and services to others.

We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks, technology or copyrighted material, to third parties. We generally provide in our customer agreements that we will indemnify our customers against third-party infringement claims relating to our technology provided to the customer.
 
Competition
 
The market for EDC, data management and adverse event reporting systems is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, fragmented and is subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We compete with systems and paper-based processes utilized by existing or prospective customers, as well as other commercial vendors of EDC and eClinical applications, clinical data management systems and adverse event reporting software, including:

● | systems developed internally by existing or prospective customers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | vendors of EDC, eClinical, clinical trial management systems and adverse event reporting product suites, including Oracle Clinical a business unit of Oracle Corporation and Medidata Solutions; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | vendors of stand-alone EDC, data management and adverse event reporting products; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | CROs with internally developed EDC, clinical data management systems or adverse event reporting systems.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our ability to remain competitive will depend to a great extent upon our ongoing performance in the areas of product development, customer support and service delivery. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
 

● | product functionality and breadth of integration among the EDC, eClinical, clinical trial management systems and adverse event reporting solutions;

Government Regulation
 
The conduct of clinical trials is subject to regulation and regulatory guidance associated with the approval of new drugs, biological products and medical devices imposed upon the clinical trial process by the U.S. federal government and related regulatory authorities such as the FDA and by foreign governments. Use of our software products, services and hosted solutions by entities engaged in clinical trials must be done in a manner that is compliant with these regulations and regulatory guidance. Failure to do so could have an adverse impact on a clinical trial sponsor’s ability to obtain regulatory approval of new drugs, biological products or medical devices. If our product and service offerings fail to allow our customers and potential customers to operate in a manner that is compliant with applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, clinical trial sponsors and other entities conducting clinical research may be unwilling to use our software products, services and hosted solutions. Accordingly, we design our product and service offerings to allow our customers and potential customers to operate in a manner that is compliant with applicable regulations and regulatory guidance. We also expend considerable time and effort monitoring regulatory developments that could impact the use of our products and services by our customers and use this information in designing or modifying our product and service offerings.
 
The following is an overview of some of the regulations that our customers and potential customers are required to comply with in the conduct of clinical trials.
 
The clinical testing of drugs, biologics and medical devices is subject to regulation by the FDA and other governmental authorities worldwide. The use of software during the clinical trial process must adhere to the regulations and regulatory guidance known as Good Clinical Practices, other various codified FDA regulations, the Consolidated Guidance for Industry from the International Conference on Harmonization regarding Good Clinical Practice for Europe, Japan and the United States and other guidance documents. Our products, services and hosted solutions are developed using our domain expertise and are designed to allow compliance with applicable rules or regulations.
 
In addition to the aforementioned regulations and regulatory guidance, the FDA has developed regulations and regulatory guidance concerning electronic records and electronic signatures. The regulations, codified as 21 CFR Part 11, are interpreted for clinical trials in a guidance document titled Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Investigations. This regulatory guidance stipulates that computerized systems used to capture or manage clinical trial data must meet certain standards for attributability, accuracy, retrievability, completeness, originality, traceability, inspectability, validity, security and dependability. Other guidance documents have been issued that also help in the interpretation of 21 CFR Part 11.

Regulation of the use and disclosure of personal medical information is complex and growing. Federal legislation in the United States, known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes a number of requirements on the use and disclosure of "protected health information" which is individually identifiable, including standards for the use and disclosure by the health care facilities and providers who are involved in clinical trials. HIPAA also imposes on these healthcare facilities and providers standards to assure the confidentiality of health information stored or processed electronically, including a series of administrative, technical and physical security procedures. This may affect us in several ways. Many users of our products and services are directly regulated under HIPAA and, to the extent our products cannot be utilized in a manner that is consistent with the users' HIPAA compliance requirements, our products will likely not be selected. In addition, we may be directly affected by HIPAA and similar state, federal and foreign privacy laws. Under HIPAA, to the extent we perform functions or activities on behalf of customers that are directly regulated by such medical privacy laws, such customers may be required to obtain satisfactory assurance, in the form of a written agreement that we will comply with a number of the same HIPAA requirements.
