ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to HL Acquisitions Corp.
 
We are a British Virgin Islands business company incorporated on February 23, 2018 for the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation with, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, entering into contractual arrangements with, or engaging in any other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a “target business.” Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to focus our search for a target business in the hydrocarbon logistics and processing industries.
 
In March 2018, we issued an aggregate of 1,221,875 ordinary shares (“Founders’ Shares”) to Metropolitan Capital Partners V, LLC, an affiliate of Jeffrey E. Schwarz, our Chief Executive Officer, for aggregate consideration of $25,000 in cash, or approximately $0.02 per share, in connection with our organization. Metropolitan Capital Partners V, LLC then subsequently transferred certain of the Founders’ Shares to our other initial shareholders, officers and directors (collectively, the “initial shareholders”) for the same consideration originally paid for such shares. In June 2018, we effected a stock dividend of approximately 0.18 shares for each outstanding share, resulting in our initial shareholders holding an aggregate of 1,437,500 Founders’ Shares.  The Founders’ Shares included an aggregate of 187,500 shares that were subject to forfeiture if the underwriters’ over-allotment option was not exercised in full in our initial public offering (“IPO”).
 
On July 2, 2018, we consummated our IPO of 5,500,000 units, including 500,000 units which were subject to the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters of the IPO, with each unit consisting of one ordinary share, one right, and one redeemable warrant. Each right is exchangeable for one-tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share upon the consummation of our initial business combination. Each warrant will become exercisable on the later of the completion of an initial business combination or July 2, 2019 and will expire on the fifth anniversary of our completion of an initial business combination, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Commencing on July 18, 2018, the ordinary shares, rights, and warrants included in the units commenced separate trading. Holders now have the option to continue to hold units or separate their units into the component pieces. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $55,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement of 2,375,000 warrants (“Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $2,375,000. The Private Placement Warrants were purchased by certain of our initial shareholders. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the warrants included in the units sold in the IPO except that the Private Placement Warrants: (i) are not redeemable by us and (ii) are exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or any of their permitted transferees. Additionally, the purchasers of the Private Placement Warrants have agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination.

We paid a total of $1,375,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions at the closing of the IPO and $504,265 for other costs and expenses related to our formation and the IPO. After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the offering expenses, the total net proceeds to us from the IPO and simultaneous private placement were $55,495,735. Of these amounts, $55,000,000 was deposited into a trust account established in connection with the IPO, and the balance became available to be used to provide for business, legal, and accounting due diligence on prospective target businesses and continuing general and administrative expenses. We may withdraw from the trust account interest earned on the funds held therein necessary to pay our income taxes, if any. Other than for this exception, the funds in the trust account will not be released to us until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation upon our failure to consummate a business combination within the required time period as set forth in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.
