--------+---------

General 
 BSB Bancorp, Inc. (BSB Bancorp or the Company) is a Maryland corporation that owns 100% of the common stock of Belmont Savings Bank (Belmont Savings or the Bank) and BSB Funding Corporation. BSB Bancorp was incorporated in June, 2011 to become the holding company of Belmont Savings in connection with the Banks conversion from the mutual holding company to stock holding company form of organization (the conversion). On October 4, 2011 we completed our initial public offering of common stock in connection with the conversion, selling 8,993,000 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share for approximately $89.9 million in gross proceeds, including 458,643 shares sold to the Banks employee stock ownership plan. In addition, in connection with the conversion, we issued 179,860 shares of our common stock and contributed $200,000 in cash to the Belmont Savings Bank Foundation. At December 31, 2016, we had consolidated assets of $2.16 billion, consolidated deposits of $1.47 billion and consolidated equity of $160.92 million. Other than holding the common stock of Belmont Savings, BSB Bancorp has not engaged in any significant business to date. 
 Belmont Savings is a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank headquartered in Belmont, Massachusetts. The Banks business consists primarily of accepting deposits from the general public, small businesses and municipalities and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in one to four family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, multi-family real estate loans, home equity lines of credit, indirect automobile loans (automobile loans assigned to us by automobile dealerships), commercial business loans, construction loans and investment securities. To a much lesser extent, the Bank also makes other consumer loans and second mortgage loans. We offer a variety of deposit accounts, including relationship checking accounts for consumers and businesses, passbook and statement savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, Interest on Lawyer Trust Accounts (IOLTA), commercial, municipal and regular checking accounts and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). The Bank offers a wide range of commercial and retail banking services which include cash management, online and mobile banking and global payments. 
 Throughout its history, Belmont Savings has remained focused on providing a broad range of quality services within its market area as a community bank. In 2009, Belmont Savings reorganized into the mutual holding company structure. Further, following a comprehensive strategic review of the Banks management and operations, the board of directors of the Bank approved a new strategic plan designed to increase the growth and profitability of the Bank. The strategic plan was intended to take advantage of the sound Eastern Massachusetts economy, which was not as negatively affected by the recession that began in 2008 as other regions of the United States. The Banks current strategic plan contemplates continued growth in assets and liabilities over the next several years with the intent of building upon Belmont Savings leading market share in Belmont and growing share in the communities we serve, striving to be the Bank of Choice for deposit driven small businesses and municipalities in its market area. Additionally, we are striving to be the lender of choice for one to four family residential real estate loans and the trusted lending partner for area commercial real estate investors, developers and managers.

Market Area 
 We conduct our operations from our six full service branch offices located in Belmont, Watertown, Waltham, Newton and Cambridge in Southeast Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Our primary lending market includes Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk and Suffolk Counties, Massachusetts. Due to its proximity to Boston, our primary market area benefits from the presence of numerous institutions of higher learning, medical care and research centers and the corporate headquarters of several significant financial service companies. Eastern Massachusetts also has many high technology companies employing personnel with specialized skills. These factors affect the demand for residential homes, multi-family apartments, office buildings, shopping centers, industrial warehouses and other commercial properties. 
 Our lending area is primarily an urban market area with a substantial number of one to four unit properties, some of which are non-owner occupied, as well as apartment buildings, condominiums, office buildings and retail space. As a result, compared to many thrift institutions, our loan portfolio contains a significantly greater number of multi-family and commercial real estate loans. 
 Our market area is located largely in the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy, Massachusetts/New Hampshire Metropolitan Statistical Area. The United States Census Bureau estimates that as of July 1, 2015, the Boston metropolitan area is the 10th largest metropolitan area in the United States. Located adjacent to major transportation corridors, the Boston metropolitan area provides a highly diversified economic base, with major employment sectors ranging from services, manufacturing and wholesale/retail trade, to finance, technology and medical care. According to the United States Department of Labor, in December 2016, the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy, Massachusetts/New Hampshire MSA had an unemployment rate of 2.3% compared to the national unemployment rate of 4.7%. 
 Competition 
 We face intense competition in our market area both for making loans and attracting deposits. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings institutions, online banks, mortgage brokerage firms, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and investment banking firms. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting customers, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. 
 Our deposit sources are primarily from customers in the communities in which our offices are located, as well as from small businesses, municipalities and other customers from our lending areas. As of June 30, 2016 (the latest date for which information is publicly available from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), we ranked first of eleven bank and thrift institutions with offices in the town of Belmont, Massachusetts, with a 47.04% market share. As of that same date, we ranked fifth of eight bank and thrift institutions with offices in the city of Watertown, Massachusetts, with a 4.81% market share, eighth of ten bank and thrift institutions with offices in the city of Waltham, Massachusetts, with a 2.8% market share, thirteenth of fifteen bank and thrift institutions with offices in the city of Newton, Massachusetts, with a 0.9% market share, and thirteenth of sixteen bank and thrift institutions with offices in the city of Cambridge, with a 0.8% market share. 
 Lending Activities 
 Our primary lending activity is comprised of one to four family residential mortgage loans, multi-family real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, home equity lines of credit, indirect auto loans, commercial business loans and construction loans.

One-to-Four Family Residential Mortgage Loans. 
 At December 31, 2016, $997.3 million, or 53.34%, of our total loan portfolio, consisted of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. We offer fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans with maturities up to 30 years. 
 Much of the housing stock in our primary lending market area is comprised of one, two, three and four unit properties, all of which are classified as one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2016, of the $997.3 million of one to four family residential mortgage loans in our portfolio, $63.5 million, or 6.4%, were comprised of non-owner occupied properties. 
 Our one-to-four family residential mortgage loans are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as conforming loans. We generally originate and purchase both fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which is generally $417,000 (increased to $424,100 in 2017) for one-unit properties. We also originate and purchase loans above this amount, which are referred to as jumbo loans. We generally underwrite jumbo loans in a manner similar to conforming loans, and in adherence to Belmont Savings Banks Credit Policy. Jumbo loans are common in our market area. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we originated $78.8 million and purchased $307.8 million of jumbo loans. 
 We generally originate and purchase our adjustable rate one-to-four family residential mortgage loans with initial interest rate adjustment periods of one, three, five, seven and ten years, based on adding a margin to a designated market index. We determine whether a borrower qualifies for an adjustable rate mortgage loan annually based on secondary market guidelines. 
 We will originate and purchase one-to-four family residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 80% without private mortgage insurance. We will originate loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 95% with private mortgage insurance and where the borrowers debt service does not exceed 43% of the borrowers monthly cash flow.     
 Occasionally, we sell into the secondary market fixed rate one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. We base the amount of fixed rate loans that we sell into the secondary market on our liquidity needs, asset/liability mix, loan volume, portfolio size and other factors. We sell loans both servicing released and servicing retained. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we received servicing fees of $192,000 on loans that were previously sold. At December 31, 2016, the principal balance of loans serviced for others totaled $59.8 million. 
 We generally do not offer reverse mortgages, interest only mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties nor do we offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as Option ARM loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on his loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not offer subprime loans (loans that are made with low down payments to borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans (defined as loans having less than full documentation).     
 Commercial Real Estate and Multi-family Real Estate Loans. 
 At December 31, 2016, $491.8 million, or 26.31%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans and multi-family (which we consider to be five or more units) residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2016, substantially all of our commercial real estate and multi-family real estate loans were secured by properties located in Eastern Massachusetts. 
 Our commercial real estate mortgage loans are primarily secured by office buildings, owner-occupied commercial buildings, industrial buildings and strip mall centers. Our multi-family loans are primarily secured by five or more unit residential properties. At December 31, 2016, loans secured by commercial real estate and multi-family real estate had an average loan balance of $2.4 million.

We offer commercial and multi-family real estate loans at fixed and adjustable rates. Our commercial and multi-family real estate loans with adjustable rates generally have terms of ten years with fixed rates for the first five years and adjustable rates thereafter based on changes in a designated market index. These loans generally amortize on a twenty-five to thirty year basis, with a balloon payment due at maturity. 
 In underwriting commercial and multi-family real estate loans, we consider a number of factors, which include the net cash flow to the loans debt service requirement (generally requiring a minimum of 125%), the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower or guarantor and the borrowers and guarantors experience in owning or managing similar properties. Commercial and multi-family real estate loans are generally originated in amounts up to 80% of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property securing the loan, whichever is lower. Personal guarantees are typically obtained on these commercial real estate and multi-family real estate loans. In addition, the borrowers and guarantors financial information on such loans is monitored on an ongoing basis through required periodic financial statement updates. 
 Commercial and multi-family real estate loans generally carry higher interest rates and have shorter terms than one to four family residential mortgage loans. Commercial real estate and multi-family real estate loans, however, entail greater credit risks compared to the one to four family residential mortgage loans we originate as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial real estate and multi-family real estate than for one to four family residential properties. All commercial real estate loans, regardless of size, are approved by Senior Vice President-Credit Manager of Commercial Real Estate Lending, the Executive Vice President and Division Executive of Commercial Real Estate Lending and the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank. 
 At December 31, 2016, our largest commercial real estate loan had an outstanding balance of $18.5 million, was secured by two office buildings and one industrial building totaling 337,852 square feet, and was performing in accordance with its original terms. At that date, our largest multi-family real estate loan had a balance of $10.8 million, was secured by an 11 building residential complex with 102 units, and was performing in accordance with its original terms. 
 Home Equity Lines of Credit. At December 31, 2016, $167.5 million, or 8.96%, of our loan portfolio consisted of home equity lines of credit. In addition to traditional one to four family residential mortgage loans, we offer home equity lines of credit that are secured by the borrowers primary residence, secondary residence or one to four family investment properties. Home equity lines of credit are generally underwritten with the same criteria that we use to underwrite one to four family residential mortgage loans. 
 Our home equity lines of credit are revolving lines of credit which generally have a term of twenty five years, with draws available for the first ten years. Our twenty five year lines of credit are interest only during the first ten years, and amortize on a fifteen year basis thereafter. We generally originate home equity lines of credit with loan-to-value ratios of up to 80% when combined with the principal balance of the existing first mortgage loan, although loan-to-value ratios may occasionally exceed 80% on a case by case basis. Maximum loan-to-values are determined based on an applicants credit score, property value and debt-to-income ratio. Lines of credit above $1 million with loan-to-values greater than 60% require two full appraisals with the valuation being the average of the two. Rates are adjusted monthly based on changes in a designated market index. At December 31, 2016, our largest home equity line of credit was a $2.3 million line of credit and did not have an outstanding balance. At December 31, 2016 this line of credit was performing in accordance with its original terms.

Commercial Loans. We originate commercial term loans and variable lines of credit to small- and medium-sized businesses in our primary market area. Our commercial loans are generally used for working capital purposes or for acquiring equipment or real estate. These loans are generally secured by business assets, such as business equipment and inventory or accounts receivable, and real estate, and are generally originated with maximum loan-to-value ratios of up to 80%. The commercial business loans that we offer are generally adjustable-rate loans with terms ranging from three to five years. At December 31, 2016, we had $63.4 million of commercial business loans and lines of credit outstanding, representing 3.39% of our total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2016, the average loan balance of our commercial loans and lines of credit was $1.3 million. 
 When making commercial business loans, we consider the financial condition of the borrower, the payment history of the borrower, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business and the value of the collateral, if any. Virtually all of our loans are guaranteed by the principals of the borrower. 
 Commercial business loans generally have a greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrowers ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrowers ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrowers business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself. Further, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. We seek to minimize these risks through our underwriting standards and the experience of our credit department. The credit department is responsible for the underwriting and documentation of new commercial loans as well as the annual review of credit ratings of existing loans and special credit projects. The credit department has no loan production goals and has annual performance objectives based on credit quality and credit risk management. All commercial loans, regardless of size, are approved by the Senior Vice President-Credit Manager of Commercial Real Estate Lending, the Executive Vice President and Division Executive of Commercial Real Estate Lending and the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank. 
 At December 31, 2016, our largest commercial loan outstanding was a $21.8 million loan secured by five separate Class A suburban office properties with a combined total of 487,254 square feet of rentable space, on a combined 47 acres of property. At December 31, 2016, this loan was performing in accordance with its original terms. 
 Construction Loans. We originate loans to professional developers and investors to finance the construction of one-to-four family residential properties, multi-family properties and commercial properties. The majority of our construction loans are for commercial development projects, including residential properties. Most of our loans for the construction of one-to-four family residential properties are on speculation, meaning there is no buyer committed to purchase the completed residence. At December 31, 2016, $89.0 million, or 4.8%, of our total loan portfolio, consisted of construction loans, $16.2 million of which were secured by one-to-four family residential real estate projects on speculation, $26.9 million of which were secured by multi-family residential real estate projects, and $45.9 million of which were secured by land and commercial real estate including industrial development bonds. The Bank owns certain bonds issued by state agencies that it categorizes as loans. This categorization is made on the basis that another entity (i.e. the Banks customer), not the issuing agency, is responsible for the payment to the Bank of the principal and interest on the debt. Furthermore, credit underwriting is based solely on the credit of the customer (and guarantors, if any), the banking relationship is with the customer and not the agency, there is no active secondary market for the bonds, and the bonds are not available for sale, but are intended to be held by the Bank until maturity. At December 31, 2016, the balance of industrial development bonds was $14.0 million. These loans were secured by office property containing 60,250 feet of rentable area and fourteen one to four family residential properties. 
 Our construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is usually 12 to 24 months. At the end of the construction phase, depending upon the initial purpose, the loan either converts to a permanent mortgage loan or the project is sold. Loans generally are made with a maximum loan to cost ratio of 75%, or a maximum loan-to-as completed value ratio of 75%, whichever is lower. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. We also require satisfactory inspections of the property and a satisfactory title update before disbursements of funds during the term of the construction loan.

At December 31, 2016, our largest speculative construction loan had a principal balance of $13.4 million and was secured by a 1.24 acre site with a former office building being rehabilitated into 80 residential apartment units including 10 affordable units. At December 31, 2016, this loan was performing in accordance with its original terms. 
 Construction financing generally involves greater credit risk than the financing of improved cash flowing real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. Construction loans also expose us to the risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. In addition, the ultimate sale or rental of the property may not occur as anticipated. 
 Indirect Automobile Loans and Other Consumer Loans. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we began originating indirect automobile loans. These are automobile loans that franchised dealerships originate and assign to us, upon our approval, for a premium based on pre-established rates and terms. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our portfolio of indirect auto loans decreased from $104.0 million to $60.2 million, a decrease of 42.1% as we decided to suspend new originations due to market conditions during the second quarter of 2015. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2016, no indirect automobile loans were sold to other financial institutions. We expect that future sales of indirect auto loans will be driven by our risk management considerations, our liquidity needs, asset/liability mix, loan volume, portfolio size, market pricing and other factors. As of December 31, 2016, we maintained relationships with eighteen financial institutions to which we may sell indirect automobile loans. We sell our indirect automobile loans as non-recourse whole loans with servicing retained, and make standard representations and warranties in connection with the sale and servicing of the loans. We receive a fee from the loan purchaser at the time of sale, as well as servicing fees. Loans sold are generally representative of our indirect automobile portfolio. 
 To a lesser extent we also offer a variety of other consumer loans, primarily loans secured by savings deposits. At December 31, 2016, our portfolio of consumer loans other than indirect automobile loans totaled $439,000, or 0.02% of our total loan portfolio. 
 Indirect automobile loans and other consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities. 
 Consumer loans generally have greater risk compared to longer-term loans secured by improved, owner-occupied real estate, particularly consumer loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. As a result, consumer loan repayments are dependent on the borrowers continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, our consumer loan portfolio contains a substantial number of indirect automobile loans where we assume the risk that the automobile dealership administering the lending process complies with federal, state and local consumer protection laws. 
 Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Participations and Servicing. Residential one to four family loans that we originate are generally underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures, which incorporate standard underwriting guidelines, including those of Fannie Mae, to the extent applicable. We originate both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans. Our loan origination and sales activity may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment that typically results in decreased loan demand. Most of our one to four family residential mortgage loan originations are generated by our loan officers or referred by branch managers and employees located in our banking offices.

In recent years, in an effort to manage interest rate risk in what has been a relatively low interest rate environment, we have sold a portion of fixed-rate one to four family residential mortgage loans that we have originated or purchased. Some of these loans were sold with the servicing rights released. For loans sold with servicing rights retained, we provide the servicing for the loans on a per-loan fee basis. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2016, we received $32,000 in net servicing income on residential mortgage loans that we sold. At December 31, 2016, the principal balance of residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $59.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we received $318,000 in net servicing income on indirect auto loans that we sold. At December 31, 2016, the principal balance of indirect auto loans serviced for others totaled $28.2 million. 
 We generally sell our loans without recourse, except for customary representations and warranties provided in sales transactions. Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent borrowers, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans. We retain a portion of the interest paid by the borrower on the loans we service as consideration for our servicing activities. 
 From time to time, we will participate in loans with other banks. Whether we are the lead lender or not, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies. At December 31, 2016, we held $20.8 million of commercial real estate loans in our portfolio that were participation loans from other lenders and $75.4 million of commercial real estate and commercial construction loans were participated out to other lenders. 
 We also purchase whole loans from other banks and mortgage companies. In these cases, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased one-to-four family residential mortgage loans of $350.7 million, of whole loans, with both fixed and variable rates, from other banks and mortgage companies. 
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. 
Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our Board of Directors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrowers ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral that will secure the loan. To assess the borrowers ability to repay, we review the borrowers employment and credit history and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower. We require full documentation on all of our loan applications. 
 Our policies and loan approval limits are established by our Board of Directors. Aggregate lending relationships in amounts up to $1.0 million can be approved by designated individual officers or officers acting together with specific lending approval authority. Individual loans and commercial relationships of $1.0 million or greater require the approval of the Executive Committee. All commercial real estate and commercial loans, regardless of size, are approved by the Senior Vice President-Credit Manager of Commercial Real Estate Lending, the Executive Vice President and Division Executive of Commercial Real Estate Lending and the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank. 
 In accordance with governing banking statutes, the Bank is permitted, with certain exceptions, to make loans and commitments to any one borrower, including related entities, in the aggregate amount of not more than 20% of the Banks Tier 1 capital, or $31.2 million, at December 31, 2016, which is the Banks legal lending limit. There were no borrowers whose total indebtedness in aggregate exceeded the Banks legal lending limit. 
 We seek to minimize credit risks through our underwriting standards and the experience of our credit department. The credit department is responsible for the underwriting and documentation of new commercial loans as well as the annual review of credit ratings of existing loans and special credit projects. We consider our credit department to be independent because it has no loan production goals and has annual performance objectives based on credit quality and credit risk management. 
 
10 
 
We require appraisals based on a comparison with current market sales for all real property securing one to four family residential mortgage loans, multi-family loans and commercial real estate loans, unless the Executive Committee approves an alternative means of valuation. All appraisers are independent, state-licensed or state-certified appraisers and are approved by the Board of Directors annually. 
 Non-Performing and Problem Assets 
 When a residential mortgage loan or home equity line of credit is 15 days past due, a late payment notice is generated and mailed to the borrower. We will attempt personal, direct contact with the borrower to determine when payment will be made. We will send a letter when a loan is 30 days or more past due and will attempt to contact the borrower by telephone. Thereafter, we will send an additional letter when a loan is 60 days or more past due, and we will attempt to contact the borrower by telephone. By the 90th day of delinquency, unless the borrower has made arrangements to bring the loan current on its payments, the loan will be placed on non-accrual. We refer loans to legal counsel to commence foreclosure proceedings according to Massachusetts law. In addition, a property appraisal is made to determine the current condition and market value. The account will be monitored on a regular basis thereafter. In attempting to resolve a default on a residential mortgage loan, Belmont Savings Bank complies with all applicable Massachusetts laws regarding a borrowers right to cure. 
 When auto finance loans become 10 to 15 days past due, a late fee is charged according to applicable guidelines. When the loan is 11 days past due, the customer will receive a phone call from our servicer requesting a payment. Letters are generated at 20 and 25 days past due. A letter stating our intent to repossess the automobile goes to the customer 21 days prior to repossession, which is triggered at 45 days past due. Vehicles are assigned for repossession at 65 to 70 days past due; the customer has 21 days for right of redemption until the vehicle is sold. Auto loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and charged off at 120 days past due. 
 Commercial business loans, commercial real estate loans and consumer loans are generally handled in the same manner as residential mortgage loans or home equity lines of credit. All commercial business loans that are 60 days past due are immediately referred to a senior lending officer. Because of the nature of the collateral securing consumer loans, we may commence collection procedures faster for consumer loans than for residential mortgage loans or home equity lines of credit. 
 Loans are placed on non-accrual status when payment of principal or interest is more than 90 days delinquent. Loans are also placed on non-accrual status if collection of principal or interest in full is in doubt. When loans are placed on a non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received. The loan may be returned to accrual status if both principal and interest payments are brought current and remain current for six consecutive months and full payment of principal and interest is expected. All non-performing loans and problem assets are reviewed by the Executive Committee on a regular basis.

For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, gross interest income that would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms was $76,000 and $165,000, respectively. Interest income recognized on such loans for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, was $0 and $113,000, respectively. Loans remain on non-accrual until both principal and interest payments are brought current and remain current for six consecutive months and full payment of principal and interest is expected. As of December 31, 2016, $1.3 million in non-performing loans were paid current. 
 Troubled Debt Restructurings. We periodically modify loans to extend the term or make other concessions to help a borrower stay current on their loan and to avoid foreclosure. We generally do not forgive principal or interest on loans or modify the interest rates on loans to rates that are below market rates. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $6.1 million and $7.8 million, respectively, of troubled debt restructurings. At December 31, 2016, $2.5 million was related to six residential one-to-four family loans, $200,000 was related to one home equity line of credit and $3.4 million was related to three commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2015, $3.9 million was related to six residential one to four family loans, $200,000 was related to one home equity line of credit and $3.7 million was related to three commercial real estate loans. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, gross interest income that would have been recorded had our troubled debt restructurings been performing in accordance with their original terms was $119,000 and $290,000, respectively. Interest income recognized on such modified loans for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $201,000 and $283,000, respectively.

 Other Real Estate Owned. Real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned. When property is acquired it is recorded at estimated fair market value at the date of foreclosure less the cost to sell, establishing a new cost basis. Estimated fair value generally represents the sales price a buyer would be willing to pay on the basis of current market conditions, including normal terms from other financial institutions. Holding costs and declines in estimated fair market value result in charges to expense after acquisition. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 we did not have any property classified as other real estate owned. 
 Classification of Assets. Our policies, consistent with regulatory guidelines, provide for the classification of loans and other assets that are considered to be of lesser quality as substandard, doubtful, or loss assets. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those assets characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets (or portions of assets) classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted. Assets that do not expose us to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but which possess potential weaknesses that deserve our close attention, are required to be designated as special mention. 
 
15 
 
We maintain an allowance for loan losses at an amount estimated to equal all credit losses incurred in our loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at a balance sheet measurement date. Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our loss allowances is subject to review by regulatory agencies, which may require that we establish additional loss allowances. We regularly review our asset portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. 
 The following table sets forth our amounts of classified assets, assets designated as special mention and criticized assets (classified assets and loans designated as special mention) as of the dates indicated.

 At December 31, 2016, we had $7.6 million of substandard assets, of which $4.3 million were commercial real estate loans, $2.5 million were one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, and $799,000 was a home equity line of credit. At December 31, 2016, special mention assets consisted of $16.0 million of commercial real estate loans and $351,000 of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Other than disclosed in the above tables, there are no other loans at December 31, 2016 that management has serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms. 
 Potential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing and are not included in non-accrual loans above, but may be delinquent. These loans require an increased level of management attention, because we have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present loan repayment terms and as a result such loans may be included at a later date in non-accrual loans. At December 31, 2016, we had no potential problem loans that are not discussed above under Classification of Assets. 
 Allowance for Loan Losses 
 We provide for loan losses based upon the consistent application of our documented allowance for loan loss methodology. All loan losses are charged to the allowance for loan losses and all recoveries are credited to it. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are provided by charges to income based on various factors which, in our judgment, deserve current recognition in estimating probable losses. We regularly review the loan portfolio, including a review of our classified assets, and make provisions for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses in accordance with GAAP. The allowance for loan losses consists primarily of two components: 

(1) | specific allowances established for impaired loans (as defined by GAAP). The amount of impairment provided for as a specific allowance is measured based on the deficiency, if any, between the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate at the time of impairment or, as a practical expedient, at the loans observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral-dependent, and the carrying value of the loan; and
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | general allowances established for loan losses on a portfolio basis for loans that do not meet the definition of impaired loans. The portfolio is grouped into homogenous pools by similar risk characteristics, primarily by loan type and regulatory classification. We apply an estimated

incurred loss rate to each loan group. The loss rates applied are based upon our loss experience adjusted, as appropriate, for the environmental factors discussed below. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revisions based upon changes in economic and real estate market conditions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance for loan losses we have established, which could have a material negative effect on our financial results. 
 The adjustments to historical loss experience are based on our evaluation of several qualitative and environmental factors, including: 
 

 | changes in any concentration of credit (including, but not limited to, concentrations by geography, industry or collateral type);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | changes in the number and amount of non-accrual loans, watch list loans and past due loans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | changes in national, state and local economic trends;
--+------------------------------------------------------


 | changes in the types of loans in the loan portfolio;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


 | changes in the experience and ability of personnel and management in the loan origination and loan servicing departments;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | changes in lending strategies; and
--+-----------------------------------


 | changes in lending policies and procedures.
--+--------------------------------------------

 In addition, we may establish an unallocated allowance to provide for probable losses that have been incurred as of the reporting date but are not reflected in the allocated allowance. 
 We evaluate the allowance for loan losses based upon the combined total of the specific and general components. Generally when the loan portfolio increases, absent other factors, the allowance for loan loss methodology results in a higher dollar amount of estimated probable losses than would be the case without the increase. Generally when the loan portfolio decreases, absent other factors, the allowance for loan losses methodology results in a lower dollar amount of estimated probable losses than would be the case without the decrease. 
 We evaluate the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis and the allowance is adjusted accordingly. While we use the best information available to make evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the information used in making the evaluations. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, will periodically review the allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their analysis of information available to them at the time of their examination.

Investments 
 The Board of Directors has the responsibility for approving our investment policy, and it is the responsibility of management to implement specific investment strategies. The Executive Committee has authorized our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and our Senior Vice President, Director of External Reporting & Accounting Policy to execute specific investment actions. The investment policy requires that single day transactions in excess of $15.0 million must contain the signature of two authorized officers and a member of the Executive Committee. 
 
19 
 
The investment policy is reviewed and approved annually by the Board of Directors. The overall objectives of the investment policy are to: fully and efficiently employ funds not presently required for Belmont Savings Banks loan portfolio, cash requirements, or other assets essential to our operations; to provide for the safety of the funds invested while generating maximum income and capital appreciation in accordance with the objectives of liquidity and quality; to meet liquidity requirements projected by management; to meet regulatory and industry standards; to generate earnings which, after the impact of taxes, will provide added growth to surplus; and to employ a percentage of assets in a manner that will balance the market and credit risks of other assets, as well as our liquidity, capital, and reserve structure. All gains and losses on securities transactions are reported to the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. 
 Our current investment policy permits investments in securities issued by the U.S. government and U.S. government agencies, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, asset-backed securities (collateralized by assets other than conforming residential first mortgages), repurchase agreements, federal funds sold, certificates of deposit, money market funds, money market preferred securities, mutual funds, equity securities, daily overnight deposit funds, bankers acceptances, commercial paper, equity securities, structured notes, callable securities and any other investments that are deemed prudent and are approved by the Executive Committee and permitted by statute. 
 ASC 320, InvestmentsDebt and Equity Securities requires that, at the time of purchase, we designate a security as either held to maturity, available for sale, or trading, based upon our intent and ability to hold such security until maturity. Securities available for sale and trading securities are reported at market value and securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost. We currently do not maintain a trading portfolio. A periodic review and evaluation of the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios is conducted to determine if the fair value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such decline is other-than-temporary. For securities classified as available for sale, unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and are reported as an increase or decrease to stockholders equity through other comprehensive income/(loss). If such decline is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged against earnings or other comprehensive income/(loss). 
 Generally, mortgage-backed securities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans since there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our borrowings. Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. Current prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments. 
 Securities. At December 31, 2016, our securities portfolio consisted entirely of corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. At that date our securities portfolio had a fair value of $151.5 million and an amortized cost of $152.2 million. Total securities had a carrying value of $152.2 million, or 7.1% of total assets. At December 31, 2016, none of the underlying collateral consisted of subprime or Alt-A (traditionally defined as loans having less than full documentation) loans. We do not own any trust preferred securities or collateralized debt obligations. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsAverage Balances and Yields for a discussion of the recent performance of our securities portfolio. 
 At December 31, 2016, we had no investments in a single company or entity, other than U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, that had an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of our stockholders equity.

Bank-Owned Life Insurance. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to help defray the cost of our benefit plan obligations. Bank-owned life insurance also provides us noninterest income that is generally non-taxable. Applicable regulations generally limit our investment in bank-owned life insurance to 25% of our Tier 1 capital plus our allowance for loan losses. At December 31, 2016, we had $35.8 million in bank-owned life insurance. 
 Sources of Funds 
 General. Deposits traditionally have been our primary source of funds for our investment and lending activities. We also borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (the FHLB of Boston) to supplement cash flow needs, to lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk management purposes and to manage our cost of funds. Our additional sources of funds are scheduled payments and prepayments of principal and interest on loans and investment securities and fee income and proceeds from the sales of loans and securities. 
 Deposits. We accept deposits primarily from customers in the communities in which our offices are located, as well as from small businesses, municipalities and other customers throughout our lending area. We rely on our competitive pricing and products, convenient locations and quality customer service to attract and retain deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposit accounts consist of relationship checking for consumers and businesses, passbook and statement savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, IOLTA, commercial, municipal and regular checking accounts, and IRAs. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current business strategies and market interest rates, liquidity requirements and our deposit growth goals. We also access the brokered deposit market for funding. 
 At December 31, 2016, we had a total of $179.2 million in certificates of deposit, excluding brokered deposits, of which $91.7 million had remaining maturities of one year or less. Based on historical experience and our current pricing strategy, we believe we will retain a large portion of these accounts upon maturity. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had a total of $156.4 million and $114.0 million, respectively, of brokered certificates of deposit.

 On March 16, 2006, seventeen loans with an aggregate principal balance of $10.5 million were sold to another financial institution. The agreement related to this sale contained provisions requiring the Company to repurchase any loan that became 90 days past due during the initial 120 months. The Company would repurchase the past due loan for 100 percent of the unpaid principal plus interest to repurchase date. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the recourse provision expired and both the loans and recourse obligation were derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet. The Company did not incur any losses related to these loans. 
 Personnel 
 At December 31, 2016, the Bank had 119 full-time employees and 6 part-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management believes that we have a good working relationship with our employees. 
Subsidiaries 
 BSB Bancorp conducts its principal business activities through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Belmont Savings Bank. BSB Bancorp has one other wholly-owned subsidiary, BSB Funding Corporation, the sole purpose of which is to hold the loan to Belmont Savings Banks employee stock ownership plan. Belmont Savings has one subsidiary, BSB Investment Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation, which is engaged in the buying, selling and holding of investment securities.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION 
 General 
 Belmont Savings Bank is a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank and the wholly-owned subsidiary of BSB Bancorp, Inc. (BSB Bancorp), a Maryland corporation. Belmont Savings Banks deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, and by the Depositors Insurance Fund of Massachusetts for amounts in excess of the FDIC insurance limits. Belmont Savings Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, its primary federal regulator and deposit insurer. Belmont Savings Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the FDIC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. As a registered bank holding company, BSB Bancorp is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Reserve Board. 
 The regulatory and supervisory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance funds, rather than for the protection of stockholders and creditors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies concerning the establishment of deposit insurance assessment fees, classification of assets and establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the Massachusetts legislature, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of BSB Bancorp and Belmont Savings Bank. 
 Set forth below is a summary of certain material statutory and regulatory requirements that are applicable to Belmont Savings Bank and BSB Bancorp. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Belmont Savings Bank and BSB Bancorp. 
 Massachusetts Banking Laws and Supervision 
 General. As a Massachusetts-chartered stock savings bank, Belmont Savings Bank is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and to various Massachusetts statutes and regulations which govern, among other things, investment powers, lending and deposit-taking activities, borrowings, maintenance of surplus and reserve accounts, distribution of earnings and payment of dividends. In addition, Belmont Savings Bank is subject to Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights laws and regulations. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and/or the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation is required for a Massachusetts-chartered bank to establish or close branches, merge with other financial institutions, issue stock and undertake certain other activities. 
 Massachusetts regulations generally allow Massachusetts banks, with appropriate regulatory approvals, to engage in activities permissible for federally chartered banks or banks chartered by another state. The Commissioner also has adopted procedures reducing regulatory burdens and expense and expediting branching by well-capitalized and well-managed banks. 
 Recent Massachusetts banking legislation, An Act Modernizing the Banking Laws and Enhancing the Competitiveness of State-Chartered Banks, became effective in April 2015. Among other things, the legislation attempts to better synchronize Massachusetts laws with federal requirements in the same area, streamlines the process for an institution to engage in activities permissible for federally chartered and out of state institutions, consolidates corporate governance statutes and provides authority for the Commissioner to establish a tiered supervisory system for Massachusetts-chartered institutions based on factors such as asset size, capital level, balance sheet composition, examination rating, compliance and other factors deemed appropriate. 
 
27 
 
Dividends. A Massachusetts stock bank may declare cash dividends from net profits not more frequently than quarterly. Non-cash dividends may be declared at any time. No dividends may be declared, credited or paid if the banks capital stock is impaired. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years. Dividends from BSB Bancorp may depend, in part, upon receipt of dividends from Belmont Savings Bank. The payment of dividends from Belmont Savings Bank would be restricted by federal law if the payment of such dividends resulted in Belmont Savings Bank failing to meet regulatory capital requirements. 
 Lending Activities in General. A Massachusetts bank may, in accordance with Massachusetts law and regulations issued by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, exercise any power and engage in any activity that has been authorized for national banks, federal thrifts or state banks in a state other than Massachusetts, provided that the activity is permissible under applicable federal and not specifically prohibited by Massachusetts law. Such powers and activities must be subject to the same limitations and restrictions imposed on the national bank, federal thrift or out-of-state bank that exercised the power or activity. Beginning in April 2015, a Massachusetts bank must provide the Commissioner of Banks advance written notice prior to engaging in certain activities permissible for national banks, federal thrifts, or out-of-state banks. 
 Loans to One Borrower Limitations. Massachusetts banking law grants broad lending authority. However, with certain limited exceptions, total obligations to one borrower may not exceed 20 percent of the total of the banks Tier 1 capital. 
 Investment Activities. In general, Massachusetts-chartered savings banks may invest in preferred and common stock of any corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state provided such investments do not involve control of any corporation and do not, in the aggregate, exceed 4% of the banks deposits. Federal law imposes additional restrictions on Belmont Savings Banks investment activities. See Federal RegulationsBusiness and Investment Activities. 
 Regulatory Enforcement Authority. Any Massachusetts savings bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies and directives of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may be subject to sanctions for non-compliance, including revocation of its charter. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated the law, conducted the banks business in an unsafe or unsound manner or contrary to the depositors interests or been negligent in the performance of their duties. Upon finding that a bank has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the bank concerned. The Commissioner also has authority to take possession of a bank and appoint a liquidating agent under certain conditions such as an unsafe and unsound condition to transact business, the conduct of business in an unsafe or unauthorized manner of impaired capital. In addition, Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights statutes applicable to Belmont Savings Bank permit private individual and class action law suits and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damage and attorneys fees in the case of certain violations of those statutes. 
 Depositors Insurance Fund. All Massachusetts-chartered savings banks are required to be members of the Depositors Insurance Fund, a corporation that insures savings bank deposits in excess of federal deposit insurance coverage. The Depositors Insurance Fund is authorized to charge savings banks an annual assessment fee on deposit balances in excess of amounts insured by the FDIC. Assessment rates are based on the institutions risk category, similar to the method currently used to determine assessments by the FDIC discussed below under Federal RegulationsInsurance of Deposit Accounts. 
 Protection of Personal Information. Massachusetts has adopted regulatory requirements intended to protect personal information. These requirements, which became effective March 1, 2010, are similar to existing federal laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, discussed below under Federal RegulationsPrivacy Regulations, that require organizations to establish written information security programs to prevent identity theft. The Massachusetts regulation also contains technology system requirements, especially for the encryption of personal information sent over wireless or public networks or stored on portable devices. 
 
28 
 
Massachusetts has other statutes or regulations that are similar to certain of the federal provisions discussed below. 
 Federal Regulations 
 Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. Federal law establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. The regulations were amended to incorporate increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015 (discussed below). Banks are placed in one of the following five categories based on the banks capital: 

 | well-capitalized (at least 5% leverage capital, 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% total risk-based capital and 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | adequately capitalized (at least 4% leverage capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% total risk-based capital and 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | undercapitalized (less than 4% leverage capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% total risk-based capital or 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | significantly undercapitalized (less than 3% leverage capital, 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 6% total risk-based capital or 3% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | critically undercapitalized (less than 2% tangible capital).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 Undercapitalized banks must adhere to growth, capital distribution (including dividend) and other limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. A banks compliance with such a plan must be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the institutions total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an undercapitalized bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional measures, including, but not limited to, a required sale of sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, a requirement to reduce total assets, cessation of taking deposits from correspondent banks, the dismissal of directors or officers and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status. 
 At December 31, 2016, Belmont Savings Bank met the criteria for being considered well-capitalized. 
 Capital Requirements. Under the FDICs regulations, federally insured state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System (state non-member banks), such as Belmont Savings Bank, are required to comply with minimum leverage capital requirements. Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8%, and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio of 4%. These capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015. In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual 
 
29 
 
 interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. In assessing an institutions capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions if it deems necessary. 
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement safety and soundness standards. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits and, more recently, safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. 
 Business and Investment Activities. Under federal law, all state-chartered FDIC-insured banks, including savings banks, have been limited in their activities as principal and in their equity investments to the type and the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law. Federal law permits exceptions to these limitations. For example, certain state-chartered savings banks may, with FDIC approval, continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange and in the shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The maximum permissible investment is the lesser of 100.0% of Tier 1 capital or the maximum amount permitted by Massachusetts law. Belmont Savings Bank received approval from the FDIC to retain and acquire such equity instruments up to the specified limits. However, at December 31, 2016, Belmont Savings Bank held no such investments. Any such grandfathered authority may be terminated upon the FDICs determination that such investments pose a safety and soundness risk or upon the occurrence of certain events such as the savings banks conversion to a different charter. 
 The FDIC is also authorized to permit state banks to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if they meet all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC has adopted regulations governing the procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 specified that a state bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a financial subsidiary, if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes. 
 Transactions with Affiliates. Transactions between a bank (and, generally, its subsidiaries) and its related parties or affiliates are limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to 10% of such institutions capital stock and surplus and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such institutions capital stock and surplus. The term covered transaction includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and similar transactions. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with specified requirements. The law also requires that affiliate transactions be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution, as those provided to non-affiliates.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by a company to its executive officers and directors. The law contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws, assuming such loans are also permitted under the law of the institutions chartering state. Under such laws, a banks authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders (insiders), as well as entities such persons control, is restricted. The law limits both the individual and aggregate amount of loans that may be made to insiders based, in part, on the banks capital position 
 
30 
 
 and requires certain board approval procedures to be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. Loans to executive officers are further limited to loans of specific types and amounts. 
 Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured state savings banks, including Belmont Savings Bank. That enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. The FDIC also has authority under federal law to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured bank under certain circumstances. The FDIC is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if that bank was critically undercapitalized on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became critically undercapitalized. 
 Federal Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Deposit accounts in Belmont Savings Bank are insured by the FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor, pursuant to changes made permanent by the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC assesses insured depository institutions to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of its deposit insurance assessment. 
 Under the FDICs risk-based assessment system, insured institutions of less than $10 billion of assets are assessed based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical models that estimate the probability of a banks failure within three years. That represents a change, effective July 1, 2016, from the previous system of assigning institutions to risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and other factors. An institutions assessment rate depends upon its rating and certain adjustments specified by the FDIC, with institutions deemed less risky paying lower assessments. 
 On February 7, 2011, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC published a final rule to revise the method of assessing its deposit insurance premiums. The rule, which took effect April 1, 2011, changed the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments from deposits to total assets less tangible (Tier 1) capital. The range of assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) for institutions of less than $10 billion in assets is currently 1.5 to 30 basis points of the assessment base. The current range took effect July 1, 2016 and represents a reduction in the prior range resulting from the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio reaching 1.15% of estimated insured deposits. 
 In addition to FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (FICO) is authorized to impose and collect, through the FDIC, assessments for costs related to bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. During the calendar year ended December 31, 2016, Belmont Savings Bank paid $97,000 in fees related to the FICO. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are required to fund the increase and, effective July 1, 2016, such institutions are paying a surcharge toward that end. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC. The FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long range fund ratio of 2%. 
 A material increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Belmont Savings Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of Belmont Savings Banks deposit insurance. 
 
31 
 
As a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank, Belmont Savings Bank is also required to be a member of the Depositors Insurance Fund, a corporation that insures savings bank deposits in excess of federal deposit insurance coverage. See Massachusetts Banking Laws and SupervisionDepositors Insurance Fund, above. 
 Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), a bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institutions discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA does require the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the institutions record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to establish or acquire branches and merge with other depository institutions. The CRA requires the FDIC to provide a written evaluation of an institutions CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. Belmont Savings Banks latest FDIC CRA rating, dated January 27, 2014, was satisfactory. 
 Massachusetts has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA which is also applicable to Belmont Savings Bank. The Massachusetts version is generally similar to the CRA but utilizes a five-tiered descriptive rating system. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required to consider a banks record of performance under the Massachusetts law in considering any application by the bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution. Belmont Savings Banks most recent rating under Massachusetts law, dated January 27, 2014, was satisfactory. 
 Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Board regulations require savings institutions to maintain non-interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) and regular checking accounts). The regulations currently provide that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: a 3% reserve ratio is assessed on net transaction accounts up to and including $115.1 million; a 10% reserve ratio is applied above $115.1 million. The first $15.5 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements. The amounts are adjusted annually. Belmont Savings Bank complies with the foregoing requirements. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. Belmont Savings Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of twelve regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, Belmont Savings Bank is required to acquire and hold a specified amount of shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. As of December 31, 2016, Belmont Savings Bank was in compliance with this requirement. 
 The Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston suspended its dividend payment for the first quarter of 2009 and did not pay a dividend through 2010. The Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston has paid dividends since then that are considerably less than those paid by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston prior to 2009. 
 Other Regulations 
 Some interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Belmont Savings Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Belmont Savings Banks operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions and other operations, including but not limited to, the: 

 | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring that borrowers for mortgage loans for one to four family residential real estate receive various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender servicing and escrow account practices, and prohibiting certain practices that increase the cost of settlement services;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
32 
 

 | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed, or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The operations of Belmont Savings Bank also are subject to the: 
 

 | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, that govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act privacy statute which requires each depository institution to disclose its privacy policy, identify parties with whom certain nonpublic customer information is shared and provide customers with certain rights to opt out of disclosure to certain third parties; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Title III of The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (referred to as the USA PATRIOT Act), which significantly expanded the responsibilities of financial institutions, in preventing the use of the United States financial system to fund terrorist activities. Among other things, the USA PATRIOT Act and the related regulations required banks operating in the United States to develop anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to facilitate the detection and reporting of money laundering.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Holding Company Regulation 
 BSB Bancorp, as a bank holding company, is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. BSB Bancorp is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval would be required for BSB Bancorp to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. 
 A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring, direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing securities brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property under certain conditions; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings association. 
 
33 
 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorizes a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including depository institutions subsidiaries that are well capitalized and well managed, to opt to become a financial holding company. A financial holding company may engage in a broader array of financial activities than permitted a typical bank holding company. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking. BSB Bancorp has not opted for financial holding company status up to this time. 
 BSB Bancorp is subject to the Federal Reserve Boards consolidated capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies. Traditionally, those guidelines have been structured similarly to the regulatory capital requirements for the subsidiary depository institutions, but were somewhat more lenient. For example, the holding company capital requirements allowed inclusion of certain instruments in Tier 1 capital that are not includable at the institution level. The Dodd-Frank Act directed the Federal Reserve Board to issue consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are not less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implements the Dodd-Frank Act as to bank holding company capital standards. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to banks were applied to bank holding companies (with greater than $1.0 billion of assets) as of January 1, 2015. As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer is being phased in through 2019. 
 A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the companys consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted an exception to that approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine. That longstanding policy of the Federal Reserve Board requires bank holding companies to serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organizations capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to dividends in certain circumstances such as where the companys net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the companys overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the companys capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also provides for regulatory consultation prior to a holding company redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction as of the end of a quarter in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the BSB Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends, repurchase shares of its stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, makes depository institutions liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the insurance fund in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default. That law would have potential applicability if BSB Bancorp ever held as a separate subsidiary a depository institution in addition to Belmont Savings Bank. 
 BSB Bancorp and Belmont Savings Bank will be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of various agencies of the United States Government, including the Federal Reserve System. In view of changing conditions in

 the national economy and in the money markets, it is impossible for management to accurately predict future changes in monetary policy or the effect of such changes on the business or financial condition of BSB Bancorp or Belmont Savings Bank. 
 The status of BSB Bancorp as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act will not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws. 
 Change in Control Regulations. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a bank holding company such as BSB Bancorp, Inc. unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institutions directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power to direct, or directly or indirectly to exercise a controlling influence over, the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a savings and loan holding companys voting stock constitutes a rebuttable determination of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, as will be the case with BSB Bancorp, Inc., the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 Massachusetts Holding Company Regulation. Under Massachusetts banking laws, a company owning or controlling two or more banking institutions, including a savings bank, is regulated as a bank holding company. Each Massachusetts bank holding company: (i) must obtain the approval of the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation before engaging in certain transactions, such as the acquisition of more than 5% of the voting stock of another banking institution; (ii) must register, and file reports, with the Massachusetts Division of Banks; and (iii) is subject to examination by the Division of Banks. BSB Bancorp would become a Massachusetts bank holding company if it acquires a second banking institution and holds and operates it separately from Belmont Savings Bank. 
Federal Securities Laws 
 BSB Bancorps common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. BSB Bancorp is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
