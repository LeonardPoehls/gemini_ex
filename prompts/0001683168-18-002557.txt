Item 1. Business.
1.a.) General Development of Business
 
Chineseinvestors.com, Inc. 
 
Chineseinvestors.com was incorporated on January 6, 1997 in the State of Indiana under the corporate name “MAS Acquisition LII Corp.” Prior to June 12, 2000, the Company was a ‘blank check’ company seeking a business combination with an unidentified business.
 
On June 12, 2000, we acquired 8,200,000 shares of common stock, representing 100% of the outstanding shares of Chineseinvestors.com, Inc., which was incorporated in the State of California on June 15, 1999. In connection with this acquisition, Aaron Tsai, our former sole officer and director, was replaced by Chineseinvestors.com, Inc.’s officers and directors.
 
The stockholders of Chineseinvestors.com, Inc. were issued 8,200,000 shares of our common stock, or approximately 96% of our total outstanding common shares. After giving effect to the acquisition, Chineseinvestors.com, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary and we changed our name to Chineseinvestors.com, Inc. Immediately prior to the acquisition of Chineseinvestors.com, Inc., MAS Capital Inc. returned 8,200,000 shares of common stock for cancellation without any consideration.
 
Chineseinvestors.com, Inc. was established as an ‘in language’ (Chinese) financial information web portal, offering various levels of information relative to the US Equity and Financial Markets, as well as certain other specific financial markets (including China A Shares, FOREX, etc.). Over the years, various informational components have been added and the general content improved as the Company continues to derive a material portion of its income from various subscription services it offers to its customers. We offer subscription services to provide education about investing and news and analysis on the stock market as well as news about particular stocks that we are following. Nevertheless, we do not provide our subscribers with individualized investment advice and never have investment discretion over any subscribers’ or site visitors’ funds. As described below, providing investor relations services for other companies, especially those requiring Mandarin language support, now account for our most significant revenue sources.
 
The registrant’s investor relations agreements typically obligate the registrant to provide translations of the client’s releases into English from Mandarin or from English into Mandarin, to feature advertisements about the client on the www.chinesefn.com website, and otherwise to assist the client in achieving its goals, which may be increasing the client’s stock price, increasing awareness of the clients and its stock or helping the client to move from pink sheets to an established public securities market. Not all of those goals are shared by every client. Promotions geared to the Chinese American market is the underlying common thread, generally in the form of advertisements on the chinesefn.com website. The registrant provides other services intended to increase awareness and knowledge of its clients’ businesses and stock within the Chinese American community.

The registrant generally receives a fee consisting of cash and the client’s securities for its services. The securities clearly offer success incentives and align the interests of the registrant and the client.
 
Chineseinvestors.com, Inc. has been in continuous operation since July 1999 using the web domains (uniform resource locators) of www.chineseinvestors.com and www.chinesefn.com.
 
We established a Representative Office business presence in leased office space in Shanghai, China in late 2000 from which we fulfill most of our support types of service and also have a leased office presence in San Gabriel, California, New York City, NY and Flushing, NY.
 
In 2010, the Company filed a Form 10 registration statement for us to become a public reporting company under the Exchange Act of 1934 in order to facilitate the Company’s ability to raise capital on the public market. In particular, we have retained the firm of B F Borgers CPA PC to be our independent auditor.
 
We selected Glendale Securities who has offices in Sherman Oaks, California as the market maker for our common stock, the price of which is quoted on the OTC:QB marketplace.
 
As of May 2018, the Company employed twenty-four (24) people in its Shanghai Office in a variety of administrative and operational capacities. All are employed full time.

In March 2017, the Company made a $250,000 investment in Breakwater MB, LLC, a cannabis-focused investment and consulting company, formed by Paul Dickman, the CFO and board member of ChineseInvestors.com, Inc., as a mean to invest capital in and provide consulting services to private, cannabis-focused companies as they transition into the public market. The invested capital will primarily be used to cover the costs of becoming a publicly traded company, a strategy the Company expects will provide significant investment appreciation and opportunity for liquidity. All opportunities will be evaluated by the investment committee comprised of ChineseInvestors.com, Inc.’s CEO Warren Wang, Medicine Man Technologies CEO Andy Williams, and Paul Dickman. Mr. Dickman is the managing member of Breakwater MB, LLC and Warren Wang serves as an advisor receiving no compensation for his services.
 
Breakwater MB, LLC completed its planned raise of $1,000,000 for 50% of Breakwater’s equity by December 2017. The Company’s equity position in Breakwater MB, LLC currently stands at 12.5% as of May 31, 2018.

The Company accounts for the investment under the equity method.
 
In 2017, in an effort to expand its media products, as the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 came to a close, the Company announced that it would be working with Wall Street Multimedia (“WSM”), an independent news agency located at the NYSE to produce a daily cryptocurrency video newscast in Chinese, intended to provide information and analysis regarding the digital crypto- world, including specific cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, industry trends, price movement, blockchain technology, sector-related stocks and ETFs, etc. The Company has begun airing its cryptocurrency video newscasts.

1.c.) General Company Information.
 
Market and Market Prospects
 
A significant market focus of the Company is on the segment of the Chinese population (both in the US and abroad) that does not have English language reading and or speaking skills but who wish to participate in the various financial markets that typically do not offer real time Chinese language information from an investment and/or general information perspective. With the emergence of a Chinese middle class as well as those who have had wealth transferred to them, there appears to be a continuing expansion of interest by the Chinese public in the general financial and securities marketplace as a whole.
 
In addition, the Company continues to provide various additional service initiatives including 1) offering consulting services, 2) offering various investor and public relation services, and 3) high quality information. The Company continues to build its current client base with regard to content services.

The Company has worked toward establishing its web presence, but due to the lack of site use information in competitor companies, and based upon our website access metrics, the Company must acknowledge that while it has a substantial public audience potential, it is difficult to ascertain exactly where any specific leadership position lies; therefore, the Company can make no definitive statement as to an overall position of its website and presence within its specific marketplace.

We receive subscription fees at the beginning of the subscribers’ subscription periods noting that the related revenue is deferred over the specific subscription period(s).

These courses will range in content providing basic knowledge and practical trading skills. They will be coupled with training in the use of digitalized, randomized, and quantified analyses for stock trading analysis and trading; helping the participants to be more skillful in practical trading as they progress through the course work.

GENERAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING A CRYPTOCURRENCY BUSINESS 
 
The Company may rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from or software licensed from third parties to facilitate the Company’s cryptocurrency related businesses including its planned domestic cryptocurrency ATM Network. 
 
Any damage to, or failure of these third party systems generally could result in interruptions in the Company’s services. Such interruptions may cause end-users to terminate use of the Company’s services. The Company will be harmed if others believe its services are unreliable.
 
Hardware, software, data and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
 
Any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase the Company’s expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of its services until equivalent technology is either developed or, if available, is identified and obtained through purchase or license and thereafter integrated into the Company’s services. If the Company were to experience significant strains on its data capacity, customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may harm its business.
 
Industry-specific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving, and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm the Company’s cryptocurrency related business endeavors.
 
Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding services such as those to be provided by the Company. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit the Company’s customers’ use and adoption of the Company’s products and services. Compliance with these regulations may also require it to devote greater resources to support certain adopters and end-users that the Company may not have or the ability to acquire.
 
Further, in some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to the Company if it is deemed to be a regulated securities business in the United States such as a broker-dealer or investment adviser under state and federal law. The interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations, and rulings is evolving in the courts and among regulators, and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and results. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business.
 
If the Company is unable to scale its operations and increase productivity, the Company may not be able to successfully implement its business plan.
 
The Company’s success will depend in part upon the ability of the Company’s senior management to manage its projected growth of the cryptocurrency division. To do so, the Company must continue to increase the productivity of its existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of the Company’s operations and personnel, it will need to continue to improve operational, financial and management controls, its reporting systems and procedures, and compliance with the laws and regulations in which it transacts business. If the Company fails to successfully scale its operations and increase productivity, the Company may be unable to execute its business plan.
 
The Company’s operating results are likely to fluctuate.
 
Important factors that may cause the Company’s revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate include: the Company’s ability to retain and increase users of its products and services and satisfy their requirements; the Company’s ability to retain and increase users of the products services and satisfy their requirements; the Company’s ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisitions or investments; general economic conditions, which may adversely affect usage rates; variations in the revenue mix of the Company’s services and respective growth rates; general economic conditions, which may adversely affect usage rates; changes in terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or because of competition; changes in payment methods, terms and the timing of such payments, including the use or obsolescence of digital currency media; changes in foreign currency or cryptocurrency exchange rates; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of the Company’s business; expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; income tax effects, including the impact of changes in USA federal and state and international tax laws applicable to the Company’s business and use of blockchain-related media for payment; technical difficulties or interruptions in the Company’s services; and regulatory compliance costs. Many of these factors are outside of the Company’s control.

The Company may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights.
 
The Internet and financial services industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. While the Company has not been the subject of such actions, we may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. The Company’s technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third-party or it may be required to pay damages, or both. The outcome of any such claims or litigation should they occur, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing the Company’s business plan, result in efforts to enjoin the Company’s activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require the Company to change its technology, change the Company’s business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements.
 
Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent the Company that from offering its services to others could adversely affect the Company
 
Any failure in the Company’s delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect its relationships with customers and financial results.
 
Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that the Company does not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect the Company’s reputation and its business.
 
The Services may not be widely adopted and may have limited users.
 
It is possible that the Company’s cryptocurrency products and services will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies and other entities or that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of the products and services. Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of the products and services relative to the Company’s cryptocurrency division.
 
Alternative networks may be established that compete with or are more widely used than the Company’s.
 
It is possible that alternative products and service offerings could be established to facilitate services that are materially similar to those offered by the Company’s cryptocurrency division. The Company may be unable to compete with these alternative service providers.
 
The regulatory regime governing the blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, tokens and token offerings is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Company’s cryptocurrency related businesses.
 
Regulation of blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, tokens and token offerings tokens is likely to rapidly evolve, varies significantly among international, federal, state and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive bodies in the United States and in other countries may in the future, adopt laws, regulations, guidance, or other actions, which may severely impact the development and growth of the Company’s cryptocurrency related businesses. Failure by the Company or certain users of its services to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines, all of which may affect the operations of the Company’s cryptocurrency related businesses.

As blockchain networks and blockchain assets have grown in popularity and in market size, federal and state agencies in the United States have begun to take interest in, and in some cases regulate, their use and operation.
 
The regulatory responses to emerging technologies, and to blockchain in particular in the US vary. The U.S. federal government has not exercised its constitutional preemptive power to regulate blockchain to the exclusion of states or even expressed intention to do so, regardless of the interest of federal agencies and so the states remain free to introduce their own rules and regulations. As an example, in 2015 New York became the first state in the U.S. to regulate virtual currency companies through state agency rulemaking. Initially, the Company intends to offer certain products and services in California, including a network of cryptocurrency ATMs, with plans to expand to other states. To date, California has failed at its attempts at creating a license, through a “Digital Currency Business Enrollment Program,” to conduct business related to “digital currency” within the state. Other states, such as Texas, have published guidance on how their existing regulatory regimes apply to virtual currencies. Some states, like New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Washington, have amended their statutes and regulations to include virtual currencies into existing securities regulation regimes. As such, there can be no assurances that the current regulatory framework, will continue in effect in states where the Company may conduct business for as long as the Company exists, or that other states will adopt or implement favorable regulation or legislation that may facilitate the utilization of the Company’s cryptocurrency products/services in the United States. Treatment of virtual currencies continues to evolve under the federal law of the United States as well. The United States Department of the Treasury, the United States Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), for example, have published guidance on the treatment of virtual currencies, tokens an instruments similar to tokens. Self-regulatory organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and the National Futures Association (“NFA”) have also issued such guidance. The United States Internal Revenue Service has released guidance treating virtual currency as property that is not currency for United States federal income tax purposes, although there is no indication yet whether other United States courts or federal or state regulators will follow this classification. Both United States federal and state agencies in the United States have instituted enforcement actions against those violating their interpretation of existing laws. The Company may not be able to implement or provide access to some of its cryptocurrency products and services, for example, its planned cryptocurrency ATM Network, in certain areas in the United States, if at all, due to changes in such laws and regulations. Further, the regulation of non-currency use of blockchain assets is also uncertain. The CFTC has publicly taken the position that certain blockchain assets are commodities, and the SEC has issued a public report stating United States federal securities laws require treating some blockchain assets as securities. To the extent that a domestic government or quasi-governmental agency in the United States exerts regulatory authority over a blockchain network or asset, the Company may be materially and adversely affected.
 
Blockchain networks also face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many foreign jurisdictions such as the European Union, China and Russia. 
 
Various foreign jurisdictions may in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the Company. Such laws, regulations or directives may conflict with those of the United States and other countries and may directly and negatively impact the Company’s business. The effect of any future regulatory changes is impossible to predict, but such changes could be substantial and materially adverse to the development and growth of the Company.
 
If the Company is unable to satisfy data protection, security, privacy, and other government and industry specific requirements, its growth may be impaired.
 
To the extent not previously discussed, there are several data protection, security, privacy and other government- and industry-specific requirements, including those that require companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. Security compromises could harm the Company’s reputation, erode user confidence in the effectiveness of its security measures, negatively impact its ability to attract new users, or cause existing users to stop using the Company’s products and services.
 
The further development and acceptance of blockchain networks which are a part of a new and rapidly changing industry are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate.
 
The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of blockchain networks and blockchain assets would have an adverse material effect on the successful development of the Company’s cryptocurrency division.

The growth of the blockchain industry in general, and its volatility. 
 
The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of digital assets could materially and adversely affect our business. The prices of blockchain assets such as Bitcoin have historically been subject to dramatic fluctuations and are highly volatile. Several factors may influence the market demand for the Company’s cryptocurrency products and services including, but not limited to: Global blockchain asset supply; Global blockchain asset demand, which can be influenced by the growth of retail merchants' and commercial businesses' acceptance of blockchain assets like cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services, the security of online blockchain asset exchanges and digital wallets that hold blockchain assets, the perception that the use and holding of blockchain assets is safe and secure, and the regulatory restrictions on their use; Currency exchange rates, including the rates at which digital assets may be exchanged for fiat currencies; Fiat currency withdrawal and deposit policies of blockchain asset exchanges and liquidity on such exchanges; Interruptions in service from or failures of major blockchain asset exchanges; Monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations; Regulatory measures, if any, that affect the use of blockchain assets; Global or regional political, or economic or financial events and situations. A decrease in the price of a single blockchain assets may cause volatility in the entire blockchain asset industry and may affect other blockchain assets. For example, a security breach that affects investor or user confidence in Bitcoin may affect the industry as a whole and may also cause the price of other blockchain assets to fluctuate.

Plan
 
As the US appears to be moving closer to Hemp Legalization, the Company intends to continue to invest into the operations of ChineseHempOil.com, Inc. to increase its marketing and sales efforts domestically. The Company’s near term goal is to spin off ChineseHempOil.com, Inc. and its other hemp related assets before year end, December 31, 2018. Long term, for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2019, the Company hopes to achieve sales revenues of $600,000-$1,000,000 which will be accomplished by expanding its sales department and its marketing campaign.
 
In June 2018, the U.S. Senate on passed the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Farm Bill), which includes a measure to legalize hemp as an agricultural commodity. Under the measure, it appears that hemp would be removed from the federal list of controlled substances.
 
The Hemp Farming Act of 2018 allows states to become the primary regulators of hemp production. It also allows hemp researchers to apply for competitive federal grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and makes hemp farmers eligible to apply for crop insurance.
 
Market Overview
 
Domestic Markets
 
Through member-based distribution network, the Company has access to the major markets in California, New York and most other states in United States. ChineseHempOil.com, Inc. currently markets its hemp products via online channels including but not limited to www.ChineseHempOil.com and via retail-channels.

Competition
 
At present, non-industrial hemp health products are widely available in the United States. Our main goal is to distinguish ourselves through targeted ethnic marketing and enhanced product delivery technology.
Intellectual Property
 
The Company is preparing applications for federal trademark registration to further protect updated versions of its logos and has applications in process for its subsidiary, ChineseHempOil.com, Inc.’s Opthemp and Gold Plus OptHemp Premium Hemp Oil logos currently in use. Moreover, it is planning research and development of its own formulas and may seek to patent and trademark these products in development.
Government Regulation
 
Marijuana remains illegal under Federal law.
 
Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law. Since federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana preempts state laws that legalize its use, strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in our inability to proceed with our business plan. In large the Federal Government has refrained from enforcing the Federal Laws in states that have legalized marijuana. In a 2013 policy statement the Department of Justice stated that it intends to confine itself to eight objectives: Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors; Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels; Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form from going to other states; Preventing state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and use of marijuana; Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use; Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property. Earlier this year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions hinted that the Department of Justice might begin more aggressive enforcement of federal laws against recreational marijuana, even in states that have legalized. Sessions' comments have echoed White House spokesman Sean Spicer, who predicted harsher prosecution of marijuana under the Trump Administration. If the Trump Administration were to crack down on states with legalized marijuana, the Department of Justice would have to lead the charge. Consequently, marijuana stock prices tend to move whenever Sessions mentions the topic. This would mark a significant priority shift from the Obama Administration’s 2013 policy statement discussed above. Nevertheless, there have been indications in 2018 that the Trump Administration is likely to continue to leave marijuana policy to the states.
 
Laws and regulations affecting the medical marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations.
 
Local, state, and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter certain aspects of our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt certain aspects of our business plan and result in a material adverse effect on certain aspects of our planned operations. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business. However, many influential people in the Cannabis Industry are lobbying diligently within the new administration to legalize Cannabis federally.
 
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Rule Effective in January 2017 labeled Marijuana, Hemp and Their Derivatives as Schedule I substances.
 
On December 14, 2016, the Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) made an update to the Federal Register item (21 CFR Part 1308), creating a new Administration Controlled Substances Code Number for Marihuana Extract (hereinafter, the “Marijuana Extract Rule”). Marijuana Extract is defined therein as “. . . an extract containing one or more cannabinoids that has been derived from any plant of the genus Cannabis, other than the separated resin (whether crude or purified) obtained from the plant.” The Marijuana Extract Rule confirms that as of January 17, 2017, a harsher cannabis law will be put into place reclassifying non-THC cannabis oil as a schedule 1 drug, despite the fact cannabidiol (“CBD”) extracts are non-psychoactive.

15
--

 

Thereafter, on or about March 13 2017, the DEA issued a clarification of the Marijuana Extract Rule and appeared to back off of its position somewhat. The DEA’s highlights of its clarification are that: The “marihuana extract” definition does not include materials or products excluded from the definition of marijuana set forth in the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”). The CSA states: "The term 'marihuana' means all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such plant, its seeds or resin. Such term does not include the mature stalks of such plant, fiber produced from such stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds of such plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such mature stalks (except the resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake, or the sterilized seed of such plant which is incapable of germination." 21 U.S.C. § 802(16). Therefore, it appears that if a product consists solely of parts of the cannabis plant excluded from the CSA definition of marijuana, such product is not considered “marihuana” or a “marihuana extract.” In other words, CBD products derived solely from mature stalks or non-industrial hemp containing little-to-no THC don’t appear to be prohibited under the Marihuana Extract Rule. However, this clarification is not an official ruling by the DEA as it does not have the same authority as a formal rule. Instead, this clarification provides guidance as to how the DEA will enforce the Marihuana Extract Rule. In addition, the Marihuana Extract Rule is currently subject to an appeal pending in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals by members of the hemp industry, and this clarification may cause that court to rule that the clarification limits the final rule. In conclusion, the Marijuana Extract Rule itself carries more legal authority and this clarification is not an official ruling by the DEA — it is the agency’s interpretation of its own rule, which could change as the DEA so desires.
 
Recently, The Hemp Industries Association (HIA) issued this statement regarding its settlement with the DEA reached on Friday, May 25, 2018, in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold the legality of consumption, manufacturing and sale of hemp food products. Also, thereafter, in June 2018, the U.S. Senate on passed the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Farm Bill), which includes a measure to legalize hemp as an agricultural commodity. Under the measure, it appears that hemp would be removed from the federal list of controlled substances. The Hemp Farming Act of 2018 allows states to become the primary regulators of hemp production. It also allows hemp researchers to apply for competitive federal grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and makes hemp farmers eligible to apply for crop insurance.
 
Our business is subject to strict government regulations.
 
The processing, formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of our products are subject to federal laws and regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency. These activities are also regulated by various state, local, and international laws and agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. Government regulations may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of our products, which could result in lost revenues and increased costs to us. For instance, the FDA regulates, among other things, the composition, safety, labeling, and marketing of dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary ingredients for human use). The FDA may not accept the evidence of safety for any new dietary ingredient that we may wish to market, may determine that a particular dietary supplement or ingredient presents an unacceptable health risk, and may determine that a particular claim or statement of nutritional value that we use to support the marketing of a dietary supplement is an impermissible drug claim, is not substantiated, or is an unauthorized version of a “health claim.”
 
Any of these actions could prevent us from marketing particular dietary supplement products or making certain claims or statements of nutritional support for them. The FDA could also require us to remove a particular product from the market. Any future recall or removal would result in additional costs to us, including lost revenues from any additional products that we are required to remove from the market, any of which could be material. Any product recalls or removals could also lead to liability, substantial costs, and reduced growth prospects. With respect to FTC matters, if the FTC has reason to believe the law is being violated (e.g. failure to possess adequate substantiation for product claims), it can initiate an enforcement action. The FTC has a variety of processes and remedies available to it for enforcement, both administratively and judicially, including compulsory process authority, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement could result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, consumer redress, and divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, or such other relief as may be deemed necessary. Violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Any action against us by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products.

Additional or more stringent regulations of dietary supplements and other products have been considered from time to time. These developments could require reformulation of some products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of some products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of some products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, adverse event reporting, or other new requirements. Any of these developments could increase our costs significantly. For example, the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act (S.3546), which was passed by Congress in December 2006, imposes significant regulatory requirements on dietary supplements including reporting of “serious adverse events” to FDA and recordkeeping requirements. This legislation could raise our costs and negatively impact our business. In June 2007, the FDA adopted final regulations on GMPs in manufacturing, packaging, or holding dietary ingredients and dietary supplements, which apply to the products we may manufacture and sell. These regulations require dietary supplements to be prepared, packaged, and held in compliance with certain rules. These regulations could raise our costs and negatively impact our business. Additionally, our third-party suppliers or vendors may not be able to comply with these rules without incurring substantial expenses. If our third-party suppliers or vendors are not able to timely comply with these new rules, we may experience increased cost or delays in obtaining certain raw materials and third-party products. Also, the FDA has announced that it plans to publish guidance governing the notification of new dietary ingredients. Although FDA guidance is not mandatory, it is a strong indication of the FDA’s current views on the topic discussed in the guidance, including its position on enforcement.
 
Investors risk criminal liability and the cannabis business’s assets are subject to forfeiture. 
 
Because marijuana is illegal under federal criminal law, investing in cannabis businesses could be found to violate the federal Controlled Substances Act. Not only can investors and company directors or management be indicted under federal law, all of the assets they contribute to a cannabis business (and even to an ancillary cannabis business), including real property, cash, equipment and other goods, could be subject to asset forfeiture because marijuana is still federally illegal. Nevertheless, there have been indications in 2018 that the Trump Administration is likely to continue to leave marijuana policy to the states.
 
Marijuana businesses may still not be able to secure bank accounts. 
 
Though more banks are providing services to marijuana businesses, most banks and financial institutions will not because they worry about criminal liability under the federal Controlled Substances Act and under the Bank Secrecy Act for money laundering. Though FinCEN issued guidelines in 2014 that allow financial institutions to provide bank accounts to marijuana businesses, few banks have taken advantage of those guidelines and many marijuana businesses still operate on an all-cash basis. This makes it tough for cannabis businesses to manage their businesses, pay their employees and taxes, and having so much cash on hand also creates significant public safety issues. Many ancillary businesses that service cannabis businesses have to deal with the unpredictability of their clients or customers not having a bank account.
 
IRC 280E 
 
Internal Revenue Code section 280E prohibits marijuana businesses from deducting their ordinary and necessary business expenses, forcing them to contend with higher effective federal tax rates than similar companies in other industries. The effective tax rate on a marijuana business depends on how large its ratio of nondeductible expenses is to its total revenues, but it can be as high as 90%, affecting the future profitability of a marijuana business or even ancillary business.
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not Approved use of Cannabidiol as a Dietary Supplement.
 
The FDA has concluded that cannabidiol products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(ii) of the Food Drug and Cosmetic (“FD&C”) Act. The FDA’s ruling could have broad implications for an industry built atop the potential health benefits of CBDs, including marketing strategies and product labeling to account for such rules which state that companies cannot make claims as to proven health or medical efficacy without FDA approval. As such, even if we generally try to comply with existing FDA rules to the extent possible, compliance may not guarantee escaping regulatory scrutiny. Still, a compliance strategy should decrease risk exposure, including from truth-in-advertising claims brought by consumers related to CBD products that we intend to market.

Market Overview
 
Domestic & International Markets
 
CBD Biotech currently markets its hemp-infused skin care products and liquor products via online channels in China.
 
Market Opportunity
 
Skin care awareness and consciousness are some of the driving forces behind the booming skin care industry. Moreover, there is a rising demand for natural and organic products with no unnecessary chemicals, parabens, additives or fillers. Meanwhile, anti-aging products have shifted to those that do not just target wrinkles but also dry skin, uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation and dark circles under eyes.
 
As Chinese consumers have seen their buying power grow over these past few years, they have bought more cosmetics than they used to. We are all now influenced by Asian countries’ beauty rituals. The US skin care market is expected to reach nearly $11 billion by 2018. CBD Biotech understands this mentality and will strive to meet consumer expectations both internationally and domestically in China by including hemp extract in its skin care products. Some dermatologists believe that the anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory agents in hemp extract can positively impact the skin. Recognizing the untapped market potential, CBD Biotech Ltd. is marketing g what it believes to be the first line of hemp-infused skin care products in China.
 
Competition
 
At present, CBD Biotech is not aware of any skin care products in China infused with hemp oil extract. As such it strives to be the leader when it comes to hemp infused cosmetics in China. Although skin care products containing hemp extract are currently being marketed in the US, CBD Biotech hopes to be able to gain market share in the US as well and specifically among Chinese consumers in the US.
