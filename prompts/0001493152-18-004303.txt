General
 
Sierra Monitor Corporation, a California corporation (the “Company”, “Sierra Monitor”, “we” or “us”), was founded in 1978. The Company addresses the industrial and commercial facilities management market with Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”) solutions that target facility automation and facility safety requirements, also referred to as “Connect” and “Protect”.

Products and Applications
 
The Connect business is our FieldServer family of protocol gateways, routers, and network explorers which targets industrial and facilities automation. The products are used by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and systems integrators to enable local and remote monitoring and control of assets and facilities. With more than 270,000 installed gateways supporting over 140 protocols such as BACnet, LonWorks, MODBUS, and XML in commercial and industrial facilities, FieldServer is one of the industry’s leading multi-protocol gateway brands. The intellectual property in FieldServer products is the software which runs on a range of hardware platforms, from embedded silicon to channel-ready gateways, and with a variety of interfaces including serial, Ethernet, Wi-Fi and cellular, appropriate to the asset being interfaced. The FieldServer family of products interface to the SMCCloud device management and big-data storage platform. With SMCCloud, OEMs and systems integrators can better manage their customers and field-deployed assets by registering, monitoring, logging and remotely accessing third-party equipment from the portal or smartphone app. SMCCloud can interface with third-party cloud solutions over various interfaces including REST APIs built on Amazon Web Services (AWS). In addition, FieldServer includes value-added “edge computing” capabilities for monitoring, logging, alarming, and trending local field data. In 2017, combined revenue from sales of our FieldServer family of products was approximately 51% of our sales compared to approximately 54% in 2016.
 
The Protect business is our flame and gas detection solutions that address facility safety requirements and are used by industrial and commercial facilities managers to protect their personnel and assets. The motivation for installing life-safety systems like gas and flame detection is driven, in part, by industrial safety professionals guided by country-specific safety regulations such as the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration, as well as state and local governing bodies, insurance companies and various industry rule-making bodies. Sierra Monitor’s solutions consists of three components. The SentryIT controller system that runs embedded logic and gateway software. A comprehensive line of industry certified detector modules that sense the presence of various toxic and combustible gases and flames. The Sentry InSite user interface and application software that a facility manager can interact with either locally on site or remotely via the SMCCloud portal. With more than 100,000 detector modules sold, our fire and gas detection solutions are proven, reliable, and deployed in a variety of facilities, such as oil, gas and chemical processing plants, wastewater treatment facilities, alternate fuel vehicle maintenance garages and other sites where hazardous gases are used or produced. Revenue from gas detection products was approximately 43% of our sales in 2017 and 2016.
 
Our solutions are also sold to telecommunication companies and their suppliers to manage environmental and safety conditions such as temperature, gas, and smoke in remote structures such as local DSL distribution nodes and buildings at cell tower sites. Revenue from all products sold to the telecommunications industry was approximately 6% of our sales in 2017, compared to 3% in 2016.
 
Research and Development
 
We maintain research and development programs to develop new products and to enhance and support existing products. We use a core group of experienced engineers, supported by a dynamic network of third-party specialists with skills as needed by specific projects. Our research and development expenses, which include costs for sustaining engineering and technical support, were $3,073,087 or 16% of our sales in 2017, compared to $2,950,651or 15% of our sales in 2016.
Sales and Distribution
 
We use a combination of in-region sales managers and a centralized inside sales and customer support team. Our in-region sales managers are located in western, central, southern and eastern regions of the United States. Additionally, we have in-region sales managers in Europe, the Middle East and Canada. The regional sales managers are supported by our inside sales and customer support team based in Milpitas, California.

Our FieldServer products are sold to hundreds of OEMS and integrators who then use the product as part of their system integration projects. We target OEMs in North America and Europe and integrators worldwide through in-region sales managers supported by inside sales and customer support team at our headquarters in Milpitas, California. Our FieldServer products are also available from leading on-line catalog distributors of industrial products.
 
Our flame and gas products are primarily sold to engineering and installation firms that utilize the products as part of larger fire and safety facility projects. Our in-region and headquarters-based sales teams work with a network of independent sales representatives and value-added resellers to identify and fulfill such opportunities. After-sale service is carried out by certified service partners. There are currently 27 authorized representative companies in the United States and approximately 16 international sales partners. The majority of our domestic representatives have exclusive territories and the sales agreements with each representative restrict them from representing competing products.
 
Our marketing activities include maintaining a comprehensive and search-optimized web site and social media presence, participating in relevant trade shows and events, issuing newsletters, blogging, conducting on-line seminars and other forms of communication, seeking press coverage, and developing tools to assist in the selling effort.
 
Our selling and marketing expenses for 2017 were $5,165,931 or 26% of revenue, compared to $4,899,882 or 26% of revenue in 2016.
 
We consider that we operate in one business segment. Substantially all of the revenues reported in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are attributable to sales to that single segment. See “Note 8: Segment Reporting” to our Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Employees
 
On December 31, 2017, we had a total of 82 full-time employees and consultants. At that date, 56 were located in Milpitas, California, and the rest were based out of regional offices.
Seasonality and Customer Concentration
 
The demand for monitoring devices and other products we manufacture is typically not seasonal. There were no customers to whom sales exceeded 10% of our net sales during 2017, or 2016. Factors affecting specific industries, such as telecommunications, building automation or petro-chemical processing, could affect our sales within any of those industries. Those factors may include, but are not limited to, a general economic downturn, labor problems, and rapid shifts in technology or introduction of competing products at lower prices.
Backlog
 
The commercial order backlog for our products at December 31, 2017 was approximately $4,943,137 compared to approximately $4,647,653 at December 31, 2016. The backlog includes orders for which we have not yet received engineering release from the customer. Since we generally ship many of our products within the same quarter that we receive a purchase order and engineering release from the customer, we believe that our backlog at any particular time is generally not indicative of the level of future sales.

Competition 
 
The facility management market for automation and safety applications is highly competitive and generally price sensitive. The solutions that address this market compete on reliability, ease of use, product support, price, and increasingly, the ability to enable the IIoT vision.
 
Our FieldServer family of protocol gateway products competes in the building or industrial automation industries with products or alternate methods and technologies offered by, among others, Honeywell Tridium, Contemporary Controls, HMS, Control Solutions Inc., Loytec Electronics, and in some cases protocol gateway functionality developed in-house by device or system OEMs. In application areas outside of building and industrial automation where multi-protocol translation requirements are fewer, FieldServer protocol gateways may compete with gateways provided by companies such as Dell and Advantech. Our FieldPoP device cloud may compete with cloud-based platform offerings from companies such as PTC/ThingWorx, Amazon AWS IoT, Microsoft Azure IoT, Google Cloud, and other IoT startup companies.
 
Our flame and gas detection products compete with systems offered by Draeger Safety Inc., Mine Safety Appliance Company, Honeywell Life Safety, TYCO, and the Detector Electronics division of UTC. Most of these competitors in the fire and gas detection area offer broad product lines including items that do not compete with our products and have greater financial, marketing and manufacturing resources than we do.
 
Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
We purchase materials and components for use in manufacturing our products. The majority of the materials and components used in our products are standard items which can be purchased from multiple distributors or fabricated by multiple custom fabrication vendors. Components which are generally purchased from sole sources are those which require a specific consistent quality such as gas sensors. Our principal suppliers of gas sensors are City Technology, Dynament and E2V Technologies. We anticipate that the majority of components and materials used in products to be developed by us will be readily available. However, there is no assurance that the current availability of these materials will continue in the future, or if available, will be procurable at favorable prices.
Environmental Regulation
 
We have no significant costs associated with compliance with environmental regulations. However, there can be no assurance that we will not incur such costs in the future.
Major Customers
 
Two customers exceeded 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable during the year ended December 31, 2017, but no customers exceeded 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable during the year ended December 31, 2016. Further, no customers exceeded 10% of the Company’s sales during the years ended December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.
