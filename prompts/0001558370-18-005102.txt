     Customers
    
The Company evaluates its business within two segments: commercial and retail. The commercial segment consists of the following customer markets: (1) public carriers that are generally responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure system and provide airtime service to individual subscribers; (2) government including federal agencies 

 
  3

 
and state and local governments that run wireless networks for their own use as well as value-added resellers who specialize in selling to the government;  (3) private system operators including commercial entities such as enterprise customers, major utilities and transportation companies; and (4) value-added resellers that sell, install and/or service cellular telephone, wireless networking, broadband and  two-way radio communications equipment primarily for the enterprise market. The retail segment consists of the market which includes retailers, independent dealer agents and carriers.  The evaluation of the Company's business in this manner began with the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, and reflects the modification at that time of the Company's internal organization structure in an effort to better serve the market place.  Retail inventory typically has a shorter more defined life cycle and is, typically, ultimately used by individual end users. Commercial inventory typically has a life cycle that tends to be tied to changes in regulation or technology and includes products typically used by business entities or governments. Reflective of these differences, our sales and product teams were reorganized and each now report to either a retail or commercial leader.  All prior financial periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflect this change.
     Public carriers are system operators that are generally responsible for building and maintaining the public infrastructure system and providing airtime service to individual subscribers, and accounted for approximately 20% of our fiscal year 2018 revenues. Government, including federal agencies and state and local governments, accounted for 7% of fiscal year 2018 revenues. Private system operators, including commercial entities, major utilities, transportation companies, manufacturers, and installation centers, accounted for 16% of fiscal year 2018 revenues. Value-added resellers sell, install and/or service cellular telephone, wireless networking, broadband, and two-way radio communications equipment for the enterprise and consumer markets, and accounted for 24% of fiscal year 2018 revenues. Our retailers, independent dealer agents and carriers market accounted for 33% of fiscal year 2018 revenues.  
     Our top ten customer relationships totaled 28% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2018, and no customer relationship accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. 
     Approximately 98% of our sales have been made to customers in the United States during each of the past three fiscal years, although we currently sell to customers in almost 100 countries. Due to our diverse product offering and our wide customer base, our business is not significantly affected by seasonality in the aggregate. However, sales to our retailers generally peak in our second and third quarters in conjunction with significant handset launches and the winter holiday, season and decline significantly in our fourth quarter. Also, our base station infrastructure sales are typically affected by weather conditions in the United States, especially in our fourth quarter.
     For more detailed financial information regarding customer market and product category activity within our two operating segments for each of the past three fiscal years, see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2018.
     Products and Services
     We principally offer competitively priced, manufacturer brand-name products, ranging from simple hardware items to sophisticated test equipment, with per item prices ranging from less than $1 to over $50,000 and gross profit margins ranging from less than 5% to 100%. We offer products classified into our four business categories: base station infrastructure; network systems; installation, test and maintenance products; and mobile devices and accessories, which accounted for approximately 43%, 17%, 6%, and 34% of fiscal year 2018 revenues, respectively. Base station infrastructure products are used to build, repair and upgrade wireless broadband systems. These products include base station antennas, cable and transmission lines, small towers, lightning protection devices, connectors, power systems, enclosures, grounding, jumpers, miscellaneous hardware, and mobile antennas. Our base station infrastructure service offering includes program management, connector installation, custom jumper assembly, site kitting and logistics integration. Network systems products are used to build and upgrade public and private wireless broadband networks. Products include fixed and mobile broadband radio equipment, wireless networking filtering systems, distributed antenna systems, two-way radios and security and surveillance products. This product category also includes training classes, technical support and engineering design services. Installation, test and maintenance products are used to install, tune, and maintain wireless communications equipment. Products include sophisticated analysis equipment and various frequency-, voltage- and power-measuring devices, as well as an assortment of tools, hardware, GPS, safety, replacement and component parts and supplies required by service technicians.  Mobile devices and accessory products include cellular, 

 
  4

 
smart phone and data device accessories such as power supplies, cases, screen protectors, speakers, mobile amplifiers, bluetooth and corded headsets, mounts, car antennas, music accessories and data and memory cards. 
     While we principally provide manufacturer brand-name products, a variety of products are developed, manufactured and offered under TESSCO-owned brands including Ventev, Wireless Solutions, and TerraWave®. The products we offer under these brands generally consist of device accessory products that fall into the mobile device and accessory product category, as well as WLAN and network systems accessory products and remote monitoring and control solutions that fall into the base station and network systems category. We have not incurred significant research and development expenditures in any of the last three fiscal years. Sales of proprietary products were 13% of our total sales in fiscal year 2018. 
     Our products are sold as part of our integrated product and supply chain solutions. Our supply chain services for all product areas are grouped under either Knowledge, Configuration, Delivery or Control. Knowledge solutions include the entire suite of TESSCO knowledge tools that focus on educating the industry, including product highlights, showcases and/or comparisons, with comprehensive specifications on the products, solutions and applications that are offered and reinforced by engineering, sales and technical support. Configuration services are comprised of customized product solution kitting and assembly, logistics management and consumer and retail merchandising and marketing, allowing the products to be delivered ready for immediate use, installation or resale. Our Delivery system allows the customer to select speed of delivery options and to select specific delivery locations, all designed to eliminate the customer’s need for staging and warehousing. Our services that increase customer control include predetermined monthly pricing levels, the ability to monitor multi-site purchasing with pre-approved, customized parameters indicating who is able to order how much of which specific products, order delivery tracking, product usage tracking, history reporting and alternative financing options. 
     As part of our commitment to customer service, we typically allow most customers to return most products for any reason, for credit, within 30 days of the date of purchase. Total returns and credits have been less than 3% of revenues in each of the past three fiscal years. 
     Revenues from sales of products purchased from our largest wireless infrastructure and mobile device and accessories supplier accounted for 11% and 10%, respectively, of total fiscal year 2018 revenues. Sales of products purchased from our ten largest vendors generated approximately 43% of our total fiscal year 2018 revenues. 
     The amount of purchases we make from each of our approximately 440 vendors may significantly increase or decrease over time.  As the level of business changes, we may request, or be requested by our vendors, to adjust the terms of our relationships.  Therefore, our ability to purchase and re-sell products from each of our vendors depends on being able to reach and maintain agreements with these vendors on acceptable business terms.  In addition, the agreements and arrangements on which most of our larger vendor relationships are based are typically of limited duration and terminable for any or no reason by either party upon notice of varying lengths, usually between several months or otherwise short notice. Generally, we believe that alternative sources of supply are available for many of the product types we carry, although we may be unable, or find it more difficult, to source branded products from other than the manufacturer. 
     The scope of products available for purchase from a given vendor may fluctuate, and is generally limited only by the scope of the vendor’s catalog and available inventory. Therefore, we often source the same product type from multiple vendors, although in some instances branded products are available only from the manufacturer or a particular vendor, and in some instances, customers might favor one vendor or brand over another. The terms of the vendor contract typically apply to all products purchased from a particular vendor, whether or not the item is specifically identified in the contract. 
     When negotiating with vendors, we seek the most favorable terms available under the circumstances. Our preferred terms include among others, terms that provide for product warranty and return rights, as well as product liability and intellectual property indemnification rights, in each case consistent with our preferred business methods and objectives. We have not been able, nor do we expect in the future to be able, to negotiate the inclusion of all our preferred terms, or our preferred language for those terms, in every vendor contract. The degree of our success in this regard is largely a function of the parties’ relative bargaining positions.

 We are dedicated to superior performance, quality and consistency of service in an effort to maintain and expand vendor relationships but there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in this regard in the future, or that competitive pressures or other events beyond our control will not have a negative impact on our ability to maintain these relationships or to continue to derive revenues from these relationships.
     Method of Operation
     We believe that we have developed a highly integrated, technologically advanced and efficient method of operation based on the following key tenets:

 TESSCO.com empowers our customers to make better decisions by delivering product knowledge so they are fully informed. This destination also enables our manufacturers to reach a broad and diverse customer base with their product offer and brand features. 
     Customer Support and Order Entry: Our customer support teams are responsible for responding to what we refer to as "the moments of truth" by delivering sales and customer support services through an effective and efficient transaction system. We also continually monitor our customer service performance through report cards sent for each product delivery, customer surveys and regular interaction with customers. By combining our broad product offering with a commitment to superior customer service, we seek to reduce a customer's overall procurement costs by enabling the customer to consolidate the number of suppliers from which it obtains products, while also reducing the customer's need to maintain high inventory levels. 
     Our information technology system provides detailed information on every customer account, including recent inquiries, buying and credit histories, separate buying locations within a customer account and contact diaries for key personnel, as well as detailed product information, including technical, product availability and pricing information. The information technology system increases sales productivity by enabling any customer support representative to provide any customer with personalized service and also allows non-technical personnel to provide a high level of technical product information and order assistance. 
     We believe that our commitment to providing prompt, friendly and efficient customer service before, during and after the sale enables us to maximize sales, customer satisfaction and customer retention. The monthly average number of non-consumer customers decreased from approximately 12,500 for fiscal year 2017 to approximately 11,600 in fiscal year 2018, primarily due to consolidation in the retail market. The average monthly purchase per customer increased from $3,600 in fiscal year 2017 to $4,200 in fiscal year 2018.
     Procurement and Inventory Management: Our product management and purchasing system aims to provide customers with a total source of broad and deep product availability, while maximizing the return on our inventory investment. 
     We use our information technology system to monitor and manage our inventory. Historical sales results, sales projections and information regarding vendor lead times are all used to determine appropriate inventory levels. The information technology system also provides early warning reports regarding upcoming inventory requirements. As of April 1, 2018, and March 26, 2017, we had an immaterial level of backlog orders. Most backlog orders as of April 1, 2018 are expected to be filled within 90 days of fiscal year-end. For fiscal years ended April 1, 2018 and March 26, 2017, inventory write-offs were 1.0% and 0.7% of total purchases, respectively. In many cases, we are able to return slow-moving inventory to our vendors pursuant to stock rotation agreements. Inventory turns for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were 6.8 and 7.2, respectively. 
     Fulfillment and Distribution: Orders are received at our Timonium, Maryland, Reno, Nevada and San Antonio, Texas customer sales support centers. As orders are received, customer representatives have access to technical information, alternative and complementary product selections, product availability and pricing information, as well as customer purchasing and credit histories and recent inquiry summaries. An automated warehouse management system, which is integrated with the product planning and procurement system, allows us to ensure inventory control, to minimize multiple product shipments to complete an order and to limit inventory duplication. Bar-coded labels are used on every product, allowing distribution center personnel to utilize radio frequency scanners to locate products, fill orders and update inventory records in real-time, thus reducing overhead associated with the distribution functions. We contract with a variety of freight line and parcel transportation carrier partners to deliver orders to customers. 
     Performance and Delivery Guarantee (PDG) charges are generally calculated on the basis of the weight of the products ordered and on the delivery service requested, rather than on distance to the customer. We believe that this approach emphasizes on-time delivery instead of shipment dates, enabling customers to minimize their inventories and reduce their overall procurement costs while guaranteeing date specific delivery, thereby encouraging them to make us their total source supplier.

 Information Technology: Our information technology system is critical to the success of our operations. We have made substantial investments in the development of this system, which integrates cataloging, marketing, sales, fulfillment, inventory control and purchasing, financial control and internal and external communications. The information technology system includes highly developed customer and product databases and is integrated with our Configuration, Fulfillment and Delivery system. The information contained in the system is available on a real-time basis to all of our employees as needed and is utilized in every area of our operations.
     We believe that we have been successful to date in pursuing a highly integrated, technologically advanced and efficient method of operations; however, disruption to our day-to-day operations, including failure of our information technology or distribution systems, or freight carrier interruption, could impair our ability to receive and process orders or to ship products in a timely and cost-efficient manner. 
     Competition
     The wireless communications distribution industry is competitive and fragmented, and is comprised of distributors such as Brightstar, D&H, Superior Communications and VoiceComm in our retail segment and Alliance Corporation, Anixter, Comstor, Graybar, Hutton Communication, KPGCo Logistics, Ingram Micro, Talley Communications, Tech Data, Site Pro 1, VAV Wireless, Westcon and Winncom in our commercial markets. In addition, many manufacturers sell and fulfill directly to customers. Barriers to entry for distributors are relatively low, particularly in the mobile devices and accessory market, and the risk of new competitors entering the market is high. In addition, the agreements or arrangements with our customers or vendors looking to us for product and supply chain solutions are typically of limited duration and are often terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise short notice. Accordingly, our ability to maintain these relationships is subject to competitive pressures and challenges. Some of our current competitors have substantially greater capital resources and sales and distribution capabilities than we do. In response to competitive pressures from any of our current or future competitors, we may be required to lower selling prices in order to maintain or increase market share, and such measures could adversely affect our operating results. We believe, however, that our strength in service, the breadth and depth of our product offering, our information technology system, our knowledge and expertise in wireless technologies and the wireless marketplace, and our large customer base and purchasing relationships with approximately 440 manufacturers, provide us with a significant competitive advantage over new entrants to the market. 
     Continuing changes in the wireless communications industry, including risks associated with conflicting technology, changes in technology, inventory obsolescence, and consolidation among wireless carriers, could adversely affect future operating results. 
     We believe that the principal competitive factors in supplying products to the wireless communications industry are the quality and consistency of customer service, particularly timely delivery of complete orders, breadth and quality of products offered and total procurement costs to the customer. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. In particular, we believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors based on the breadth of our product offering, our ability to quickly provide products and supply chain solutions in response to customer demand and technological advances, our knowledge and expertise in wireless technologies and the wireless marketplace, the level of our customer service and the reliability of our order fulfillment process. 
     Intellectual Property
     We seek to protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, service marks, confidentiality agreements, trade secret protection and, if and when appropriate, patent protection. Thus far, we have generally sought to protect our intellectual property, including our product data and information, customer information and information technology systems, through trademark filings and nondisclosure, confidentiality and trade secret agreements. We typically require our employees, consultants, and others having access to our intellectual property, to sign confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements. There can be no assurance that these confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements will be honored, or whether they can be fully enforced, or that other entities may not independently develop systems, technologies or information similar to that on which we rely.

There were no material capital expenditures for environmental projects in fiscal year 2018, and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in fiscal year 2019.     Employees
     As of April 1, 2018, we had 768 full-time equivalent employees. Of our full-time equivalent employees, 359 were engaged in customer and vendor service, marketing, sales and product management, 297 were engaged in fulfillment and distribution operations and 112 were engaged in administration and technology systems services. No employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be excellent.
