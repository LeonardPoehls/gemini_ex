Item 1. | Business.

Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing new standards of care for individuals living with rare diseases. We, through Aegerion, have two commercial products:

• | Lomitapide is marketed in the United States ("U.S.") under the brand name JUXTAPID (lomitapide) capsules ("JUXTAPID"). JUXTAPID is approved in the U.S. as an adjunct to a low-fat diet and other lipid-lowering treatments, including low-density lipoprotein ("LDL") apheresis where available, to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ("LDL-C"), total cholesterol ("TC"), apolipoprotein B ("apo B") and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ("non-HDL-C") in adult patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ("HoFH"). Lomitapide is approved in the European Union ("EU"), under the brand name LOJUXTA (lomitapide) hard capsules ("LOJUXTA") for the treatment of adult patients with HoFH, as well as in Japan, Canada, and a limited number of other countries. In December 2016, Aegerion launched JUXTAPID as a treatment for HoFH in Japan. Aegerion receives sales milestones and royalties on net sales of LOJUXTA in the EU and certain other jurisdictions from Amryt Pharma plc ("Amryt"), to whom Aegerion out-licensed the rights to commercialize LOJUXTA in those jurisdictions in December 2016. Lomitapide is also sold, on a named patient sales basis, in Brazil and in a limited number of other countries outside the U.S. where such sales are

2

permitted before regulatory approval in such country as a result of the approval of lomitapide in the U.S. or the EU. We plan to file for regulatory approval for lomitapide for the treatment of HoFH in Brazil in 2018. 

• | Metreleptin, a recombinant analog of human leptin, is marketed in the U.S. under the brand name MYALEPT (metreleptin) for injection ("MYALEPT"). MYALEPT is approved in the U.S. as an adjunct to diet as replacement therapy to treat the complications of leptin deficiency in patients with congenital or acquired generalized lipodystrophy ("GL"). In December 2016, we submitted a marketing authorization application ("MAA") to the European Medicines Agency ("EMA") to seek approval for metreleptin in the EU, under the brand name MYALEPTA, as replacement therapy to treat complications of leptin deficiency in patients with GL and in a subset of patients with partial lipodystrophy ("PL"). In February 2018, we presented at an oral hearing of the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”). Based on the CHMP’s feedback at and after the hearing, we have requested a two-month “clock stop” of the CHMP’s review to allow for the preparation of responses and additional data focused, primarily, on the PL patient subset. Subject to our ability to address the CHMP’s feedback during the “clock stop” period, we anticipate that the CHMP will issue its opinion in the second quarter of 2018 and the European Commission (“EC”) will issue its decision in mid-2018. We plan to file for regulatory approvals for metreleptin in GL and, subject largely to whether we receive EMA approval of any PL subset indication, such PL subset in other key markets, including Brazil in late 2018. We offer metreleptin through expanded access programs in countries where permitted by applicable regulatory authorities and under applicable laws, and generate revenues in certain markets where named patient sales are permitted based on the approval of metreleptin in the U.S. We plan to initiate, by late 2018, a phase 2 trial assessing metreleptin in hypoleptinemic metabolic disorder (“HMD”), a low leptin mediated metabolic disease, subject to approval of our protocol and statistical plan by applicable regulatory authorities. We also plan to continue to explore new opportunities for metreleptin to treat certain other low-leptin mediated metabolic diseases, and are reviewing options for raising capital to fund such opportunities, along with later-stage studies in HMD, upon which such opportunities are largely dependent.

We also have one product candidate, zuretinol acetate ("zuretinol"), an oral synthetic retinoid in development for the treatment of inherited retinal disease ("IRD") caused by underlying mutations in retinal pigment epithelium protein 65 ("RPE65") and lecithin: retinol acyltransferase ("LRAT") genes, comprising Leber Congenital Amaurosis ("LCA") and Retinitis Pigmentosa ("RP"). Following a comprehensive pipeline review, we are evaluating options for out-licensing zuretinol.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, net revenues from lomitapide and metreleptin were $138.4 million, of which $97.4 million was derived from prescriptions for lomitapide and metreleptin written in the U.S., and $41.0 million was derived from prescriptions written for and royalties on sales of lomitapide and metreleptin outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $55.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. We have approximately $325.0 million principal amount of 2.0% convertible senior notes due August 15, 2019 (the "Convertible Notes"). To resolve certain Department of Justice ("DOJ") and Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") investigations regarding Aegerion’s U.S. commercial activities and disclosures related to JUXTAPID, Aegerion is, among other obligations, required to pay approximately $40.1 million in civil penalties, restitution and settlement amounts (plus interest) over three years. See the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” section and the “Legal Proceedings” section of this Annual Report for further information.
In the near-term, we expect that the majority of revenues will continue to be derived from sales of JUXTAPID and MYALEPT in the U.S. We also expect to generate revenues from (i) sales in those countries outside the U.S. in which we have or expect to receive marketing approval, are able to obtain pricing and reimbursement approval at acceptable levels, and elect to commercialize the products, and (ii) sales of both products in a limited number of other countries where they are, or may in the future be, available on a named patient sales basis as a result of approvals in the U.S. or EU. We expect that in the near-term, our largest sources of revenues after the U.S., on a country-by-country basis, will be, sales of JUXTAPID in Japan and named patient sales of both of our products in Brazil. We have had, and expect to continue to have, named patient sales of metreleptin in Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and a select number of other key markets, including France and Turkey. We expect net revenues from named patient sales to fluctuate significantly quarter-over-quarter given that named patient sales are derived from unsolicited requests from prescribers. In some countries, including Brazil, orders for named patient sales are for multiple months of therapy, which can lead to fluctuation in sales depending on the ordering pattern.
We expect that our near-term efforts will be focused on the following:

• | continuing to sell JUXTAPID as a last-line treatment for adult HoFH patients in the U.S. despite the availability of PCSK9 inhibitor products, which have had a significant adverse impact on sales of JUXTAPID, and gaining market acceptance in the other countries, including Japan, where lomitapide is approved and being commercialized, or may in the future receive approval and be commercialized;

3


• | reviewing our holding and capital structure with a view towards optimizing our assets and improving our balance sheet;


• | managing our costs and expenses to better align with our revenues, while supporting approved products in a compliant manner;


• | continuing to support patient access to and reimbursement for our products in the U.S. without significant restrictions, particularly given the availability of PCSK9 inhibitor products in the U.S., which has adversely impacted reimbursement of JUXTAPID, and given the considerable number of eligible JUXTAPID patients in the U.S. who are on Medicare Part D and the significant percentage of such patients who may not be able to afford their out-of-pocket co-payments for our products, given that prior sources of financial support for some of the patients through patient assistance programs operated by independent charitable 501(c)(3) organizations may no longer be available;


• | continuing to support sales of lomitapide as a treatment for HoFH in Brazil on a named patient sales basis, particularly in light of local economic challenges, ongoing government investigations, an ongoing court proceeding reviewing the regulatory framework for named patient sales in Brazil, and recently implemented regulatory requirements for named patient sales which have added complexity to the process for named patient sales in Brazil and we believe have led a significant number of patients to discontinue therapy with lomitapide, and continuing to support named patient sales in other key countries where such sales are permitted, despite the availability of PCSK9 inhibitors on a named patient sales basis in such countries;


• | initiating clinical development of metreleptin in HMD, and exploring potential new opportunities for metreleptin in additional indications, including certain other low-leptin mediated metabolic diseases, assuming we raise capital to fund such opportunities;


• | building and maintaining market acceptance for MYALEPT in the U.S. for the treatment of complications of leptin deficiency in GL patients, and supporting named patient sales of metreleptin in GL in Brazil, particularly in light of local economic challenges, ongoing government investigations, an ongoing court proceeding reviewing the regulatory framework for named patient sales in Brazil, and recently implemented regulatory requirements for named patient sales which have added complexity to the process for named patient sales in Brazil and we believe have led a significant number of patients to discontinue therapy with metreleptin, and supporting such sales in other key countries, including Turkey and France, where such sales are permitted;


• | gaining regulatory, pricing and reimbursement approvals to market our products in countries in which the products are not currently approved and/or reimbursed or for new indications, including obtaining approval of the MAA seeking marketing approval of metreleptin in the EU as a treatment for complications of leptin deficiency in GL patients and a subset of PL, and seeking approval of metreleptin in Brazil and other key markets as a treatment for complications of leptin deficiency in GL patients, and subject largely to whether we receive EMA approval of any PL subset indication, PL subset patients;


• | preparing for the launch of metreleptin in Europe as a treatment for complications of leptin deficiency in GL patients and a subset of PL, in the event we obtain regulatory, pricing and reimbursement approvals in the EU for metreleptin;


• | minimizing the number of patients who are eligible to receive but decide not to commence treatment with our products, or who discontinue treatment, by supporting activities such as patient support programs, to the extent permitted in a particular country;


• | Aegerion complying with the various agreements and judgments entered into with the DOJ and SEC in September 2017, and subsequently, and Aegerion's criminal sentencing in January 2018, including the payment of approximately $40.1 million in civil penalties, restitution and settlement amount (plus interest) over three years, and three-years of criminal probation, a civil settlement agreement with the DOJ, separate civil settlement agreements with multiple U.S. states, a final judgment entered in connection with a complaint filed by the SEC, a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ (the “DPA”), a five-year corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the "CIA"), and a pending civil consent decree with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and the DOJ relating to the JUXTAPID Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS") program, and managing other ongoing government investigations and related matters pertaining to its products;


• | engaging in possible further development efforts related to our existing products, and assessing, and possibly acquiring, potential new product candidates targeted at rare diseases where we believe we can leverage our infrastructure and expertise;

4


• | continuing to reinforce a culture of compliance, ethics and integrity throughout Novelion, Aegerion and their subsidiaries; and


• | defending challenges to the patents or our claims of exclusivity for our products in the U.S., including against potential generic submissions with the FDA with respect to lomitapide, and expanding the intellectual property portfolio for our products.

Investigations and Legal Proceedings
As noted above, Aegerion has been the subject of certain investigations and other legal proceedings (some of which remain ongoing), including investigations of Aegerion’s marketing and sales activities of JUXTAPID by the DOJ and the SEC, an investigation by federal and state authorities in Brazil to determine whether there have been violations of Brazilian laws related to the sales of JUXTAPID, and a putative class action lawsuit alleging certain misstatements and omissions related to the marketing of JUXTAPID and the Company’s financial performance in violation of the federal securities laws (the "Class Action Litigation"). Aegerion entered into agreements (the “Settlement”) with the DOJ and the SEC in September 2017 that required Aegerion, in addition to paying certain penalties and Settlement amounts, to plead guilty to two misdemeanor misbranding violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act and to enter into a three-year DPA with regard to a charge that it engaged in a conspiracy to violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA"). Aegerion was sentenced by the U.S. District Court on January 30, 2018 after the judge accepted Aegerion’s guilty criminal plea. Under the terms of the Settlement, including the sentence, Aegerion is required to pay approximately $40.1 million in aggregate penalties, plus interest, over three years, including $7.2 million of restitution, a civil penalty of $4.1 million to be paid to the SEC pursuant to an SEC Judgment, and $28.8 million (including $2.7 million designated for certain states), to be paid pursuant to the Civil Settlement Agreement, which is a significant financial burden given Aegerion’s financial condition. Aegerion made an initial payment to the DOJ on February 12, 2018, and an initial payment to certain states on February 15, 2018. On February 20, 2018, the DOJ filed a stipulation of dismissal in the civil qui tam matter. The FDA Consent Decree remains subject to approval by a U.S. District Court Judge. Aegerion also settled the Class Action Litigation for $22.3 million. The insurance carriers agreed to cover $22.0 million of this amount, with Aegerion responsible for the remainder of $0.3 million. See Part I, Item 3 - “Legal Proceedings” for further information regarding these investigations and legal proceedings.
Recent Corporate and Securities Transactions
New Loan Agreement. On March 15, 2018, Aegerion entered into a loan and security agreement (the “New Loan Agreement”) with affiliates of Broadfin Capital, LLC (“Broadfin Capital”) and Sarissa Capital Management LP (“Sarissa Capital” and, together with Broadfin Capital, the “Lenders”), pursuant to which the Lenders have made a single-draw term loan to Aegerion in an aggregate amount of $20.0 million (the “New Loan”), secured by substantially all of Aegerion’s assets, including a pledge of 66% of its first-tier foreign subsidiaries’ equity interests, and substantially all of the intellectual property and related rights in respect of MYALEPT and JUXTAPID, subject to certain exceptions. Interest on the New Loan accrues at 9.0% per annum. The term loan made pursuant to the New Loan Agreement matures on the earliest of (i) August 1, 2019, (ii) 30 days prior to the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, (iii) the date that any restructuring or recapitalization of all or substantially all of the Convertible Notes, including any exchange offer or similar transaction, is substantially consummated, and (iv) upon acceleration of the obligations under the New Loan Agreement. Concurrently with the execution of the New Loan Agreement, Novelion, Aegerion and the Lenders entered into a subordination agreement to subordinate the New Loan to the obligations of Aegerion to Novelion under the Amended and Restated Senior Loan Agreement (defined below), which is secured by the same collateral as the New Loan. 
In connection with the New Loan Agreement, the Lenders were issued warrants to purchase 1,818,592 Novelion common shares. The warrants have an exercise price equal to $4.40 per share, representing the volume weighted average price of Novelion common shares for the 20 trading days ending March 14, 2018, and have a term of four years.
In connection with Novelion’s business combination with Aegerion in 2016, Novelion entered into a secured loan facility with Aegerion (the “Senior Loan Agreement”). Since the consummation of the business combination, Aegerion has continued to borrow pursuant to the terms of the Senior Loan Agreement. In connection with the entry into the New Loan Agreement, on March 15, 2018, Aegerion and Novelion entered into an amended and restated senior secured term loan agreement (the “Amended and Restated Senior Loan Agreement”), which amends and restates the Senior Loan Agreement. The loans and interest paid in kind under the Amended and Restated Senior Loan Agreement (collectively, the “Senior Loan”) will continue to accrue interest at the rate of 8.0% per annum. Following an event of default and so long as an event of default is continuing, the interest rate would increase by 3.0% per annum. Interest will accrue and compound quarterly in arrears and is not to be payable in cash until July 1, 2019, the maturity date of the Senior Loan. The Senior Loan may be prepaid, in whole or in part, by Aegerion at any time without 
5

premium or penalty. As of March 15, 2018, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Senior Loan Agreement (and that will be outstanding under the Amended and Restated Senior Loan Agreement) was approximately $38.1 million, which includes all accrued interest paid in kind. 
Merger Transaction with Aegerion. On June 14, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Aegerion, pursuant to which on November 29, 2016 our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Isotope Acquisition Corp., merged with and into Aegerion, with Aegerion surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary. Upon completion of the Merger, on November 29, 2016, each outstanding share of Aegerion common stock was converted into a right to receive 1.0256 Novelion (pre-Consolidation) common shares and Aegerion’s common stock was cancelled and delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”).
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we also issued certain warrants to the pre-closing shareholders of Novelion. These warrants (the "Merger Agreement Warrants") were exercisable for up to an aggregate of 11,301,791 Novelion common shares at an exercise price of $0.05 per share if Aegerion's disclosed DOJ and SEC investigations or Aegerion’s Class Action Litigation were settled for amounts in excess of a certain negotiated threshold. Given that the settlements of these matters did not exceed the negotiated threshold, the Merger Agreement Warrants have been cancelled subsequent to December 31, 2017 and will not be exercisable for any shares. Refer to Note 13 - Share Capital in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further details.
The aggregate consideration delivered to the former holders of Aegerion common stock in connection with the Merger was approximately 6,060,288 Novelion common shares. Shareholders of Novelion immediately prior to the Merger, including the participants in the private placement pursuant to the Unit Subscription Agreement (described below), owned approximately 68% of the outstanding Novelion common shares upon completion of the Merger and stockholders of Aegerion immediately prior to the Merger owned approximately 32% of the outstanding Novelion common shares upon completion of the Merger.
Private Placement. Also on June 14, 2016, we entered into a unit subscription agreement (the "Unit Subscription Agreement") with the investors party thereto (the "Investors"). Pursuant to the Unit Subscription Agreement, immediately prior to the Merger, the Investors acquired units, for $8.80 per unit, on a post-Consolidation basis, consisting of (i) 2,472,727 Novelion common shares, which includes up to 568,181 Novelion common shares issuable upon exercise of fully paid-up warrants, and (ii) warrants (the "Unit Subscription Agreement Warrants") which were exercisable for up to an aggregate of 2,644,952 Novelion common shares at an exercise price of $0.05 per share on the same terms and conditions as the Merger Agreement Warrants (collectively with the Merger Agreement Warrants, the “Warrants”). As with the Merger Agreement Warrants, these warrants have been cancelled subsequent to December 31, 2017 because the settlements of the matters described above did not exceed the negotiated threshold. The aggregate consideration paid under the Unit Subscription Agreement was approximately $21.8 million.
Share Consolidation. On December 16, 2016, we completed a one-for-five (1:5) consolidation (the "Consolidation") of all of our issued and outstanding common shares, without par value, for shareholders of record as of December 16, 2016, resulting in a reduction in the issued and outstanding common shares from 92,653,562 to 18,530,323 as of that date. Each shareholder’s percentage ownership in Novelion and proportional voting power remained unchanged after the Consolidation, except for minor changes resulting from the treatment of fractional shares. In connection with the Consolidation, the conversion rate of the Convertible Notes was automatically adjusted from 24.9083 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of such Convertible Notes to 4.9817 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of such Convertible Notes.
Aralez Investment and Distribution. On December 7, 2015, QLT entered into an Amended and Restated Share Subscription Agreement (the "Amended and Restated Subscription Agreement") with Tribute Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. ("Tribute"), POZEN Inc. ("POZEN"), Aralez Pharmaceuticals plc, (formally known as Aguono Limited) ("Aralez Ireland") and certain other investors for the purpose of returning capital to QLT's shareholders in either Aralez Shares (approximately 0.13629 of an Aralez Share for each common share of the Company) or cash, subject to pro-ration (the "Aralez Distribution"), up to a maximum of $15.0 million funded pursuant to the terms of the Backstop Agreement as described below.
In connection with the Aralez Distribution, on June 8, 2015, QLT entered into a share purchase agreement (as amended, the "Backstop Agreement") with Broadfin Healthcare Master Fund, Ltd. ("Broadfin") and the JW Partners, LP, JW Opportunities Fund, LLC and JW Opportunities Master Fund, Ltd. (together the "JW Parties"), pursuant to which Broadfin and the JW Parties agreed to purchase up to $15.0 million of the Aralez Shares from QLT at $6.25 per share. This arrangement provided QLT’s shareholders with the opportunity to elect to receive, in lieu of Aralez Shares, up to an aggregate of $15.0 million in cash, subject to proration among the shareholders. 
Upon consummation of the merger of Tribute and POZEN (the "Aralez Merger") on February 5, 2016, we purchased 7,200,000 Aralez Shares (representing 10.1% of the issued and outstanding Aralez Shares), for an aggregate price of $45.0 million. We held the Aralez Shares from February 5, 2016 to April 5, 2016 (the "Distribution Date") and the Aralez Shares were marked-
6

to-market. As a result, we recognized a $10.7 million loss during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, to reflect the change in value from the acquisition date to the Distribution Date.
Terminated Merger Transaction. On June 8, 2015, QLT entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended and restated on each of July 16, 2015 and August 26, 2015) (the "InSite Merger Agreement") with InSite Vision Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("InSite"). On September 15, 2015, the InSite Merger Agreement was terminated by InSite and InSite paid QLT a termination fee of $2.7 million. Refer to Note 4 - Terminated Merger Transaction in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further details.
Marketed Products
As noted above, lomitapide and metreleptin are products that have been and continue to be developed and commercialized by our subsidiary Aegerion. All references to “we”, “us”, “our” and the like in this Annual Report in relation to lomitapide and metreleptin are references to the activities and plans of Aegerion or subsidiaries of Aegerion.
Lomitapide
Lomitapide, a small molecule microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ("MTP") inhibitor, or MTP-I, is currently approved and marketed in a number of countries, including the U.S., Japan, Israel, Canada, and Colombia, under the brand name JUXTAPID, and in the EU under the brand name LOJUXTA, as an adjunct to a low-fat diet and other lipid lowering treatments, to reduce LDL-C in adult patients with HoFH.
HoFH
HoFH is a serious, rare genetic disease that impairs the function of the receptor responsible for removing LDL-C (bad cholesterol) from the blood. An impairment of low density lipoprotein receptor ("LDL-R") function results in significant elevation of blood cholesterol levels.
Cholesterol is a naturally occurring molecule that is transported in the blood. The liver and the intestines are the two main sites where cholesterol is packaged and released within the body. The liver synthesizes cholesterol, and provides the body’s intrinsic supply. The intestines are the conduit through which cholesterol enters the body for metabolism. The delivery of cholesterol to peripheral cells in the body provides necessary sources of cellular energy and cell structure. However, excess levels of cholesterol in the blood, also known as hypercholesterolemia, can be the source of significant diseases in humans. HoFH is most commonly caused by genetic mutations in both alleles of the LDL-R gene, but can also be caused by mutations in other genes. To date, more than 1,700 mutations have been identified that can impair the function of the LDL-R gene, with some mutations leading to a total lack of LDL-R activity and others leading to significantly reduced activity in the LDL-R gene. As a result of elevated levels of LDL-C, HoFH patients very often develop premature and progressive atherosclerosis, a narrowing or blocking of the arteries (usually in combination with arterial thrombosis), and are at very high risk of experiencing premature cardiovascular events, such as heart attack or stroke.
There are no universally accepted criteria for the diagnosis of HoFH. Diagnosis is typically made clinically, using the following criteria:

• | significantly elevated LDL-C cholesterol levels (treated or untreated);


• | physical signs, which may include the presence of cutaneous xanthomas, Achilles tendon thickening, xanthelasma and/or corneal arcus;


• | limited response to statins that is not attributed to statin intolerance or to another identifiable cause (usually dependent on functional LDL receptors), or limited and/or inadequate response to a PCSK 9 inhibitor;


• | evidence of premature cardiovascular disease (often in the second and third decade of life); and


• | a positive history of high cholesterol and/or premature cardiovascular disease, consistent with having familial hypercholesterolemia ("FH") on both sides of the family.

HoFH is a rare form of FH and not all patients with the above characteristics will be HoFH patients. Genetic testing may be performed to make a diagnosis of HoFH, but is not routinely used in the U.S. because it has not been widely available, and because genetic testing can fail to detect certain defects given the large number of possible mutations and the number of genes 
7

that could be involved, as described above. HoFH patients may have the same defect on both copies of the same gene or may have different defects, one inherited from each parent, on the same gene or defects inherited from each parent on two different genes each affecting the function of the LDL-R. A 2013 article in the European Heart Journal ("EHJ"), as well as a 2015 article from the American Heart Association ("AHA"), estimate that current genetic tests may fail to positively detect 10% to 40% of patients with FH. As a result, most physicians in the U.S. and in many other countries use clinical findings and family history on both sides to make a clinical diagnosis of HoFH. Although not widely used, HoFH may also be diagnosed through an assessment of LDL-R function in cultured skin fibroblasts.
Physicians treating patients with hypercholesterolemia, including HoFH, are highly focused on lowering levels of LDL-C in their patients. In the U.S., for example, organizations such as the National Cholesterol Education Program ("NCEP"), the American Heart Association, and the American College of Cardiology have emphasized aggressive management of LDL-C. NCEP guidelines currently recommend that patients at high risk of experiencing a heart attack achieve LDL-C levels of 100 mg/dL or lower through lifestyle changes and drug therapy as appropriate based on their starting levels. International guidelines for adult patients at high risk of experiencing a heart attack, such as those published in the International Journal of Cardiology and the Canadian Journal of Cardiology, and guidelines published in the EHJ in 2014 ("2014 EHJ HoFH Guidelines") that are specific to HoFH and guidelines published by the Japan Atherosclerosis Society FH Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee in 2017 support LDL-C treatment targets for such patients as low as 70 mg/dL or lower. The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association released guidelines in 2013 for patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease caused by atherosclerosis that are focused first on lifestyle changes and statin therapy. The 2014 EHJ HoFH Guidelines made similar recommendations regarding lifestyle changes and statin therapy for the treatment of HoFH and also recommended the use of LDL apheresis, in which cholesterol is removed from the body through mechanical filtration, and the use of other adjunctive treatments, such as lomitapide and mipomersen, for HoFH patients who are within the indication for such products (adults for lomitapide). More recent guidance, such as “The Agenda for Familial Hypercholesterolemia: A Scientific Statement from the American Heart Association” in 2015, added PCSK9 inhibitor treatment for HoFH patients as a recommended treatment. In February 2017, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology published guidelines for management of dyslipidemia and prevention of atherosclerosis. Patients in this “extreme risk” category, including men aged 55 years and younger and women aged 65 years and younger who have established cardiovascular disease accompanied by familial hypercholesterolemia, have an LDL-C goal of <55 mg/dL.
The clinical approach taken with HoFH patients typically involves an aggressive treatment plan to reduce lipid levels as much as possible through dietary modifications and a combination of available lipid-lowering drug therapies. Current therapies approved for reducing LDL-C levels in HoFH patients include statins, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, PCSK9 inhibitors and JUXTAPID. With the introduction of PCSK9 inhibitors in the U.S. in 2015, healthcare professionals began trying most new adult HoFH patients on a PCSK9 inhibitor product before trying JUXTAPID, and switching some existing JUXTAPID patients to a PCSK9 inhibitor product, because such products, in comparison to JUXTAPID, have fewer side effects, are significantly less expensive, and do not require that patients follow a special low-fat diet. Because many of these therapies, including statins and PCSK9 inhibitor products, act by increasing the activity of LDL-R, HoFH patients, given their impaired LDL-R function, or lack of function, often have an inadequate response to standard therapies. For example, high dose statin therapies that typically produce 46% to 55% reductions in LDL-C levels in the broad hypercholesterolemic patient population, on average, produce a 10% to 25% reduction in patients with HoFH. Also, in a study published in the Lancet journal in 2015, PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab produced a mean reduction of LDL-C of 23% in HoFH patients at 12 weeks. However, a subset of HoFH patients with very low or no LDL-R function did not respond to evolocumab treatment. Patients with HoFH who are unable to reach their recommended target LDL-C levels on drug therapy are sometimes treated using LDL apheresis. Although levels of LDL-C are reduced using apheresis, there is a rapid rebound (usually after approximately four days). Because apheresis provides only temporary reductions in LDL-C levels, it must be repeated frequently. In addition, except in many countries in the EU, apheresis is not readily available, particularly in the U.S., due to the limited number of treatment centers that perform this procedure.
Status in the U.S. and the EU
In December 2012, the FDA approved JUXTAPID as an adjunct to a low-fat diet and other lipid-lowering treatments, including LDL apheresis where available, to reduce LDL-C, total cholesterol, apo B and non-HDL-C in adult patients with HoFH. Aegerion launched JUXTAPID in the U.S. in January 2013. The FDA has granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity from the date of approval for JUXTAPID in the U.S. in the treatment of HoFH, expiring in December 2019. The U.S. prescribing information for JUXTAPID specifies that the safety and effectiveness of lomitapide have not been established in patients with hypercholesterolemia who do not have HoFH, including those with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ("HeFH"), or in pediatric patients, and that the effect of lomitapide on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.
In July 2013, Aegerion received marketing authorization for LOJUXTA in the EU as an adjunct to a low-fat diet and other lipid-lowering medicinal products with or without LDL apheresis in adult patients with HoFH. Despite the prevalence rate, 
8

lomitapide does not have orphan medicinal product exclusivity in the EU for the treatment of HoFH because the EMA views the relevant condition, for orphan drug purposes, to include both HoFH and HeFH. The Summary of Product Characteristics ("SmPC") approved by the EC for LOJUXTA states that genetic confirmation of HoFH should be obtained whenever possible, and that other forms of primary hyperlipoproteinemia and secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia (e.g., nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism) must be excluded. The SmPC also specifies that the effect of lomitapide on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. Because Aegerion was unable to obtain commercially acceptable pricing and reimbursement approvals for LOJUXTA in several of the key markets of the EU, Aegerion elected to cease commercialization of LOJUXTA in the EU and, in December 2016, entered into a license agreement with Amryt under which Amryt was granted an exclusive right to develop and commercialize LOJUXTA in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), Switzerland, Turkey and certain Middle Eastern and North African territories, including Israel. Under the license agreement, Aegerion maintains the marketing authorizations for LOJUXTA; however, Amryt is responsible for ongoing regulatory and post-marketing obligations and commitments for LOJUXTA. Amryt is also required to pay Aegerion certain sales-related milestone payments and royalties on net product sales in the licensed territories.
The prescribing information for lomitapide in the U.S. and the EU warns physicians that lomitapide can cause hepatotoxicity as manifested by elevations in transaminases and increases in hepatic fat, and that physicians are recommended to measure alanine aminotransferase ("ALT"), aspartate aminotransferase ("AST"), alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin before initiating treatment and then to measure ALT and AST regularly during treatment. During the first year of treatment, physicians must conduct a liver-related test prior to each increase in the dose of lomitapide or monthly, whichever occurs first. After the first year, physicians are required to perform these tests every three months and before increases in dose. The prescribing information in the EU provides further recommendations for monitoring for hepatic steatohepatitis/fibrosis and the risk of progressive liver disease, including annual imaging for tissue elasticity, and measuring of biomarkers and/or scoring methods in consultation with a hepatologist.
Because of the risk of hepatotoxicity, JUXTAPID is available in the U.S. only through a REMS program, referred to as the JUXTAPID REMS program. The FDA approved significant modifications to the JUXTAPID REMS program on January 3, 2017 (which modifications have been implemented). The goal of the JUXTAPID REMS program, as modified, is to mitigate the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with the use of JUXTAPID by ensuring that: (a) prescribers are educated about the approved indication for JUXTAPID, the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with the use of JUXTAPID, and the need to monitor patients during treatment with JUXTAPID as per product labeling; (b) JUXTAPID is dispensed only to patients with a clinical or laboratory diagnosis consistent with HoFH; and (c) patients are informed about the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with the use of JUXTAPID and the need for baseline and periodic monitoring. The FDA’s approval letter for the modified REMS program also specified that an authorized generic drug under JUXTAPID’s New Drug Application ("NDA") must have an FDA-approved REMS program prior to marketing.
The originally approved JUXTAPID REMS program consisted of Elements To Assure Safe Use ("ETASU"), an implementation system, a communication plan and a timetable for submission of assessments of the JUXTAPID REMS program. It also required healthcare professionals who prescribe JUXTAPID and pharmacies that dispense JUXTAPID to be certified, and that JUXTAPID must only be dispensed to patients with evidence or other documentation of safe-use conditions. The ETASU in the modified JUXTAPID REMS program approved by the FDA on January 3, 2017 has been significantly enhanced and requires, among other things, that healthcare professionals and pharmacies complete a recertification process in order to continue prescribing and dispensing JUXTAPID; that healthcare professionals, once certified, counsel existing and new JUXTAPID patients on the goals of the JUXTAPID REMS program; and that healthcare professionals and their patients sign a form acknowledging that this counseling has taken place and that the patient understands the goals of the JUXTAPID REMS program. The modified JUXTAPID REMS program also requires that JUXTAPID prescriptions be written on an updated prescription authorization form. In order to prevent potential interruptions in therapy for existing JUXTAPID patients during the transition to the modified JUXTAPID REMS program, the FDA granted a 180-day extension to the original deadline, to December 28, 2017, for existing patients receiving therapy with JUXTAPID. This extension process allowed for existing JUXTAPID patients to continue to receive therapy with JUXTAPID while their prescriber completed recertification and conducted the patient counseling component of the JUXTAPID REMS program.
We have completed the implementation of the modifications to the JUXTAPID REMS program, including the requirements concerning recertification of current JUXTAPID prescribers and pharmacies and completion of the new patient prescriber acknowledgment form and new prescription authorization form for each existing and new JUXTAPID patient. However, we may lose JUXTAPID patients temporarily or permanently, or add new adult HoFH patients at a slower than expected pace, as a result of the enhancements to the modified JUXTAPID REMS program, as described above, for a variety of reasons, including: the inability to certify healthcare professionals who may want to put new patients on JUXTAPID, on a timely basis or at all; the failure of new healthcare professionals and/or new patients to meet the patient counseling requirements and sign and submit the patient acknowledgment form, as required, on a timely basis or at all; and that the enhanced education concerning the goals of the JUXTAPID REMS program, and related documentation, may cause healthcare professionals to stop or delay treatment with 
9

JUXTAPID, or try alternative therapies for adult HoFH patients before starting or continuing JUXTAPID treatment. Any failure to comply with the pending consent decree that Aegerion entered into with the FDA related to the JUXTAPID REMS program as part of the settlement of the SEC and DOJ investigations may also have an effect on the FDA’s requirements for the JUXTAPID REMS program.
Similarly, in the EU, we have adopted risk management plans to help educate physicians on the safety information for LOJUXTA and appropriate precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients.
Status outside the U.S. and the EU
In September 2016, JUXTAPID was approved by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare ("MHLW") in Japan for patients with HoFH. Approval in Japan was based on a Phase 3 study we conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of JUXTAPID to reduce LDL-C levels in nine adult Japanese HoFH patients. The results of the Phase 3 study were consistent with the known safety and efficacy profile of JUXTAPID. In November 2016, the MHLW approved pricing of JUXTAPID and in December 2016 we launched JUXTAPID in Japan. HoFH is listed as an intractable disease in Japan, and as part of that designation, reimbursement is mandated and patients register with the government to receive comprehensive treatment benefits, including apheresis. According to the 2014 MHLW Japanese Intractable Diseases Information Centers Listing, there are approximately 160 patients registered as diagnosed with HoFH in Japan. JUXTAPID has received orphan drug designation in the treatment of HoFH from the MHLW, which provides ten years of exclusivity. In April 2017, JUXTAPID was approved by Argentina’s National Administration of Drugs, Foods and Medical Devices ("ANMAT") for patients with HoFH, and we plan to launch JUXTAPID in Argentina in 2018.
Lomitapide has also been approved as an adjunct treatment for adult patients with HoFH in other countries outside the U.S. and EU, including Colombia, Mexico, Canada, Israel, Argentina, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Taiwan and South Korea. INVIMA, the regulatory agency responsible for reviewing marketing authorization applications in Colombia, has also granted JUXTAPID five years of post-approval data exclusivity. The indications and prescribing information, including risk information, for lomitapide in these countries are generally comparable to those in the U.S.
Lomitapide is subject to risk management plans in each country in which it is approved outside the U.S. and the EU, except Israel, and such plans require the approval of regulatory authorities prior to reimbursement approval and marketing. The goal of the risk management plans is to help educate physicians on the safety information for lomitapide and appropriate precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients.
We plan to file for marketing approval of lomitapide in Brazil in 2018. A regulation was approved in Brazil in December 2017 providing for special procedures concerning the registration of new drugs for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases; we are assessing the expected impact of this regulation on our expected submissions for marketing approval of our products in Brazil. We may also file for marketing approval in other countries where, in light of the potential size of the market and other relevant commercial and regulatory factors, it makes business sense to do so. To obtain marketing approval and commercialize JUXTAPID where approved, we must establish, and comply with, numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, pricing, promotion and distribution of the respective product.
We are also making lomitapide available in certain countries that allow use of a drug, on a named patient basis or under a compassionate use or other type of so-called expanded access program, before marketing approval has been obtained in such country. We charge for lomitapide for authorized pre-approval uses in some of the countries where it is available under an expanded access program, to the extent permitted by applicable law and local regulatory authorities. In 2017, the substantial majority of our revenues from named patient sales of lomitapide were derived from orders from Brazil, where patients have the right to bring legal action through the judicial system to seek access to unapproved drugs for which there are no therapeutic alternatives. We are also generating, or expect to generate, revenues from sales of lomitapide in several other countries on a named patient sales basis in the near-term. In some countries, including Brazil, orders for lomitapide on a named patient sales basis are for multiple patients and multiple months of therapy. We expect net product sales from named patient sales of lomitapide to fluctuate significantly quarter-over-quarter given that orders for named patient sales are typically for multiple months of therapy which can lead to fluctuation depending on the ordering pattern, government actions, including the ongoing investigations in Brazil, economic pressures and political unrest. In addition, the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court is currently discussing, in two ongoing lawsuits (unrelated to us), whether the government has an obligation to continue to provide, on a named patient sales basis, drugs that have not received regulatory and/or pricing and reimbursement approval in Brazil, such as lomitapide and metreleptin. Further, in October 2017, a new set of regulatory requirements governing products supplied on a named patient sales basis was published in Brazil, which has added complexity to the process for the purchase, on a named patient basis, of drugs which have not received regulatory and/or pricing and reimbursement approval in Brazil, such as lomitapide and metreleptin, which has, along with the ongoing court proceeding, resulted in delays in the receipt of orders from Brazil for existing lomitapide and metreleptin patients 
10

and we believe has led certain patients to discontinue therapy with our products. The result of the court proceeding, ongoing state and federal government investigations, a 2016 decision by the Brazilian pharmaceutical industry association that we violated its Code of Conduct, and negative coverage by Brazilian media could continue to significantly negatively affect product revenues from named patient sales of our products in Brazil. In certain countries where we charge for lomitapide during the pre-approval phase, we are able to establish the price for lomitapide, while in other countries we need to negotiate the price. In certain countries or under certain circumstances, we are providing lomitapide free of charge for permitted pre-approval uses and to the extent permitted by applicable law and local regulatory agencies.
Clinical Development and Post-Marketing Commitments
As part of our post-marketing commitments to the FDA for lomitapide, we completed a juvenile toxicology study in rodents to ascertain the impact, if any, of lomitapide on growth and development prior to initiating a clinical study of lomitapide in pediatric HoFH patients, and have submitted the results of this study to the FDA. In the first quarter of 2015, the FDA issued a Written Request for a study to evaluate lomitapide in pediatric HoFH patients, which, if completed as described, would provide for six months of pediatric exclusivity under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"). In the second quarter of 2015, Aegerion decided to decline the FDA’s Written Request regarding its planned study in pediatric HoFH patients, because it believed that the size and complexity of the requested trial created a considerable barrier to the feasibility of the study. Given that we have declined to conduct the study requested by the FDA, we will not be entitled to the six months of additional exclusivity available for conducting a study that is the subject of a Written Request issued by the FDA.
As part of Aegerion’s post-marketing commitments to both the FDA and the EMA for lomitapide, we initiated an observational cohort study in 2014 to generate additional data on the long-term safety profile of lomitapide, the patterns of use and compliance and the long-term effectiveness of lomitapide in controlling LDL-C levels. Our commitment to the FDA is to target enrollment of 300 HoFH patients worldwide, and to study enrolled patients for a period of ten years. The EMA has required that all patients taking lomitapide in the EU be encouraged to participate in the study, and that the study period be open-ended. In connection with the license agreement with Amryt in December 2016, Amryt agreed to bear the costs of conducting this study in the EEA and other relevant territories. In the study, investigators will follow each patient to track malignancies, tumors, teratogenicity, hepatic effects, and gastrointestinal adverse reactions, events associated with coagulopathy, major adverse cardiovascular events and death. The EMA also required that a vascular imaging study be conducted to determine the impact of lomitapide on vascular endpoints, which Aegerion initiated in 2014 and is now the responsibility of Amryt pursuant to our license agreement with Amryt. In addition, we have completed certain drug-drug interactions studies and submitted the results to the EMA.
Phase 3 Clinical Study
Our Phase 3 clinical study of lomitapide evaluated the safety and effectiveness of lomitapide to reduce LDL-C levels in 29 adult patients with HoFH. The study was a multinational, single-arm, open-label, 78-week trial.
In the Phase 3 study, each patient’s background lipid-lowering therapies were stabilized during a six-week run-in phase prior to dosing, and were maintained through at least the end of the 26-week efficacy phase. When added to the existing lipid-lowering therapy of the HoFH patients in the study, lomitapide reduced LDL-C by an average of 40% at week 26 in the intent-to-treat population with last observation carried forward for the patients who discontinued prematurely, and reduced LDL-C by an average of 50% for the 23 patients who completed the study through week 26. Also, approximately 65% of all patients completing the study experienced LDL-C reductions of 50% to 93% from their baseline as measured at the end of week 26. After week 26, during the 52-week safety phase of the study, adjustments to concomitant lipid-lowering treatments were allowed. Average reductions in LDL-C were sustained during chronic therapy.
The most common adverse reactions in the Phase 3 study were gastrointestinal, reported by 27 (93%) of 29 patients. Adverse reactions, reported by greater than or equal to eight patients (28%) in the HoFH clinical trial, included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia and abdominal pain. Other common adverse reactions, reported by five to seven (17-24%) patients, included weight loss, abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension, constipation, flatulence, increased ALT, chest pain, influenza, nasopharyngitis, and fatigue. Elevations in liver enzymes and hepatic (liver) fat were also observed. Ten of the 29 patients in the study had at least one elevation in liver enzymes greater than or equal to three times the upper limit of normal ("ULN"), including four patients who experienced liver enzymes greater than or equal to five times the ULN. During the clinical trial, liver enzyme elevations were managed through dose reduction or temporary discontinuation of dose. There were no clinically meaningful elevations of total bilirubin, international normalized ratio or alkaline phosphatase, which are other markers of potential harmful effects on the liver. Hepatic fat increased from a baseline of 1% to a median absolute increase of 6% at 26 and 78 weeks.
11

Nineteen of 23 patients who completed the 78-week pivotal study entered a Phase 3 long-term extension study, and continued lomitapide at their individualized maintenance dose, with 17 (89%) completing 126 weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint of the extension study was mean percent change in LDL-C from the patient’s baseline, measured at the start of the original pivotal trial, to week 126. In the extension study, mean LDL-C levels were reduced by 45.5% from baseline at week 126. Similar mean percent reductions were observed for apo B, non-HDL-C, and total cholesterol. The adverse reaction profile observed in the extension study was consistent with that observed during the pivotal trial.
Estimated Prevalence of HoFH
There is no patient registry or other method of establishing with precision the actual number of patients with HoFH in any geography. Medical literature has historically reported the prevalence rate of HoFH as one person in 1,000,000, based on an estimated prevalence rate for HeFH of one person in 500. Analysis of HoFH prevalence has been evolving in recent years culminating in published medical literature that suggests that the actual prevalence of both HeFH and HoFH may be significantly higher than the historical estimates. For example, in 2014, the European Atherosclerosis Society ("EAS") Consensus Panel on FH published an article citing research that would result in an estimate of the prevalence of HoFH in the range of between one person in 300,000 and one person in 160,000 or 3.33 persons per million to 6.25 persons per million, which is consistent with estimates that can be derived from other publications from the last few years. The FDA cited this estimate in its review of PCSK9 inhibitor products in June 2015. There is no guarantee that the prevalence of HoFH is higher than, or even as high as, the current medical literature suggests or is even higher than reported in the historical literature. Given that JUXTAPID is a last-line treatment for adult HoFH patients, the market for JUXTAPID may be significantly smaller than the prevalence of HoFH suggested by current and historical medical literature.
We believe that the prevalence rate of HoFH in countries outside the U.S. is likely to be consistent with the prevalence rate in the U.S.; however, we expect that our net product sales in countries outside the U.S. are likely to be lower than in the U.S. given the pricing and reimbursement process and approval levels in such countries compared to the U.S. and significant political and economic pressures to reduce healthcare costs in certain ex-U.S. countries, resulting in lower approved prices, pricing controls, reimbursement restrictions and caps on patients treated and/or drug expenditures, the more widespread availability of apheresis, in certain countries, like Japan, and the possibility that genotyping may be required in some countries, reducing the number of patients diagnosed with HoFH.
Metreleptin
Metreleptin, a recombinant analog of human leptin, is marketed in the U.S. under the brand name MYALEPT. MYALEPT is approved in the U.S. as an adjunct to diet as replacement therapy to treat the complications of leptin deficiency in patients with congenital or acquired GL. In December 2016, we submitted an MAA to the EMA to seek approval for metreleptin in the EU, under the brand name MYALEPTA, as replacement therapy to treat complications of leptin deficiency in patients with GL and in a subset of patients with PL. In January 2018, we submitted our responses to questions raised by the EMA in its Day 180 list of questions, and in February 2018, we presented at an oral hearing of the CHMP. Based on the CHMP’s feedback at and after the hearing, we have requested a two-month “clock stop” of the CHMP’s review to allow for the preparation of responses and additional data focused, primarily, on the PL patient subset. Subject to our ability to address the CHMP’s feedback during the “clock stop” period, we anticipate that the CHMP will issue its opinion in the second quarter of 2018 and the EC will issue its decision in mid-2018.

Leptin was initially discovered in 1994, and in the over two decades since, the role of leptin in human physiology has been further studied and understood. In addition to its central role in the regulation of energy homeostasis and glucose and fat metabolism, leptin has diverse effects on various physiologic functions, including the regulation of neuroendocrine function, reproduction, vascular function, bone metabolism, and the immune system. We plan to initiate, by late 2018, a phase 2 trial assessing metreleptin in HMD, subject to approval of our protocol and statistical plan by applicable regulatory authorities. We also plan to continue to explore new opportunities for metreleptin to treat certain other low-leptin mediated metabolic diseases, and are reviewing options for raising capital to fund such opportunities, along with later-stage studies in HMD, upon which such opportunities are largely dependent.
Lipodystrophy
Lipodystrophy is a heterogeneous group of rare syndromes characterized by selective but variable loss of fat tissue. The loss of fat tissue in patients with lipodystrophy can range from partial to more generalized, and some patients have concomitant accumulation of excess fat tissue centrally. Because of the loss of fat tissue, levels of the fat cell secreted hormone leptin are very low. Leptin is a naturally occurring hormone derived from fat cells and an important regulator of energy, fat and glucose metabolism, 
12

reproductive capacity, and other physiological functions. Circulating levels of leptin closely correlate with the amount of fat mass present.
Due to the lack of fat cells in individuals with lipodystrophy, energy can no longer be stored as fat in adipose tissues (fat cells) and fat accumulates in the muscles and organs such as the heart, liver, and pancreas causing lipotoxicity and end-organ damage. In addition, deposition of fat in these unusual locations leads to extreme insulin resistance and its associated complications, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and high blood pressure. These severe metabolic abnormalities are typically resistant to conventional therapies. As a result of the deficiency of leptin associated with lipodystrophy, patients experience significant fatigue as well as unregulated appetite. The voracious appetite itself significantly aggravates the metabolic abnormalities that these patients have, and further reduces the ability to successfully treat these metabolic abnormalities with conventional therapies.
Generalized Lipodystrophy
GL is characterized by a near complete lack of adipose tissue and, consequently, leads to early and significant morbidity and mortality. Differentiation of GL (versus PL) is made based on the anatomical distribution of fat loss, which is widespread in GL patients, and the younger age and greater rapidity of onset and severity of the metabolic abnormalities. The severe metabolic abnormalities associated with GL may result in premature diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, cardiomyopathy, recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis, hepatomegaly, and organ failure. These complications themselves increase morbidity and mortality due to their known long-term impacts.
Partial Lipodystrophy
PL is characterized by a less uniform loss of fat cells and with a later age of onset. There can be considerable heterogeneity in the extent of fat cell loss, levels of leptin, and degree of metabolic abnormalities. Within the spectrum of PL, there are a subset of patients with more severe disease presentation. In PL patients with relative or near complete leptin deficiency, the metabolic abnormalities and longer impact on disease progression can closely mirror that of patients with GL.
We have defined a subset of patients with PL who have clinically similar metabolic disturbances as those patients with GL and who demonstrated clinically significant improvements in metabolic parameters on metreleptin treatment in clinical studies. See Phase 3 Clinical Studies below. Specifically, this subset includes patients with lower leptin levels, and more advanced metabolic abnormalities. 
Status in the U.S.
The FDA approved MYALEPT in February 2014, as an adjunct to diet as replacement therapy to treat the complications of leptin deficiency in patients with congenital or acquired GL. The U.S. prescribing information for MYALEPT specifies that the safety and effectiveness of MYALEPT for the treatment of complications of PL or for the treatment of liver disease, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ("NASH"), have not been established. MYALEPT is not indicated for use in patients with HIV-related lipodystrophy or in patients with metabolic disease without concurrent evidence of congenital or acquired GL.
MYALEPT has a boxed warning, citing the risk of anti-metreleptin antibodies with neutralizing activity and the risk of lymphoma. The consequences of neutralizing antibodies are not well characterized but could reduce how well the leptin found naturally in the body works or how well MYALEPT works. Lymphoma has been observed in acquired forms of lipodystrophy with or without metreleptin therapy. Since patients with acquired lipodystrophy typically have underlying autoimmune conditions that may predispose them to risk of lymphoma, a causal link to the use of metreleptin has not been established.
Because of the risk of neutralizing antibodies and the risk of lymphoma, MYALEPT is available in the U.S. only through a restricted program under a REMS program (referred to as the MYALEPT REMS program). Under the MYALEPT REMS program, we certify all qualified healthcare providers who prescribe MYALEPT and the pharmacies that dispense the medicine. The goals of the MYALEPT REMS program are to:

• | educate prescribers about the risk of neutralizing antibodies and the risk of lymphoma associated with the use of MYALEPT; and


• | restrict access to therapy with MYALEPT to patients with a clinical diagnosis consistent with GL.

In May 2017, we received feedback from the FDA that a prospective placebo-controlled study will be required to support a marketing application in the U.S. for the use of metreleptin to treat a subset of the PL indication, and we are evaluating next 
13

steps. The FDA has granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity for MYALEPT in the U.S. in the treatment of metabolic disorders secondary to lipodystrophy.
Status outside the U.S.
MYALEPT is currently approved only in the U.S. and Japan. Pursuant to an existing distribution agreement assigned to Aegerion as part of its purchase of metreleptin rights, Shionogi & Co., Ltd. ("Shionogi") has rights to market metreleptin in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Shionogi received marketing and manufacturing approval in Japan for metreleptin for lipodystrophy in March 2013.
There are currently no approved treatments for GL or PL in the EU. In December 2016, we filed an MAA with the EMA seeking approval for metreleptin as replacement therapy to treat complications of leptin deficiency in patients with GL and in a subset of patients with PL. If approved, metreleptin would be marketed in the EU under the brand name of MYALEPTA. Metreleptin was granted orphan designation by the EC for the treatment of Barraquer-Simons syndrome ("acquired PL"), Berardinelli-Seip syndrome ("congenital GL"), Lawrence syndrome ("acquired GL") and familial PL.
We also plan to file for regulatory approvals for metreleptin in GL and, subject largely to whether we receive EMA approval of any PL subset indication, such PL subset in other key markets, including Brazil in late 2018. In December 2017, a regulation was approved in Brazil providing for special procedures concerning the registration of new drugs for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases; we are assessing the expected impact of this regulation on our expected submissions for marketing approval of our products in Brazil.
When Aegerion acquired metreleptin from AstraZeneca in January 2015, a number of patients were receiving metreleptin therapy free of charge in certain countries outside the U.S. that allow use of a drug, under a compassionate use or other type of expanded access program, before marketing approval has been obtained in such country. Where permitted in accordance with applicable requirements, we have continued to make metreleptin available free of charge under such program, which has resulted in significant costs to us, given that we have more than 100 patients participating in this program; many of these patients are GL and PL subset patients who will be eligible for paid commercial therapy if we obtain regulatory, pricing and reimbursement approvals in the EU for metreleptin. In 2016, we began generating revenues from named patient sales of metreleptin in certain markets where such sales of metreleptin are possible and to the extent permitted by applicable law and local regulatory authorities. In particular, we are in the process of converting GL and PL patients currently in the expanded access program in France to a paid program of Autorisation Temporaire d’Utilisation (Temporary Authorization for Use). Metreleptin has also been approved for reimbursement by the Turkish Social Security Association ("SGK"), and we are providing metreleptin on a named patient basis there for GL patients, including congenital GL patients, and other subsets of lipodystrophy patients, including patients with congenital leptin deficiency, subject to individual assessment in response to unsolicited requests from clinicians. Further, we now supply paid product for individual patients in certain other markets and anticipate that further unsolicited requests from clinicians may follow in these countries and potentially other selected markets in the EU where there is a formal mechanism for named patient sales in place. 
Outside of the EU, we have named patients sales of metreleptin in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and certain other markets. We expect net product sales from named patient sales of metreleptin to fluctuate significantly quarter-over-quarter given that orders for named patient sales are typically for multiple months of therapy which can lead to fluctuation depending on the ordering pattern, government actions, including the ongoing investigations in Brazil, economic pressures and political unrest. The result of the ongoing proceeding before the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court concerning the government’s obligation to provide drugs on a named patient sales basis, the ongoing state and federal government investigations into Aegerion’s activities in Brazil, a 2016 decision by the Brazilian pharmaceutical industry association that we violated its Code of Conduct, and negative coverage by Brazilian media could continue to significantly negatively affect product revenues in Brazil.
Phase 3 Clinical Study
The safety and efficacy of metreleptin for the treatment of metabolic disorders associated with lipodystrophy syndromes in pediatric and adult patients were evaluated in a long-term, open-label, single-arm study conducted at the National Institutes of Health (the "NIH"). The objective of the NIH trial was to evaluate the efficacy of metreleptin for improving metabolic disorders associated with acquired or inherited lipodystrophy. This investigator-sponsored study was initiated in August 2000.
A total of 107 patients (>= 6 months of age) with a clinical diagnosis of GL or PL, low baseline leptin levels (men < 8 ng/mL, women < 12 ng/mL), and at least one metabolic abnormality (diabetes mellitus, hypertriglyceridemia > 200 mg/dL, fasting insulin levels > 30µU/mL) were enrolled in the NIH study. A total of 66 of the 107 patients had GL and 41 had PL, including 31 patients who were included in the PL subgroup of the studied patients, and who constitute the “PL subset” described in our MAA 
14

currently being assessed by the EMA, i.e. those PL patients who have similar metabolic disturbances as patients with GL and who were defined as patients with baseline Hemoglobin A1c ("HbA1c") ≥6.5% and/or triglycerides ≥5.65 mmol/L. Given that the MAA review is ongoing, the PL indication, if approved by the EMA, may be distinct from the PL subset described in our MAA. Among the 66 patients with GL, 45 (68%) had congenital GL and 21 (32%) had acquired GL. Most patients in the PL subgroup had familial PL (27 patients, 87%); four patients (13%) had acquired PL.
Metreleptin was administered subcutaneously once or twice daily in a gender-dependent, weight-based protocol, with step-wise specified titration over the first two months of the study and subsequent dose adjustments based on clinical response. The co-primary efficacy endpoints in the NIH study were defined as:

• | Actual change from baseline in HbA1c at month 12, and


• | Percent change from baseline in fasting serum triglycerides at month 12.

Treatment with metreleptin led to substantial and sustained improvements in glycemic control and hypertriglyceridemia in patients with GL and in the PL subgroup.
The observed primary efficacy results in GL patients are as follows:

• | A mean change from baseline to month 12 in HbA1c of -2.2%.


• | A mean percent change from baseline to month 12 in triglycerides of -32.1%. The observed primary efficacy results in PL subgroup patients are as follows:


• | A mean change from baseline to month 12 in HbA1c of -0.9%; and


• | A mean percent change from baseline to month 12 in triglycerides of -37.4%.

In general, changes in fasting plasma glucose followed a similar pattern to changes in HbA1c.
Patients who met target decreases in both parameters were also assessed. In the GL group, 55% of patients achieved both an actual decrease in HbA1c of ≥1% and a ≥30% reduction in triglycerides at month 12; with over one-third of patients achieving the highest target reductions of a ≥2% actual decrease in HbA1c and a ≥40% reduction in triglycerides. These levels of reduction in baseline metabolic abnormalities were also observed in patients in the PL subgroup. In this subgroup, 30% of patients achieved both an actual decrease in HbA1c of ≥1% and a ≥30% reduction in triglycerides at month 12. Based on the overall mixed-model repeated measures analysis, which evaluates average levels of HbA1c and triglycerides across all visits, statistically significant decreases in HbA1c from baseline over all analysis visits was observed in the GL group and in the PL subgroup.
Median overall duration of metreleptin treatment was 49.9 months and 29.3 months in GL patients and in PL subgroup patients, respectively.
The most common adverse drug reactions ("ADRs") occurring in GL patients were weight decrease (reported by fifteen patients; 22.7%) and hypoglycemia (reported by eight patients; 12.1%), followed by decreased appetite, fatigue and neutralizing antibodies (each reported by four patients; 6.1%). The most common ADRs occurring in PL subgroup patients were hypoglycemia and fatigue (each reported by three patients; 9.7%), followed by alopecia (reported by two patients; 6.5%). Over the 14-year study duration, treatment-emergent deaths were reported in 4 (4%) of the 107 patients; treatment-emergent adverse events leading to death were consistent with the underlying morbidity of lipodystrophy and included renal failure, cardiac arrest (with pancreatitis and septic shock), progressive end-stage liver disease (chronic hepatic failure), and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. None of the deaths was assessed as drug-related.
The presence of neutralizing antibodies in a small minority of patients did not result in clearly identified clinical sequelae. Two cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma and one case of a localized anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (a type of T-cell lymphoma) were reported, all in patients with acquired GL. Lymphoma is known to be associated with autoimmune disease. As the boxed warning for MYALEPT states, T-cell lymphoma has been reported in patients with acquired GL, both treated and not treated with MYALEPT. There was evidence of pre-existing lymphoma and/or bone marrow/hematologic abnormalities in the two patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma prior to metreleptin therapy, and the third case of anaplastic large cell lymphoma occurred in the context of a specific chromosomal translocation.

Clinical Development and Post-Marketing Commitments
As part of the post-marketing commitments to the FDA for metreleptin, we have initiated a long-term, prospective, observational study (product exposure registry) in patients to evaluate serious risks related to the use of the product. The registry will attempt to enroll at least 100 new patients treated with metreleptin. Enrollment will close after five years or after 100 new patients have been enrolled, whichever occurs first. The registry will continue for ten years from the date of last patient’s enrollment. We have also committed to the EMA, as part of our pediatric investigation plan ("PIP"), to conduct a study in GL patients under six years old to further evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of metreleptin in this pediatric sub-population. In connection with the ongoing review of the metreleptin MAA and its expected approval, we anticipate the conduct of the following studies: a non-interventional, prospective, observational study (product exposure registry) of GL and PL subset patients initiating treatment with metreleptin, a post-approval efficacy study ("PAES") in PL patients, an in vitro study to assess the binding of metreleptin to proteins in serum, and a non-clinical tissue distribution study. 
In addition, three programs are expected to expand the understanding of the immunogenicity of metreleptin. These programs consist of:

• | the development, validation, and implementation of a ligand binding assay to supplement the neutralizing bioassay that tests for the presence of neutralizing antibodies in serum samples from patients with GL, which we have completed;


• | testing all banked clinical samples from the GL clinical program for the presence of neutralizing antibodies against leptin using the ligand binding assay and to correlate neutralizing antibodies with clinical events, which we have completed and regarding which we are awaiting feedback from the FDA; and


• | a prospective study to assess the immunogenicity of metreleptin in patients receiving metreleptin, which is in the planning phase and which we expect to initiate in 2018.

The presence of neutralizing antibodies will be assessed using both a validated cell-based assay and a validated ligand-binding assay in samples that are confirmed positive for binding antibodies to leptin. In addition, we are required to conduct certain studies related to the manufacture of metreleptin, including in order to validate new test methods, implement a risk-based reference standard program approach, and reassess product acceptance criteria with a larger data set from more manufactured batches. The three post-marketing commitments related to manufacturing metreleptin are completed or are on track for completion by their respective commitment deadlines. Finally, we have an ongoing commitment to assess spontaneous reports of serious risks related to the use of metreleptin, including the risk to exposed pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes, regardless of indication, for ten years from the date of approval of metreleptin in the U.S.
Estimated Prevalence of GL and PL
There is no patient registry or other method of establishing with precision the actual number of patients with GL and PL in any geography. The data to date suggest that the approximate prevalence of GL in the U.S. is slightly under one in 1,000,000 persons and for PL overall is three in 1,000,000 persons. Although the data are even more limited, the prevalence in the U.S. of a subset of more severe PL, one that is comparable to the PL subset indication that we included in our MAA, is estimated to be between approximately 0.5 and one in 1,000,000 persons. We believe that the prevalence rate of GL and PL, and correspondingly the PL subset, in countries outside the U.S. is likely to be consistent with the prevalence rate in the U.S. There is no guarantee, however, that our estimates are correct. The actual prevalence of GL, PL and the PL subset may be significantly lower than we expect. Ultimately, the actual size of the total addressable market in the U.S. and other key markets where metreleptin is sold, if approved, will be better understood only after we have substantial commercial history selling metreleptin.
Clinical Development
We plan to initiate, in late 2018, a phase 2 trial assessing metreleptin in HMD, subject to approval of our protocol and statistical plan by applicable regulatory authorities. We also plan to continue to explore new opportunities for metreleptin to treat certain other low-leptin mediated metabolic diseases, and are reviewing options for raising capital to fund such opportunities, along with later-stage studies in HMD, upon which such opportunities are largely dependent.
Commercialization and Patient Support
We market and sell JUXTAPID and MYALEPT through our Aegerion subsidiary. We believe that the key priorities for the successful commercialization of our products in the countries in which we have received marketing approval, and the preparation for commercialization in the countries in which our products may be approved, include:
16


• | commercializing JUXTAPID and MYALEPT in the U.S. with a full-time employed sales force that leverages claims data analysis and other information to help identify potential GL and adult HoFH patients; and reorganizing and realigning our sales and medical organizations in support of key centers of excellence for both JUXTAPID and MYALEPT;


• | educating and training healthcare providers about our products and the diseases they are approved to treat, including educating healthcare providers about JUXTAPID as a last-line treatment for adult HoFH patients in the U.S. after use of PCSK9 inhibitor products, which products have continued to have an adverse impact on long-term use of, and new prescriptions for, JUXTAPID; and gaining market acceptance in the other countries, including Japan, where lomitapide is approved and being commercialized, or may in the future receive approval and be commercialized;


• | continuing to support patient access to and reimbursement for our products in the U.S. without significant restrictions, particularly given the availability of PCSK9 inhibitor products in the U.S., which has adversely impacted reimbursement of JUXTAPID, and given the considerable number of eligible JUXTAPID patients in the U.S. who are on Medicare Part D and the significant percentage of such patients who may not be able to afford their out-of-pocket co-payments for our products, given that prior sources of financial support for some of the patients through patient assistance programs operated by independent charitable 501(c)(3) organizations may no longer be available;


• | gaining regulatory, pricing and reimbursement approvals to market our products in countries in which the products are not currently approved and/or reimbursed or for new indications, including obtaining approval of the MAA seeking marketing approval of metreleptin in the EU as a treatment for complications of leptin deficiency in GL patients and a subset of PL patients; and


• | minimizing the number of patients who are eligible to receive but decide not to commence treatment with our products, or who discontinue treatment, by supporting activities such as patient support programs, to the extent permitted in a particular country.

The principal goals of our commercial strategy are to stabilize the number of patients on JUXTAPID, to support current and future potential for incremental sales of JUXTAPID and to grow sales of MYALEPT in the U.S., as well as prepare for launch in other jurisdictions in which we have submitted for approval of our products, such as MYALEPTA in the EU, if approved for sale.
In 2017, our commercial organization in the U.S. included a small contract sales force. In January 2018, we converted the contract sales force to full-time employees to create a full-time employee-based sales team. This team operates in four regions to educate and train healthcare providers who treat adult HoFH and GL patients about the safety and efficacy of JUXTAPID or MYALEPT, as applicable. The most frequent physician call points for our products are endocrinologists (including pediatric endocrinologists, with respect to MYALEPT), lipidologists, and cardiologists. We also implemented the use of de-identified claims data to more precisely target physicians who may have recently treated patients with adult HoFH or GL.
Outside the U.S., we mainly use country managers to market and sell our products where they are approved. In Japan, we sell JUXTAPID through a small contract sales force which is overseen by our country manager. The rights to commercialize LOJUXTA in the EU and certain other jurisdictions were out-licensed to Amryt in December 2016. In certain other countries outside the U.S., we have engaged, or plan to engage local distributors to conduct permitted commercial and pre-approval activities.
We also have a small marketing team that, along with third-party contractors, support our commercialization and disease awareness efforts in the countries in which our products are approved, and permitted educational and disease awareness activities in other parts of the world where we do business.
Another key aspect of our commercialization efforts is obtaining market access for our products, which primarily represents securing pricing and reimbursement approvals on acceptable levels, without the imposition of significant restrictions, such as caps, significant step edits or other similar measures, from private and government payers where our products are approved. In the U.S., we have a small team that supports our market access initiatives, which is primarily responsible for working with insurance plans, health maintenance organizations and other payers on securing reimbursement and formulary status for JUXTAPID and MYALEPT. This team also focuses on anticipating authorization and reauthorization requirements and educating physicians and office staff regarding criteria to continue coverage for our products. Outside the U.S., we support this effort primarily through the work of country managers and local third-party consultants. One of our main market access objectives, which is conducted in conjunction with our medical and health economics teams, is to strengthen the value proposition for JUXTAPID and MYALEPT for payers through the generation of critical market access studies to enhance patient, physician and payer knowledge of GL, HoFH, and, subject to approval in the EU, the PL subset and the real-world burden of these diseases. 
17

We believe the pricing for our products in the U.S. is consistent with the level of pricing for other rare orphan drugs that treat diseases with comparable prevalence rates. The majority of payers in the U.S. are providing coverage for our products, and with respect to JUXTAPID, most payers in the U.S. have not required genotyping. Many payers in the U.S. have, however, imposed requirements, conditions or limitations as conditions to coverage and reimbursement for JUXTAPID as a result of the commercial availability of PCSK9 inhibitor products, which often include a requirement that HoFH patients have not achieved an adequate LDL-C response on PCSK9 inhibitor products before access to JUXTAPID is approved. For patients currently taking JUXTAPID, several U.S. pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs") are using prior authorization requiring current JUXTAPID patients to “step through” the less expensive PCSK9 inhibitor product, and additional PBMs and payers may follow this practice. For MYALEPT, some U.S. payers require additional information, such as a leptin level test for patients, which may delay or otherwise impact reimbursement. The cost of JUXTAPID and MYALEPT in the U.S. may result in co-pay amounts for some patients that are prohibitive, and prevent these patients from being able to commence therapy on JUXTAPID or MYALEPT, respectively. We have a direct co-pay assistance program that provides support to eligible commercial patients for certain drug co-pays and co-insurance obligations for JUXTAPID. We also provide support to eligible commercial patients for certain drug co-pays and co-insurance obligations for MYALEPT treatment. We currently do not plan to provide financial support to patient assistance programs operated by independent charitable 501(c)(3) organizations in the U.S. that are permitted, subject to compliance with strict legal and regulatory requirements, to assist eligible HoFH and GL patients, as determined solely by the organization, with certain co-payments or co-insurance requirements for their drug therapies, which may include lomitapide or metreleptin. If we do elect to provide such financial support, we would not have control or input into the decisions of these organizations. We believe that investigations and enforcement actions by certain government agencies have caused a reduction in contributions to these third-party patient organizations, which may prevent these organizations from providing adequate financial assistance, including assistance with co-payment obligations, to individuals who would otherwise be unable to afford our products. As a result, Medicare Part D patients may not be able to afford their out-of-pocket co-payments for our products. In 2017, for example, we believe that a considerable number of JUXTAPID patients who were covered by Medicare Part D ceased treatment with JUXTAPID, due to reductions in contributions to patient assistance programs operated by independent charitable 501(c)(3) organizations, which resulted in prior sources of financial support for these patients being less available.
In the second quarter of 2017, to improve distribution efficiency, we signed a letter of intent for the distribution of JUXTAPID with the same specialty pharmacy that distributes MYALEPT in the U.S. The agreement was finalized in October 2017, and the transition of this distribution model was completed in November 2017. Our specialty pharmacy provides a comprehensive patient support program for each of JUXTAPID and MYALEPT in the U.S. Each program includes educational resources about the relevant product and disease; insurance verification and reimbursement support; monitoring and support of adherence; providing patients with information about potential sources of financial assistance; for JUXTAPID, nutritional counseling, and for MYALEPT, injection training; and a free drug program for certain eligible uninsured and underinsured patients. We also maintain a small internal patient support team to manage our specialty pharmacy and to supplement the patient support efforts of our specialty pharmacy.
Medical Affairs
We have a medical affairs function in the U.S., the EU, Latin America, and Japan. The medical affairs function is responsible for conducting medical research, including maintaining product registries, performing retrospective reviews of clinical data, and conducting post-marketing clinical trials as needed, to support the value proposition of our products. The medical affairs function also supports independent medical education programs and investigator-initiated studies by providing financial grants in a number of medical and disease-related areas. The responsibilities of medical affairs personnel also include providing training and education to physicians through the dissemination of medical information and publications; providing support in connection with our post-approval clinical commitments, and organizing scientific and medical advisory boards to obtain input from experts and practitioners on a variety of medical topics relevant to our products and the diseases our products treat.
Manufacturing, Supply and Distribution
We and our contract manufacturers are subject to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") regulations and other rules and regulations prescribed by regulatory authorities outside the U.S.
Lomitapide is a small molecule drug that is synthesized with readily available raw materials using conventional chemical processes. Hard gelatin capsules are prepared in 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg strengths. Metreleptin is a recombinant protein biologic that is produced using conventional fermentation, isolation, and purification processing techniques. The drug product is provided in nominal 10 mg vials that are reconstituted prior to injection. We are in the process of developing new presentations in nominal 2.5 mg and 5 mg vials. In order to provide metreleptin in these new presentations in the EU, assuming 
18

we obtain approval of our MAA, we must, after approval, file variations with the EMA establishing that these new presentations are comparable to the current 10 mg vial presentation.
We currently have no manufacturing facilities, and limited personnel with manufacturing experience. We rely on contract manufacturers to produce drug substance for lomitapide and metreleptin and to produce drug product for commercial supplies and for our clinical trials. Aegerion has long-term supply agreements with lomitapide drug substance and drug product manufacturers. Aegerion also has long-term supply agreements with metreleptin drug substance and drug product manufacturers, which were assigned to Aegerion in connection with the acquisition of metreleptin in 2015. In December 2017, the contract manufacturer for metreleptin drug product informed Aegerion that it will terminate its supply contract in December 2019. Aegerion has a supply of safety stock and has a mitigation plan with another contract manufacturer for metreleptin drug product. Validation at the back-up manufacturer is ongoing. In February 2017, our current contract manufacturer for metreleptin drug product received a Warning Letter from the FDA citing significant violations of cGMP regulations at the manufacturing facility where metreleptin drug product is manufactured. In response, the manufacturer may make modifications to the line on which metreleptin drug product is filled. We have sufficient inventory of lomitapide and metreleptin drug substance to maintain a supply for more than one year. 
In addition, our metreleptin drug product manufacturer also supplies bacteriostatic water for injection (“BWFI”), one of the approved diluents for reconstitution of metreleptin, which allows for use of a reconstituted vial of metreleptin for up to three days when stored appropriately. BWFI is only available for sale and approved for use in the U.S., and we or our contract manufacturers purchase it for supply with ex-US named patient sales and other expanded access distribution to reduce the number of metreleptin vials provided. Although BWFI is currently in shortage and on back order from our contract manufacturer, we have secured sufficient inventory to maintain a supply through late 2018 based on current demand. If in the future we exhaust our inventory of BWFI, ex-U.S. patients who obtain metreleptin via named patient sales or an expanded access program will need to use water for injection, a diluent which requires immediate use of product after reconstitution, and the discarding of any product remaining in the vial, which will likely result in more metreleptin vials being shipped and could decrease our revenues from named patient sales, increase our expenses, and impact our inventory of metreleptin and our agreements with our distributors. We do not have any other agreements in place for redundant supply or a second source for drug substance or drug product for either product.
In the U.S., lomitapide and metreleptin are distributed through a single specialty pharmacy that distributes the products directly to patients and, under limited circumstances, to other purchasers. Our specialty pharmacy takes title upon delivery of our products to such pharmacy. As noted above, in the second quarter of 2017, to improve distribution efficiency, we signed a letter of intent for the distribution of JUXTAPID with the same specialty pharmacy that distributes MYALEPT in the U.S. The agreement was finalized in October 2017 and the transition of this distribution model was completed in November 2017. Prior to the transition, the specialty pharmacy that distributed JUXTAPID did not take title to JUXTAPID; title transferred upon delivery of JUXTAPID to the purchaser. Our specialty pharmacy provides certain patient program support services, as set forth in the “Commercialization and Patient Support” section of this Annual Report. For named patient sales and other expanded access distribution, we use third-party providers to distribute our products either directly to the purchaser in the applicable country or to our local third-party distributor or service provider for such country.
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
We currently operate in one business segment, pharmaceuticals, and are focused on the development and commercialization of two commercial products. Financial information about this segment required herein is contained in the “Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” section of this Annual Report, and the geographic information required herein is contained in Note 17 - Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference.
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our competitors and potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. All of these competitors currently engage in, have engaged in or may engage in the future in the development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of pharmaceuticals that compete with or may in the future compete with lomitapide, metreleptin, or other products or product candidates we may develop or acquire. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations also are conducting research activities, seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or through joint ventures. The existence of these products, or other products or treatments of which we are not aware, or products or treatments that may be developed in the future, may adversely affect the marketability of products developed by us. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of lomitapide, metreleptin, and any other products or product candidates that we develop 
19

or acquire include efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, physician acceptance, level of generic competition, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
The market for cholesterol-lowering therapeutics is large and competitive with many drug classes. Lomitapide is approved in the U.S., Japan, the EU and in certain other countries as an adjunct to a low-fat diet and other lipid-lowering treatments to reduce LDL-C in adult HoFH patients. As a treatment for HoFH, JUXTAPID competes in the U.S. and certain other countries with Kynamro. Developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and now marketed by Kastle Therapeutics, Kynamro is an antisense apolipoprotein B-100 inhibitor which is taken as a weekly subcutaneous injection. JUXTAPID also faces significant competition in the treatment of adult HoFH patients with a class of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors. In July 2015, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Regeneron") and Sanofi announced that the FDA had approved the biologics licensing application ("BLA") for their PCSK9 inhibitor candidate, alirocumab, for use in addition to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy in adult HeFH patients and in patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who require additional lowering of LDL-C. In September 2015, following the positive opinion of the CHMP of the EMA, the EC approved alirocumab for the treatment of adult patients with HeFH or mixed dyslipidemia as an adjunct to diet, either in combination with a statin, or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to reach their LDL-cholesterol goals with the maximally-tolerated statin, or alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies for patients who are statin intolerant, or for whom a statin is contraindicated. The FDA approved Amgen Inc.’s ("Amgen") BLA for its anti-PCSK9 antibody, evolocumab, in August 2015, as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with HeFH or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, who require additional lowering of LDL-C; and as an adjunct to diet and other LDL-lowering therapies for the treatment of patients with HoFH, who require additional lowering of LDL-C. In July 2015, the EC approved the marketing authorization of evolocumab for the same indication as alirocumab, and for the treatment for certain patients with high cholesterol, including patients aged 12 years and over with HoFH in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies. In January 2016, the MHLW in Japan approved evolocumab for the treatment of patients with FH or hypercholesterolemia who have high risk of cardiovascular events and do not adequately respond to statins, and in July 2016 the MHLW approved alirocumab for the same indication. The regulatory agencies responsible for reviewing marketing authorization applications in Brazil, Canada, Colombia, and Argentina have also approved evolocumab for the treatment of patients with HoFH. Other companies, including Eli Lilly & Co. and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in collaboration with The Medicines Company, are also developing PCSK9 inhibitor products.
The introduction of PCSK9 inhibitors in the U.S. and in other key markets has significantly negatively impacted sales of JUXTAPID and we expect continued pressure on sales of JUXTAPID. This impact on JUXTAPID sales results from several factors, including: healthcare professionals switching some existing JUXTAPID patients to a PCSK9 inhibitor product; healthcare professionals trying most new adult HoFH patients on a PCSK9 inhibitor product before trying JUXTAPID because such products, in comparison to JUXTAPID, have fewer side effects, are significantly less expensive, and do not require that patients follow a special low-fat diet; requirements imposed by insurance companies, managed care organizations and other private payers in the U.S. that HoFH patients demonstrate an inability to achieve an adequate LDL-C response on PCSK9 inhibitor products before access to JUXTAPID is approved; and the likelihood that prior authorization (which we believe is required by all U.S. payers) will encourage a switch of current JUXTAPID patients to the less expensive PCSK9 inhibitor product. Competitors for JUXTAPID may enjoy other competitive advantages if insurance companies, managed care organizations or other private payers in the U.S. impose other hurdles to access or other significant restrictions or limitations on reimbursement, or require switching of JUXTAPID patients to PCSK9 inhibitor products. We believe that many of the PCSK9 inhibitor switches from current JUXTAPID patients have been at the direction of the prescribing physician, and physicians may ultimately not decide to switch the adult HoFH patient back to JUXTAPID even if the patient does not reach a goal of LDL-C response while being treated with a PCSK9 inhibitor product, or otherwise prescribe JUXTAPID to patients. It is unknown how many adult HoFH patients, if any, may be switched back to JUXTAPID or the period of time in which this might take place. 
The availability of PCSK9 inhibitor products in commercial markets outside of the U.S. is having similarly negative effects on sales, including named patient sales, of lomitapide outside the U.S., particularly in Brazil, Japan, Canada and Colombia, where PCSK9 inhibitor products have been approved by the regulatory authorities and are available commercially. If the continued negative impact of PCSK9 inhibitors is greater than we expect, it may make it more difficult for us to generate revenues and achieve profitability. 
Potential future competition for JUXTAPID may include drugs and biologics currently in clinical development for the treatment of patients with HoFH. Development programs currently include other oral drug therapeutics, such as Gemphire Therapeutics’ gemcabene which targets apolipoprotein C-III and is currently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of FH. Other potential therapies include gene therapies, such as REGENXBIO’s LDL-receptor gene therapy which is currently in Phase 1/2 development for HoFH. Also, although there are no other MTP-I compounds currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in humans, there may be other MTP-I compounds in development. If approved, novel drug or biologic therapies for the treatment of HoFH or FH could negatively impact the sales of JUXTAPID in the future.
20

In addition, in the EU, patients with HoFH who are unable to reach their recommended target LDL-C levels on conventionally used drug therapies are commonly treated using LDL apheresis, in which cholesterol is removed from the body through mechanical filtration. Although levels of LDL-C are reduced using apheresis, there is a rapid rebound. Because apheresis provides only temporary reductions in LDL-C levels, it must be repeated frequently, typically one or two times per month. The widespread use and availability of apheresis as a treatment for HoFH in the EU, combined with the lower cost of apheresis compared to LOJUXTA, made it more difficult for us to maintain a profitable business for LOJUXTA in the key markets of the EU. For example, in part because Aegerion was unable to obtain commercially acceptable pricing and reimbursement approvals for LOJUXTA in several of the key markets of the EU, Aegerion elected to cease commercialization in the EU, and in December 2016, entered into a license agreement with Amryt under which Amryt was granted an exclusive right to develop and commercialize LOJUXTA in the EEA, Switzerland, Turkey, and certain Middle Eastern and North African countries, including Israel.
MYALEPT is the first and only product approved in the U.S. for the treatment of complications of leptin deficiency in patients with GL. There are, however, a number of therapies approved to treat these complications independently that are not specific to GL. Certain clinical complications of GL, including diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, may be treated with insulin and/or oral medications, such as metformin, insulin secretagogues, fibrates, or statins, but patients with GL often have an inadequate response to these therapies.
We are seeking regulatory approval of metreleptin as a treatment for GL and a PL subset in the EU and evaluating whether to seek regulatory approval of metreleptin for that PL subset in the U.S. and in other key countries where it makes business sense to do so. Akcea Therapeutics (“Akcea”) is developing volanesorsen, an antisense therapy targeting apolipoprotein C-III, which is currently in Phase 3 development for patients with familial PL with diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus or hypertriglyceridemia, which, if approved and depending on the labeled indication, could potentially compete with metreleptin, if metreleptin is approved for the treatment of a PL subset.
We may also face future competition from companies selling generic alternatives of our products in countries where we do not have patent coverage, orphan drug status or another form of data or marketing exclusivity or where patent coverage or data or marketing exclusivity has expired or may, in the future, be challenged.
Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Rights
Our business relies on patents covering inventions licensed from third parties, and on other means to protect our technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business. Our policy is to file patent applications on a worldwide basis in those jurisdictions where we consider it beneficial, depending on the subject matter and our commercialization strategy.
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to:

• | obtain and maintain patent, regulatory exclusivity and other proprietary protection for the products, technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;


• | defend our patents;


• | preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and


• | operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.

Patent Rights and Regulatory Exclusivity
Lomitapide. Our lomitapide patent portfolio consists of eight issued U.S. patents and issued patents in Europe, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand and Japan and pending applications in the U.S., Japan, Canada, and India, all of which have been licensed to us in a specific field. A five-year patent term extension has been granted for our U.S. patent covering the composition of matter of lomitapide, originally scheduled to expire in early 2015, and will now expire in 2020. The non-U.S. patents directed to the composition of matter of lomitapide have expired. Our six method of use patents in the U.S. cover certain dosing regimens for lomitapide, with one such patent expiring in 2027 and the other five patents expiring in 2025. Two separate inter partes review ("IPR") petitions were filed with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board ("PTAB") of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in August 2015 by the Coalition for Affordable Drugs VIII L.L.C. ("CFAD") challenging the validity of two of these method of use patents. On March 6, 2017, the PTAB determined that the CFAD failed to show that the claims of these patents were invalid. Our non-U.S. patents, including the European Patent Office ("EPO") methods of use patent, expire in 2025. The EPO method of use patents may be eligible for up to about three years of supplemental protection in certain EPO countries, and we have applied for such 
21

protection in the countries in which LOJUXTA is approved, on a country-by-country basis; in some countries supplemental protection has been granted to extend patent protection to July or August of 2028, while in other countries the application is still pending. An opposition was filed with respect to the EPO method of use patent, but has since been revoked.
We have obtained orphan drug exclusivity for JUXTAPID in the U.S. for the treatment of HoFH (which expires in December 2019). JUXTAPID’s new chemical entity exclusivity expired on December 21, 2017, and, as such, since December 21, 2016, an Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA") or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted for JUXTAPID if it contains a Paragraph IV certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. If we instigate a suit against an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receiving a Paragraph IV notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a period of 30 months. The FDA may approve the proposed competitor product before the expiration of the 30-month stay if a court finds our patents invalid or not infringed or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation.
Moreover, if one or more ANDA filers were to receive approval to sell a generic or follow-on version of JUXTAPID, those competitor products could potentially be marketed as early as December 21, 2019 (the date on which JUXTAPID’s orphan drug exclusivity ends) and JUXTAPID would become subject to increased competition at that time. The FDA’s approval letter for the modified JUXTAPID REMS program, received on January 3, 2017, specified that an authorized generic drug under the JUXTAPID NDA must have an FDA-approved REMS program prior to marketing.
Metreleptin. Our metreleptin patent portfolio consists of two issued U.S. patents and issued patents in Europe, Canada, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, China, South Korea and Japan, all of which have been licensed to us. The U.S. and non-U.S. patents directed to the composition of matter of metreleptin have expired. The patent family covering metreleptin methods of use is co-owned by Amgen, University of Texas and the NIH, and is licensed to us from Amgen. We have consent from each additional co-owner to the sublicense granted by Amgen and have also obtained a direct in-license from one of the other co-owners of this patent to its rights under the patent family. The U.S. method of use patent directed to treating lipoatrophy has been elected for a 1,445-day patent term extension that will extend the expiration date to 2027. The U.S. method of use patent directed to treating diabetes associated with lipoatrophy and the non-U.S. method of use patents issued in certain European countries, Canada, and Australia, and pending in Japan, expire in 2022. In the U.S., metreleptin qualifies for 12-year biologic exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the "BPCI Act"), which will expire in 2026. If approved by the EMA, metreleptin would be entitled to 10 years of market and orphan drug exclusivity in the EU.

Licensing
Lomitapide
University of Pennsylvania
In May 2006, Aegerion entered into a license agreement with The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, ("UPenn") pursuant to which Aegerion obtained an exclusive, worldwide license from UPenn to certain know-how and a range of patent rights applicable to lomitapide. In particular, Aegerion obtained a license to certain patents and patent applications owned by UPenn relating to the dosing of MTP-I compounds, including lomitapide, and certain patents and patent applications and know-how covering the composition of matter of lomitapide that were assigned to UPenn by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ("BMS") for use either as a monotherapy or with other dyslipidemic therapies to treat patients with HoFH. Aegerion also has the right to use lomitapide in the field of monotherapy or in combination with other dyslipidemic therapies for treatment of patients with other severe forms of hypercholesterolemia unable to come within 15% of NCEP’s LDL-C goal on maximal tolerated oral therapy, as determined by the patient’s prescribing physician, or with severe combined hyperlipidemia unable to come within 15% of NCEP’s non-HDL-C goal on maximal tolerated oral therapy, as determined by the patient’s prescribing physician, or with severe 
22

hypertriglyceridemia unable to reduce triglycerides ("TG") <1,000 on maximal tolerated therapy. We refer to the patents and patent applications assigned by BMS to UPenn and licensed to Aegerion by UPenn as the BMS-UPenn assigned patents.
To the extent that rights under the BMS-UPenn assigned patents were not licensed to Aegerion under Aegerion's license agreement with UPenn or were retained by UPenn for non-commercial education and research purposes, those rights, other than with respect to lomitapide, were licensed by UPenn back to BMS on an exclusive basis pursuant to a technology donation agreement between UPenn and BMS. In the technology donation agreement, BMS agreed not to develop or commercialize any compound, including lomitapide, covered by the composition of matter patents included in the BMS-UPenn assigned patents in the field licensed to Aegerion exclusively by UPenn. Through Aegerion's license with UPenn, as provided in the technology donation agreement, Aegerion has the exclusive right with respect to the BMS-UPenn assigned patents regarding their enforcement and prosecution in the field licensed exclusively to Aegerion by UPenn.
The license from UPenn covers, among other things, the development and commercialization of lomitapide alone or in combination with other active ingredients in the licensed field. The license is subject to customary non-commercial rights retained by UPenn for non-commercial educational and research purposes. Aegerion may grant sublicenses under the license, subject to certain limitations. Aegerion is required to make royalty payments to UPenn at a range of royalty rates in the high single digits on net sales of lomitapide in countries where lomitapide has patent protection, and of any other products covered by the license (subject to a variety of customary reductions), and share with UPenn specified percentages of sublicensing royalties and certain other consideration that Aegerion receives under any sublicenses that Aegerion may grant. Aegerion made royalty payments to UPenn through November 29, 2016. There were no royalty payments made to UPenn during the period from November 30, 2016 to December 31, 2016. In 2017, Aegerion made $3.1 million of royalty payments to UPenn and had $0.7 million in royalties payable to UPenn as of December 31, 2017. Aegerion will be required to make development milestone payments to UPenn of up to an aggregate of approximately $2.6 million if we decide to develop lomitapide for indications within the licensed field other than HoFH, and we achieve certain milestones in such development efforts. All such development milestone payments for these other indications are payable only once, no matter how many licensed products for these other indications are developed.
The license agreement with UPenn will remain in effect on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent right covering the product in the applicable country. Aegerion has the right to terminate this license agreement for convenience upon 60 days prior written notice to UPenn or for UPenn’s uncured material breach of the license agreement. UPenn may terminate this license agreement for Aegerion’s uncured material breach of the license agreement, uncured failure to make payments to UPenn or if Aegerion is the subject of specified bankruptcy or liquidation events.
Metreleptin
Amgen Inc.
In connection with Aegerion’s acquisition of MYALEPT in January 2015, Aegerion acquired a license agreement between Amgen and Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., dated February 7, 2006 (the "Amgen License") pursuant to which Aegerion obtained an exclusive worldwide license from Amgen to certain know-how and patents and patent applications covering the composition of matter and methods of use of metreleptin to develop, manufacture and commercialize a preparation containing metreleptin (the "Amgen Licensed Products").
As part of the Amgen License, Aegerion also obtained an exclusive sublicense of Amgen’s exclusive rights to certain metreleptin-related patents and patent applications owned by the Rockefeller University and exclusively licensed to Amgen under a license agreement dated April 14, 1995, as amended (the "Rockefeller License") and an exclusive sublicense of Amgen’s non-exclusive rights to certain metreleptin-related patents and patent applications owned by The Regents of the University of California and non-exclusively licensed to Amgen under a license agreement dated July 13, 2005 (the "UCSF License"). Amgen retains rights to conduct research, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities with respect to products other than the Amgen Licensed Products.
Aegerion may grant sublicenses under the licenses and sublicenses granted by Amgen, subject to certain limitations, including Amgen’s right of first offer for any out-license, partnership, co-development, commercialization, co-promotion or similar agreement related to metreleptin or the Amgen Licensed Products, which expires in February 2021. Under this license agreement, Amgen must notify Aegerion of any potential third-party partnership regarding any intellectual property rights controlled by Amgen in the neurology field and Aegerion will have a right of first negotiation for any license, partnership, co-development, commercialization, co-promotion or similar agreement, which expires in February 2021.
Aegerion is required to make royalty payments to Amgen on net sales of each Amgen Licensed Product on a country-by-country basis (i) at a royalty rate in the low double digits where the Amgen Licensed Product has patent protection or market 
23

exclusivity granted by a regulatory authority at the time of regulatory approval in the applicable country during the applicable royalty term, which runs on a country-by-country basis until the later of (a) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim covering an Amgen Licensed Product in the applicable country, (b) expiration of any market exclusivity granted by a regulatory authority, and (c) ten years from the date on which an Amgen Licensed Product is first sold to a third party in a country after regulatory approval for the Amgen Licensed Product has been granted in such country ("Amgen Royalty Term") or (ii) at a royalty rate in the mid-single digits to low double digits where the Amgen Licensed Product receives patent protection or market exclusivity following the time of regulatory approval in the applicable country, in either case subject to a variety of customary reductions.
Under the Amgen License, Aegerion is also required to directly meet certain payment obligations under the Rockefeller License and UCSF License. Aegerion is required to make royalty payments to Rockefeller University on net sales of each product with patent rights or know-how in the field of obesity genes, obesity gene products, and molecules that modulate or mediate their action and/or regulation on a country-by-country basis at a range of royalty rates in the low single digits depending on whether the product has an orphan product designation or not until the later to occur of expiration of (i) patent protection, (ii) any market exclusivity period granted in the applicable country, or (iii) any data exclusivity period in the applicable country (with certain limitations related to the number of units sold). In February 2015, Aegerion paid a one-time $5.0 million milestone payment to Rockefeller University, which was due twelve months following the receipt of marketing approval for MYALEPT in the U.S. Aegerion is also required to pay to Rockefeller University a percentage in the low double digits of any upfront license fees or one-time fees Aegerion receives in consideration for any sublicense of the licensed rights. There are no material payment obligations outstanding under the UCSF License. Also, in connection with the acquisition of metreleptin, Aegerion entered into a letter agreement with AstraZeneca pursuant to which Aegerion agreed to make royalty payments payable by AstraZeneca and its affiliates to BMS with respect to net sales of metreleptin in the U.S. The time-based royalty rate ranges from mid-single digits to low double digits, increasing annually in years 2016 to 2019 from rates in the low single digits to low double digits, peaking in years 2019 to 2020 at a rate in the low double digits before decreasing in years 2022 through 2025 to rates in the high single digits to mid-single digits. The royalty obligation to BMS terminates in 2026.
The Amgen License will terminate upon the expiration of the last Amgen Royalty Term for any Amgen Licensed Product. Aegerion has the right to terminate the Amgen License for convenience upon 90 days prior written notice to Amgen or for Amgen’s uncured material breach of the Amgen License, or becoming subject to specified bankruptcy or liquidation events. Amgen may terminate the Amgen License for Aegerion’s uncured failure to make payments to Amgen or if Aegerion is the subject of specified bankruptcy or liquidation events.
Aegerion made royalty payments to Amgen, Rockefeller University and BMS related to the sales of MYALEPT through November 29, 2016. There were no royalty payments made to these parties from November 30, 2016 to December 31, 2016. In 2017, Aegerion made aggregate royalty payments of $9.7 million to Amgen, Rockefeller University and BMS, and had $2.9 million in aggregate royalties payable to these parties as of December 31, 2017.

Shionogi & Co., Ltd.
In connection with Aegerion’s acquisition of MYALEPT in January 2015, Aegerion acquired a license agreement between Shionogi and Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., dated July 8, 2009 pursuant to which Shionogi was granted an exclusive sublicense to the patent rights licensed under the Amgen License and the Rockefeller License to develop and commercialize the Amgen Licensed Products and know-how for use in the treatment of lipodystrophy in humans in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan (the "Shionogi Territory"). This license agreement does not provide Shionogi with manufacturing rights. Shionogi may grant further sublicenses under the license, subject to certain limitations.
The license agreement requires that Shionogi use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approvals for, and commercialize the Amgen Licensed Products in the Shionogi Territory. Shionogi is required to make royalty payments to Aegerion on net sales of each Amgen Licensed Product at a range of royalty rates in the mid-to high-single digits dependent on the amount of net sales. Shionogi made royalty payments to Aegerion related to sales of MYALEPT in Japan through November 29, 2016. During the period from November 30, 2016 to December 31, 2016, Aegerion did not receive any royalty payments from Shionogi. In 2017, the total amount of royalty payments received from Shionogi was $0.1 million. Shionogi will be required to make milestone payments to Aegerion of up to an aggregate of approximately $25.0 million if and when Shionogi achieves certain commercialization milestones. Such milestone payments are payable only once. Under the license agreement, Shionogi has also agreed to directly comply with the payment obligations under the Rockefeller License and Amgen License, as set forth under those agreements, relating to its activities under this license agreement.
The license agreement with Shionogi will terminate upon the expiration of the last Amgen Royalty Term for any Amgen Licensed Product with respect to which Shionogi has a license under this license agreement. Aegerion has the right to terminate this license agreement for Shionogi’s uncured material breach of the license agreement, failure to make any payment due to 
24

Aegerion, a procedural default, or becoming subject to specified bankruptcy or liquidation events. Shionogi may terminate this license agreement for Aegerion’s uncured material breach of this license agreement, failure to make payments due to Shionogi, or if Aegerion is the subject of specified bankruptcy or liquidation events, or if Shionogi determines it is not feasible to develop, launch or sell the Amgen Licensed Products due to scientific, technical, regulatory or commercial reasons. Aegerion may also terminate this license agreement at any time without cause by exercising our buy-back option for a one-time fee to Shionogi equal to (i) a number in the low single digits times the amount of expenses and fees incurred by Shionogi in developing the Amgen Licensed Products plus (ii) an amount no more than a number in the mid-double digits times monthly net sales of the Amgen Licensed Products by Shionogi in the month the option is exercised.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, the EU, EU Member States, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of lomitapide and metreleptin. In the future, if we were to develop or acquire any other products, or any product candidates, they would also be subject to such regulations and oversight. Our products must be approved by the FDA through the NDA or the BLA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S., and must be approved by foreign regulatory authorities via various procedures before they can be marketed in the applicable country, including the EMA or the regulatory authorities of the EU Member States before they can be placed on the market in the EU.
U.S. Drug and Biologic Development Process
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and implementing regulations, and regulates biologics under both the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act ("PHSA"). The process of obtaining marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject a company to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement-related letters, product recalls, product seizures, changes to the conditions surrounding marketing approval such as labeling changes or changes to a REMS program, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, civil money penalties, fines, refusals of government contracts, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the U.S. is extensive and generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices ("GLP") and other applicable regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application ("IND"), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of human clinical trials, including adequate and well-controlled trials, according to Good Clinical Practices ("GCP") to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use, or the safety, purity, and potency of a biological product;


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board ("IRB"), representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;


• | completion of registration batches and validation of the manufacturing process to show that we are capable of consistently producing quality batches of product;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and

25


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.

Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies, to assess the safety and quality of the product. Animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDA’s GLP regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act. Human clinical trials cannot commence until an IND application is submitted and becomes effective. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor also will include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance, or other reasons.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and GCP requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of, clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, an IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, and continues to provide oversight of the study until it is completed. Additionally, companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with regulations and guidelines for complying with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting of adverse events. Foreign studies conducted under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the U.S. Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND may be submitted in support of an NDA or BLA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data.
Each new clinical protocol must be submitted for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the study, the primary and secondary endpoints of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1. The investigational drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects, and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients with the target diseases.


• | Phase 2. This phase involves trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.


• | Phase 3. This phase involves trials undertaken after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained and is intended to further evaluate dosage and clinical efficacy and safety of the drug, or the safety, purity, and potency of a biological product, in an expanded patient population, often at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and product labeling.

Progress reports detailing developments associated with the clinical testing program must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or animal test results that suggest a significant risk to human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Further, success in either preclinical studies or early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Sponsors of certain interventional 
26

clinical trials, except for Phase 1 trials, are required to submit certain clinical trial information for inclusion in the public clinical trial registry and results data bank maintained by the NIH, which are publicly available at http://clinicaltrials.gov.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies in non-human models, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product, and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the product, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA generally is subject to the payment of a user fee, although NDAs or BLAs for designated orphan drugs are exempt from this fee.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2007, as amended ("PREA"), an application or supplement to an application for a drug with certain novel features (e.g., new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form) must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals or full or partial waivers for submission of this data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biologic for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA is required to refer an NDA for a new chemical entity ("NCE") to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, or explain why such review is not necessary. Other NDAs or BLAs may also be referred to an advisory committee for evaluation and recommendation. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it frequently follows such recommendations. The approval or licensure process is lengthy and difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval or licensure. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive; and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application. The FDA reviews an application to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use, or whether a biologic is safe, pure, and potent, and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. In addition, the FDA often will conduct a bioresearch monitoring inspection of the clinical trial sites involved in conducting pivotal studies to ensure data integrity and compliance with applicable GCP requirements.
Applications receive either standard or priority review. A product representing a major advance in treatment or treatment where no adequate therapy exists may receive priority review. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA"), FDA has ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard new molecular entity ("NME") NDA or original BLA and six months for a priority review NME NDA, BLA, or efficacy supplement. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates and in certain circumstances the PDUFA goal date may be extended. In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and which provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments, may receive accelerated approval. In that situation, the product may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval must perform post-marketing studies to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise confirm the effect of the product on a clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process for certain products.
27

If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases, dosages or patient populations, or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may impose distribution and use restrictions and other limitations on labeling and communication activities with respect to an approved product via a REMS program, to mitigate serious risks, which could include Medication Guides, patient package inserts, physician communication plans, and/or ETASU. ETASU may include restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Because of the risk of liver toxicity, JUXTAPID is available in the U.S. only through a REMS program, which program was modified and approved by the FDA on January 3, 2017. The goal of the modified JUXTAPID REMS program, as discussed earlier in this “Business” section of this Annual Report, is to mitigate the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with the use of JUXTAPID by ensuring that: (a) prescribers are educated about the approved indication for JUXTAPID, the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with the use of JUXTAPID, and the need to monitor patients during treatment with JUXTAPID as per product labeling; (b) JUXTAPID is dispensed only to patients with a clinical or laboratory diagnosis consistent with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia; and (c) patients are informed about the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with the use of JUXTAPID and the need for baseline and periodic monitoring. The ETASU in the modified JUXTAPID REMS program approved by the FDA on January 3, 2017 has been significantly enhanced and imposes significant requirements on healthcare professionals, pharmacies, and patients. See the “Business-Lomitapide” section of this Annual Report for further information regarding the modified JUXTAPID REMS program. MYALEPT is also subject to a REMS program, due to the risks of serious adverse sequelae, as a result of the development of anti-metreleptin antibodies that neutralize endogenous leptin and/or MYALEPT, and the risk of lymphoma. The MYALEPT REMS program aims to educate prescribers about these risks and to restrict access to MYALEPT by requiring prescriber certification, pharmacy certification, and prescriber attestation that each patient has a diagnosis consistent with GL. The REMS programs for each product restrict distribution and sales of our products and impose ongoing implementation requirements that could be burdensome or costly.
The Hatch-Waxman Act, Marketing Exclusivity in the U.S. and Patent Term Restoration
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, established two abbreviated approval pathways for drug products that are in some way follow-on versions of already approved NDA products.
Generic Drugs. A generic version of an approved drug is approved by means of an ANDA through which the sponsor demonstrates that the proposed product is identical or bioequivalent to the approved, brand-name drug, referred to as the Reference Listed Drug ("RLD"). Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and RLD have the same active ingredient(s), in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration; are intended for the same uses; have the same labeling; and are bioequivalent. An ANDA need not independently demonstrate the proposed product’s safety and effectiveness; rather the proposed product’s safety and effectiveness are inferred from the fact that the product is demonstrated to be the same as, and bioequivalent to, the RLD, which the FDA previously found to be safe and effective. These drugs are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the RLD, and under state law they typically can be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the RLD.
505(b)(2) NDAs. If a product is similar to, but not the same as, an already approved product (and thus is not eligible for submission of an ANDA), it may be submitted for approval via an NDA under FDCA section 505(b)(2). Like an ANDA, a 505(b)(2) application is permitted to rely on the FDA’s finding that the RLD is safe and effective to the extent the products share similar features, but the sponsor must submit its own product-specific safety and effectiveness data to support any differences between the proposed and reference products.
RLD Patents. An NDA sponsor must identify to the FDA any patents that claim the drug substance, drug product or method of using the drug. These patents are among the information about the product that is listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the "Orange Book"). The sponsor of an ANDA or 505(b) (2) application seeking to rely on an approved product as the RLD must make one of several certifications regarding each listed patent, and these certifications can affect the timing of approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. For example, a “Paragraph III” certification is the sponsor’s statement that it will wait for the patent to expire before obtaining approval for its product. A “Paragraph IV” certification is submitted to obtain approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application before expiration of a listed patent and is an assertion that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by the new product.
Marketing Exclusivities in the U.S.
The Hatch-Waxman Act provides periods of regulatory exclusivity for products that would serve as RLDs for an ANDA, or 505(b)(2) application. If a drug is an NCE, generally meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance, there is a period of five years from the product’s approval during which the FDA may not accept for filing any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for 
28

a drug with the same active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. According to the Orange Book, JUXTAPID’s NCE exclusivity expired on December 21, 2017, which means that an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted for JUXTAPID. 
A product that is not an NCE may qualify for three years of marketing exclusivity following approval, when the application contains new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, conducted or sponsored by the applicant and deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. Three-year exclusivity is often available for changes to a previously-approved drug product, such as new indications, strengths or dosage forms. This exclusivity period does not preclude filing or review of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application; rather, the FDA is precluded from granting final approval to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until three years after approval of the RLD. In addition, this three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product.
Once the FDA accepts for filing an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification, the applicant must within 20 days provide notice to the RLD NDA holder and patent owner that the application with patent challenge has been submitted, and provide the factual and legal basis for the applicant’s assertion that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. If the NDA holder or patent owner files suit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receiving the Paragraph IV notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a period of 30 months from the date of receipt of the notice. If the RLD has NCE exclusivity and the notice is given and suit filed during the fifth year of exclusivity, the 30-month stay is extended so that it does not expire until 7 ½ years after approval of the RLD. The FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the 30-month stay if, within that time period, the patent involved expires, the parties settle the lawsuit or a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity available in the U.S. under Section 505A of the FDCA. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to an existing exclusivity period, including orphan drug exclusivity, or delay in approval resulting from certain patent certifications. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial or trials and submission of pediatric data that fairly responds to an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial or trials. The data need not show the product to be safe or effective in the pediatric population studied; rather if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within statutory time limits, any periods of regulatory exclusivity or Orange Book-listed patent protections that cover the drug (other than a 30-month stay) are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. Pediatric exclusivity, however, cannot extend any regulatory exclusivity or patent protection if the FDA makes its determination that the pediatric studies fairly respond to the Written Request later than nine months prior to the expiration of the exclusivity or patent protection period. In the first quarter of 2015, the FDA issued a Written Request for a study to evaluate lomitapide in pediatric HoFH patients, which, if completed as described, would provide for six months of pediatric exclusivity under the FDCA. In the second quarter of 2015, we decided to decline the FDA’s Written Request regarding the study in pediatric HoFH patients, because we believe that the size and complexity of the requested trial created a considerable barrier to the feasibility of the study. Given that we have declined to conduct the study requested by the FDA, we will not be entitled to the six months of additional exclusivity available for conducting a study that is the subject of a Written Request issued by the FDA.
Patent Term Restoration
The Hatch-Waxman Act established a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. The maximum period of restoration is five years and cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent and within 60 days of the NDA approval. The United States Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO"), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. A five-year patent term extension has been granted for our U.S. patent covering the composition of matter of lomitapide, extending the patent term to 2020 from the originally scheduled expiration of early 2015. With respect to metreleptin, the U.S. method-of-use patent directed to treating lipoatrophy has been elected for a 1,445-day patent term extension that will extend its expiration date to 2027.

The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act 
The BPCI Act, enacted in 2010 as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (as amended, the "Healthcare Reform Act"), authorizes the FDA to license a biological product that is biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, a PHSA-licensed reference biological product through an abbreviated pathway. The BPCI Act establishes criteria for determining that a product is biosimilar to an already-licensed biologic (a reference product), and establishes a process by which an abbreviated BLA for a biosimilar product is submitted, reviewed and approved. The BPCI Act provides periods of exclusivity that protect a reference product from biosimilar competition. Under the BPCI Act, innovator manufacturers of original reference products are granted twelve years of exclusive use before biosimilar versions of such products can be licensed for marketing in the U.S. This means that the FDA may not approve an application for a biosimilar version of a reference product until twelve years after the date of approval of the reference product (with a potential six-month extension of exclusivity if certain pediatric studies are conducted and the results reported to FDA), although a biosimilar application may be submitted four years after the date of licensure of the reference product. Additionally, the BPCI Act establishes procedures by which the biosimilar applicant must provide information about its application and product to the reference product sponsor, and by which information about potentially relevant patents is shared and litigation over patents may proceed in advance of approval. The BPCI Act also provides a period of exclusivity for the first biosimilar to be determined by the FDA to be interchangeable with the reference product. We believe that under the BPCI Act, metreleptin has 12 years of exclusivity in the U.S. from February 24, 2014, the date of the product’s approval by the FDA.
The objectives of the BPCI Act are conceptually similar to those of the Hatch-Waxman Act, which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of small molecule drug products. The FDA has not yet issued proposed regulations setting forth its interpretation of the BPCI Act’s provisions but has issued guidance documents related to BPCI Act implementation concerning biosimilarity and interchangeability, BLA submission requirements, and exclusivity. We anticipate that contours of the BPCI Act will be further defined through issuance of additional guidance documents by the FDA, proposed regulations, and decisions in the course of considering specific applications.
Like pediatric exclusivity applicable to drug products approved under the FDCA, pediatric exclusivity applicable to biological reference products is subject to an exception. Pediatric exclusivity will not apply to either the 12-year reference product or the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity periods if the FDA determines later than nine months prior to the expiration of such period that the study reports a BLA sponsor submitted in response to a written request for pediatric studies met the terms of that request.
The BPCI Act sets forth a complex mechanism for resolving patent disputes that involves a step-wise exchange of information prior to the initiation of a patent infringement lawsuit against a biosimilar or interchangeable product sponsor. Unlike the Hatch-Waxman Act, the BPCI Act provides no automatic stay on approval of a biosimilar or interchangeable product application based on patents.
U.S. Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or for which there is no reasonable expectation that development and production costs will be recovered from sales of the drug for such disease or condition in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval and is the first drug approved for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve for seven years any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in limited circumstances such as a demonstration that the subsequent drug is clinically superior or the inability of the existing manufacturer to supply the market. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for an orphan product that the FDA finds to be the “same drug” as our product candidate for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biologic designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the scope of its designation, it may be no longer entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. In addition to creating a 12-year period of reference product exclusivity, the BPCI Act clarifies the interaction of that exclusivity with orphan drug exclusivity, such that the licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable version of a reference biological product that was designated and approved as an orphan drug may only occur after the later of the expiration of any applicable seven-year orphan drug exclusivity or the 12-year reference product exclusivity (or seven and one-half years and 12.5 years with pediatric exclusivity). The FDA has granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity for JUXTAPID in the treatment of HoFH which is scheduled to expire on December 21, 2019, and seven years of orphan drug exclusivity for MYALEPT in the treatment of GL which is scheduled to expire on February 24, 2021.
30

Fast Track Designation
The FDA’s Fast Track program is intended to facilitate the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. Under the program, the sponsor of a new drug may request that the FDA designate the drug for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the product candidate. A drug that receives Fast Track designation may be eligible for more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the drug’s development; more frequent written correspondence from the FDA about the design of the proposed clinical trials; and rolling review, meaning the sponsor may submit its NDA in sections rather than wait until the entire NDA is complete. Drugs with Fast Track designation may be more likely to become eligible for a Priority Review, which provides for FDA review of an NDA for a NME within a six-month time frame from the time the complete NDA is accepted for filing (60 days after submission), as opposed to the ten-month time frame for a Standard Review. The FDA grants Priority Review for products that demonstrate the potential to be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a serious condition. 
Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher
Certain drugs may also be candidates for a rare pediatric disease designation by the FDA. In order to qualify for such designation, a sponsor must demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction that the proposed indication is for the treatment or prevention of a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that product, and is a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years. Under the FDCA, a sponsor who receives approval of an NDA for a product that is for the prevention or treatment of a rare pediatric disease and meets certain additional criteria, may qualify for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher ("PRV"). A PRV can be redeemed to receive priority review under an expedited timeframe for a subsequent marketing application for a different product. A PRV may also be sold or transferred from the initial sponsor to another sponsor. The voucher may be further transferred any number of times before it is used. Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA’s authority to award rare pediatric disease PRVs has been extended until 2020, and until 2022 for products that receive rare pediatric disease designation by 2020.
Post-Approval Requirements in the U.S.
Once an approval is granted, products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA may withdraw the approval, following notice and an opportunity for a hearing, if, among other things, compliance with certain regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or efficacy problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. If new safety issues are identified following approval, the FDA may require the NDA sponsor to take certain measures, such as revising the approved labeling to reflect the new safety information, conducting post-market studies or clinical trials to assess the new safety information, and/or implementing or changing a REMS program to mitigate newly-identified risks. These are often referred to as Phase 4 or post-marketing studies, and may involve additional clinical trials, nonclinical testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or licensed biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. In its approval of JUXTAPID, the FDA required three post-marketing requirements; the MYALEPT approval was associated with 15 post-marketing requirements and commitments. See Marketed Products - Lomitapide - Clinical Development and Post-Marketing Commitments and Marketed Products - Metreleptin - Clinical Development and Post-Marketing Commitments for details of our post-marketing commitments to applicable regulatory authorities.
Companies engaged in manufacturing drug products or their components must comply with applicable cGMP requirements and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Compliance with cGMP includes adhering to requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, and records and reports. The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, and processes used in manufacturing pharmaceutical products prior to approval. If, after receiving approval, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process (all of which are, to some degree, incorporated in the NDA or BLA), additional regulatory review and approval may be required. Sponsors of approved products also are subject to significant annual program user fees.
31

Packaging and Distribution in the U.S.
Our products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule ("FSS") of the General Services Administration; as a result, additional laws and requirements apply. For example, our products meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements in compliance with the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. Failure to comply with applicable cGMP requirements and conditions of product approval may lead the FDA to take enforcement actions, which may range from issuing a warning letter to seeking sanctions, including fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA approval, seizure or recall of products, and criminal prosecution. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to maintain cGMP compliance. We cannot be certain that our present or future third-party manufacturers will consistently comply with cGMP and other applicable FDA regulatory requirements.
In addition, companies manufacturing or distributing drug products pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to record-keeping requirements; requirements on reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, and providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy or safety, purity, and potency information for drugs and biologics, respectively; compliance within REMS program reporting obligations; drug and biologic sampling and distribution requirements; compliance with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and compliance with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. As discussed more fully below, the FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information regarding marketed products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for their approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. 
Other Regulatory and Liability Matters 
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the U.S. in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS"), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services ("DHHS"), the DOJ, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. 
We maintain workers' compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the U.S., our business is subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. We must obtain approval of a product by the regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. In addition, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. For example, in the EU, the conduct of clinical trials is currently governed by the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, which 
32

imposes obligations and procedures that are similar to those provided in applicable U.S. laws. The EU Good Clinical Practice and EU Good Laboratory Practice standards must also be respected during the conduct of the trials. Prior to commencement of a clinical trial in an EU Member State, an application for authorization of a clinical trial must be submitted to the regulatory authority and the relevant Ethics Committee of the relevant EU Member State in which the clinical trial will take place. The regulatory authorities of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial will be conducted must authorize the conduct of the trial, and the independent Ethics Committee must grant a positive opinion in relation to the conduct of the clinical trial in the relevant EU Member State before the commencement of the trial. Any substantial changes to trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be submitted to or approved by the relevant regulatory authorities and ethics committees. However, under the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation No. 536/2014, which is expected to take effect in late 2018, a more harmonized procedure will apply, with clinical trial authorization and other applications or notifications being submitted through a centralized EU clinical trials portal.
The approval process for clinical trials in other countries outside the U.S. and the EU varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In all cases, clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
EU NCE Exclusivity 
In the EU, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator's data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. Lomitapide has eight years’ data exclusivity and ten years’ marketing exclusivity in the EU from July 31, 2013, the date of the EC’s approval of lomitapide. If approved by the EMA, metreleptin would be entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity by the EU.
EU Drug Review and Approval 
To obtain marketing authorization for a medicinal product in the EU, companies must submit an application for marketing authorization based on the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use ("ICH") Common Technical Document to the regulatory authorities of the EU Member States or to the EMA. Applicants need to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product in the application for marketing authorization. This requires applicants to conduct human clinical trials to generate the necessary clinical data. Moreover, applicants are required to include, as part of the application for marketing authorization, the results of all studies performed and details of all information collected in compliance with an agreed PIP approved by the Pediatric Committee ("PDCO"), or a decision by the EMA granting a product-specific or class waiver for pediatric use or deferral for the conduct of the PIP.
Medicinal products are authorized in the EU through one of several different procedures, either by the regulatory authorities of the EU Member States through the decentralized procedure, mutual recognition procedure, or national procedure, or through the centralized authorization procedure by which the EC takes a decision to grant a marketing authorization following a positive opinion by the EMA.
EU Drug Marketing 
Much like the Anti-Kickback Statue prohibition in the U.S., the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of EU Member States, such as the UK Bribery Act 2010 (the "UK Bribery Act"). Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publically disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
33

The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the EC that is valid for all EU Member States and three of the four EFTA States (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain medicinal products, including medicinal products derived from certain biotechnological processes, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. It is optional for those products that are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or the authorization of which would be in the interest of public. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application by the EMA's CHMP is, in principle, 210 days from receipt of a valid application for marketing authorization. This time period excludes any clock stops when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP and if the applicant requests a re-examination of the CHMP opinion. Accelerated evaluation might be granted, following a substantiated request from the applicant, by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of a major public health interest particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. Justification of what constitutes a major public interest is on a case by case basis. The justification should include the major benefits expected and present the arguments to support the claim that the medicinal product introduces new methods of therapy or improves on existing methods, thereby addressing to a significant extent the greater unmet needs for maintaining and improving public health. In this circumstance of an accelerated assessment, the opinion of the CHMP is given, in principle, within 150 days. Regardless of the assessment procedure, the opinion of the CHMP will be provided to the EC who will take the final decision on the application for centralized marketing authorization of a medicinal product. In light of the United Kingdom’s ("UK") vote in 2016 to leave the EU, the so-called Brexit vote, there may be changes forthcoming in the scope of the centralized approval procedure as the terms of that exit are negotiated between the UK and the EU.
The decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the regulatory authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. One national regulatory authority, the “reference” Member State, selected by the applicant, assesses the application for marketing authorization. As part of this procedure, an applicant submits an application for marketing authorization, or dossier, and related materials, including a draft SmPC, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference EU Member State and the concerned EU Member States. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related SmPC, labeling and package leaflet within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The regulatory authorities of the other EU Member States, the “concerned” Member States, are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territory on the basis of this assessment within 90 days of receipt thereof. The only exception to this obligation arises where the regulatory authorities provide evidence of potential serious risk to public health which would require this authorization to be refused. Similarly, the mutual recognition procedure is based on the acceptance by the regulatory authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the regulatory authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the regulatory authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the regulatory authority of another EU Member State. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related SmPC, labeling and package leaflet within 90 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States, which within 90 days of receipt must each decide whether to approve the assessment report and the related materials. For both the decentralized and mutual recognition procedures, if a concerned EU Member State does not approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures ("CMDh") whose decision is binding on all EU Member States. If the CMDh does not reach an agreement, the disputed points are forwarded to the CHMP. The CHMP then adopts an opinion in the matter, which is forwarded to the EC, which makes the final decision regarding the application for a decentralized or mutual recognition marketing authorization. LOJUXTA was granted a marketing authorization by the EC under the centralized procedure. Because Aegerion was not able to provide comprehensive clinical data on efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use due to the rarity of the disease, and in light of Aegerion’s commitments to conduct an appropriate risk-mitigation program, LOJUXTA was approved under exceptional circumstances. This type of marketing authorization requires an annual reassessment of the risk/benefit of LOJUXTA by the CHMP, for which Amryt is now responsible. As part of the post-marketing commitments to the FDA, Aegerion is conducting an observational cohort study to generate more data on the long-term safety profile of lomitapide in the treatment of patients with HoFH, the patterns of use and compliance and the long-term effectiveness of controlling LDL-C levels. The EMA has required that all patients taking lomitapide in the EU be encouraged to participate in the study, and that the study period be open-ended. Amryt will bear the costs of conducting this study in the EEA and other relevant territories. In the study, physicians will follow each patient to track malignancies, tumors, teratogenicity, hepatic effects, and gastrointestinal adverse reactions, events associated with coagulopathy, major adverse cardiovascular events and death. The EMA also required that a vascular imaging study be conducted to determine the impact of lomitapide on vascular endpoints, which is now the responsibility of Amryt.

EU Orphan Designation and Exclusivity 
The EMA grants orphan designation to promote the development of products that treat life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the EU. In addition, orphan drug designation can be granted only if, for economic reasons, the medicinal product would be unlikely to be developed without incentives and if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the EU of diagnosing, preventing, or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed medicinal product must potentially be of significant benefit to patients affected by the condition. The application for orphan designation must be granted by the EC before an application for marketing authorization of the medicinal product is submitted. Upon grant of marketing authorization for the medicinal products, orphan designation provides ten years of market exclusivity for the orphan medicinal product in the orphan indication. During this ten-year period, with a limited number of exceptions, the regulatory authorities of the EU Member States and the EMA may not accept applications for marketing authorization, accept an application to extend an existing marketing authorization or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products for the same orphan indication. Under an exception, marketing authorization could be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication before the expiry of the ten years if the holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product has given its consent or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. Moreover, the exclusivity period for the original orphan medicinal product may be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Despite the prevalence rate, lomitapide does not have orphan medicinal product exclusivity in the EU for the treatment of HoFH because the EMA views the relevant condition, for orphan drug purposes, to include both HoFH and HeFH. In 2012, metreleptin was granted orphan designation by the EC for the treatment of acquired PL, congenital GL, acquired GL and familial PL. If approved by the EMA, metreleptin would be entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity by the EU.
In the EU, certain patents may qualify for a supplemental protection certificate that would extend patent protection for up to five years after patent expiration upon marketing authorization in the EU. Grant of such supplemental protection certificate is, however, subject to strict conditions and it is not automatic. We believe that our EPO method of use patent covering certain dosing regimens for lomitapide which expires in 2025 may be eligible for up to three years of supplemental protection in certain EPO countries, and we are seeking such protection in the EU Member States, on a country-by-country basis.
Similar to the U.S., marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and/or the regulatory authorities of the EU Member States. This oversight applies both before and after grant of manufacturing and marketing authorizations. It includes control of compliance with EU GMP rules, manufacturing authorizations, pharmacovigilance rules and requirements governing advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution, recordkeeping, importing and exporting of medicinal products.
Failure to comply with the EU Member State laws implementing the EU Community Code on medicinal products and other EU Member State laws that apply to the promotion of medicinal products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the EU Member State authorities. 
European Data Collection
The collection and use of personal health data and other personal information in the EU is governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive as implemented into national laws by the EU Member States. This Directive imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. There is, moreover, a growing trend towards imposition of an obligation of public disclosure of clinical trial data in the EU which adds to the complexity of obligations relating to the processing of health data from clinical trials. Such public disclosure obligations are provided in the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, EMA disclosure initiatives, and voluntary commitments by industry. The Data Protection Directive also includes requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their personal data or personal health data, notification of data processing obligations to the national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive also prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EU Member States that are not considered by the EC to provide an adequate level of data protection. These countries include the U.S. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may interpret the EU Data Protection Directive and national laws differently, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. Guidance developed at both EU level and at the national level in individual EU Member States concerning implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised. The EU General Data Protection Regulation ("EU No. 2016/679"), which will apply beginning May 25, 2018, will introduce new data protection requirements in 
35

the EU and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The EU Data Protection Regulation, which will be applicable two years after the date of its publication in the Official Journal for the European Union, will increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new EU data protection rules. This may be onerous and increase our cost of doing business. 
Expanded Access
In certain countries, drug products approved in the U.S. or EU can be accessed by patients before the drug has obtained marketing approval in such country. There are various forms of this access. They include the actual purchase of product by the purchaser, which is often times the government for patients, on a named patient basis, providing the product free of charge on a named patient basis, and providing the product on a compassionate use basis. Each country has its own laws and regulations that apply to these forms of access and the extent and nature of such laws and regulations vary by country. We have made lomitapide available in Brazil and other countries that allow such use, and we plan to continue to consider access to additional countries in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. When Aegerion acquired metreleptin from AstraZeneca in January 2015, there were a number of patients receiving metreleptin therapy free of charge in certain countries outside the U.S. that allow use of a drug, under a compassionate use or other type of expanded access program, before marketing approval has been obtained in such country. Where permitted in accordance with applicable requirements, we have continued to make metreleptin available free of charge under such program, which has resulted in significant costs to us. In 2016, we began generating revenues from named patient sales of metreleptin in certain markets where named patient sales of metreleptin are possible and to the extent permitted by applicable law and local regulatory authorities. In particular, we are in the process of converting GL and PL patients currently in the expanded access program in France to a paid program under the Autorisation Temporaire d’Utilisation (Temporary Authorization for Use). Metreleptin has also been approved for reimbursement by the Turkish SGK, and we are providing metreleptin on a named patient basis for GL patients, including congenital GL patients, and other subsets of lipodystrophy patients, including patients with congenital leptin deficiency, subject to individual assessment in response to unsolicited requests from clinicians. 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists regarding the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability and adequacy of third-party reimbursement. Third-party payers include government health administrative authorities, including authorities at the U.S. federal and state level, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for, examining the medical necessity of, and assessing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services.
In the U.S., the Medicare program provides health insurance for people who are 65 or older, as well as certain people with disabilities and other conditions irrespective of their age. The Medicare program is funded by the federal government and administered by the CMS. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 ("MMA"), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare Part D is a voluntary prescription drug benefit, through which beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities under contract with CMS for coverage of certain outpatient prescription drugs. Medicare Part D generally provides coverage for medically necessary self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that do not need to be administered by a healthcare practitioner). JUXTAPID and MYALEPT may be covered under Medicare Part D. Coverage and reimbursement for outpatient drugs under Part D is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs the plan will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. 
The availability of coverage under Medicare Part D may affect demand for JUXTAPID and MYALEPT. In order for JUXTAPID and MYALEPT to remain on or be included on the formularies of Part D prescription drug plans, we may have to offer discounts on the price of those products. In addition, manufacturers, including Aegerion, are required to provide a 50% discount on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the so-called “donut hole” in their drug benefits in a particular year (i.e., a coverage gap between initial coverage and catastrophic coverage). However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payers. We believe that investigations 
36

and enforcement actions by certain government agencies have caused a reduction in contributions to these third-party patient organizations, which may prevent these organizations from providing adequate financial assistance, including assistance with co-payment obligations, to individuals who would otherwise be unable to afford our products. As a result, Medicare Part D patients may not be able to afford their out-of-pocket co-payments for our products. In 2017, for example, we believe that a considerable number of JUXTAPID patients who were covered by Medicare Part D ceased treatment with JUXTAPID, due to reductions in contributions to patient assistance programs operated by independent charitable 501(c)(3) organizations, which resulted in prior sources of financial support for these patients being less available.
Medicaid is a health insurance program with mandatory coverage for certain low-income children, families, pregnant women, and people with disabilities. States also have the option of expanding Medicaid coverage to low-income individuals generally and many states have done so. Medicaid is jointly funded by the federal and state governments, but administered by the states. In general, state Medicaid programs are required to cover drugs and biologics of manufacturers that have entered into a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement, as discussed further below, although such drugs and biologics may be subject to prior authorization or other utilization controls.
Coverage of drugs and biologics by private health insurance varies. Private payers may use a variety of utilization management techniques designed to control costs, including requiring pre-approval of coverage for drug therapies before reimbursing healthcare providers or patients that use such therapies. In addition, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be provided. Coverage may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.
Government and private third-party payers have a variety of methodologies for paying for drugs and biologics. Payers are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price ("AMP") or actual acquisition cost. Recent changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, effective April 2016, require state Medicaid programs to reimburse certain brand name covered outpatient drugs at actual acquisition cost plus a dispensing fee. The impact of these evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of providers to furnish JUXTAPID or MYALEPT or other products we may market and the prices we can command for these products is difficult to predict.
We participate in various government programs or contracts that require us to calculate and report certain prices for our products to government agencies or provide rebates or discounted pricing on products purchased to certain purchasers or government payers. The requirements for calculating prices and rebates are complex and subject to change. We may also have reimbursement obligations or be subject to penalties if we fail to provide timely and accurate information to the government, pay the correct rebates or offer the correct discounted pricing.
We participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the DHHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The Healthcare Reform Act made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers' rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for "line extensions" (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, creating a new methodology by which rebates are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The Healthcare Reform Act also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. 
Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we are required to pay a rebate for each unit of our product reimbursed by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data that we report on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. We may also participate in state Medicaid supplemental rebate programs which require payment of an incremental rebate to state Medicaid programs for covered utilization of our products. Price reductions as well as price increases that exceed the rate of inflation for our products, such as the price increase for MYALEPT in February 2015, may result in increasing the rebates we are required to pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or state Medicaid supplemental rebate programs and the discounts we are required to offer under the Public Health Service ("PHS") 340B drug pricing discount program (the "340B Program"), as discussed below. As a result of the substantial price increase for MYALEPT in February 2015, we continue to expect a significant gross-to-net adjustment for Medicaid rebates which will offset the majority of revenues from Medicaid and negatively impact net product sales in future quarters, since Medicaid rebates directly reduce our net product sales. The degree of such impact on our overall financial performance will depend on the percentage of MYALEPT 
37

patients that have Medicaid as their primary insurance coverage and the quantity of units ordered per patient. To date, approximately 34% of patients prescribed MYALEPT have been Medicaid beneficiaries. The number of patients prescribed MYALEPT in the future who are Medicaid beneficiaries could be higher than historical rates. 
To maintain coverage of our products under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B, we are required to extend significant discounts to certain “covered entities” (defined by statute to include certain types of hospitals and other healthcare providers that receive federal grants) that purchase products under the 340B Program. The 340B Program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge such covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturers’ covered outpatient drugs. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the AMP and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. “Orphan drugs” (those designated under section 526 of the FDCA, such as JUXTAPID and MYALEPT) are exempt from the ceiling price requirements with respect to drugs purchased by certain covered entities (i.e., rural referral centers, sole community hospitals, critical access hospitals, and free-standing cancer hospitals). The Healthcare Reform Act also obligates the Health Resources and Services Administration ("HRSA"), the agency which administers the 340B Program, to promulgate various regulations and implement processes to improve the integrity of the 340B Program. The status of new and pending regulations and guidance is uncertain under the new presidential administration. 
Drug products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the FSS. FSS participation is required for a drug product to be covered and reimbursed by certain federal agencies and for coverage under Medicaid, Medicare Part B and the 340B Program. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that a manufacturer charges its most-favored non-federal customer for its product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the Tricare Retail Pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing (known as the federal ceiling price) and may be subject to an additional discount if pricing increases more than the rate of inflation. Aegerion participates in the FSS, and has had an FSS contract in place for its products since 2016. Aegerion also participates in the Tricare Retail Pharmacy program, under which we pay quarterly rebates on utilization of JUXTAPID and MYALEPT when the products are dispensed through the Tricare Retail Pharmacy network to Tricare beneficiaries. 
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
In recent years, additional laws have resulted in direct or indirect reimbursement reductions for certain Medicare providers, including: 

• | The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken.


• | The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.


• | The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required that the CMS reduce the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule by 2% in 2013, which served as a base for 2014 and subsequent years. In addition, effective January 1, 2014, CMS also began bundling the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting. 

These laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
38

Further, in the U.S., the cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payer interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the increasing influence of managed care (and related implementation of managed care strategies to control utilization), additional federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to regulate pricing of drugs, limit coverage of drugs or reduce reimbursement for drugs, public scrutiny and the presidential administration’s agenda to control the price of pharmaceuticals through government negotiations of drug prices in Medicare Part D and importation of cheaper products from abroad.
In addition, in many foreign countries, including several of the key markets where we do business, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, in the EU, the sole legal instrument at the EU level governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products is Council Directive 89/105/EEC (the "Price Transparency Directive"). The aim of this Directive is to ensure that pricing and reimbursement mechanisms established in the EU Member States are transparent and objective, do not hinder the free movement of and trade in medicinal products in the EU, and do not hinder, prevent or distort competition on the market. The Price Transparency Directive does not provide any guidance concerning the specific criteria on the basis of which pricing and reimbursement decisions are to be made in individual EU Member States, nor does it have any direct consequence for pricing nor reimbursement levels in individual EU Member States. The EU Member States are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, and to control the prices and/or reimbursement levels of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the medicinal product, or alternatively adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company responsible for placing the medicinal product on the market, including volume-based arrangements, caps and reference pricing mechanisms. 
Reference pricing used by various EU member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, if any, to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally published and actual prices tend to be significantly lower. This has largely proven to be the case for lomitapide and we expect to be the case for metreleptin, if approved in the EU. Publication of discounts by third-party payers or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries.
Health Technology Assessment ("HTA") of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden. The HTA process in the EU Member States is governed by the national laws of these countries. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact, and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the regulatory authorities of individual EU Member States. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product vary between EU Member States. A negative HTA of one of our products by a leading and recognized HTA body, such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ("NICE") in the United Kingdom, could not only undermine our ability to obtain reimbursement for such product in the EU Member State in which such negative assessment was issued, but also in other EU Member States. For example, EU Member States that have not yet developed HTA mechanisms could rely to some extent on the HTA performed in countries with a developed HTA framework, such as the United Kingdom, when adopting decisions concerning the pricing and reimbursement of a specific medicinal product.
In 2011, Directive 2011/24/EU was adopted at the EU level. This Directive concerns the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare. The Directive is intended to establish rules for facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare in the EU. It also provides for the establishment of a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual EU Member States. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This could lead to harmonization between EU Member States of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTA and their impact on pricing and reimbursement decisions.
To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, including the EU Member States, we may be required to conduct studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other therapies that are considered the local 
39

standard of care. In the case of metreleptin, in preparation for seeking reimbursement and pricing approval, if metreleptin is approved by the EMA, we are conducting local and regional studies to ascertain the impact of metreleptin on morbidity, mortality and patients' quality of life, in order to maximize the product's value proposition to payers. There can be no assurance that any country will allow favorable pricing, reimbursement and market access conditions for any of our products, or that it will be feasible to conduct additional cost-effectiveness studies, if required.
In certain of the EU Member States, products that are designated as orphan medicinal products may be exempted or waived from having to provide certain clinical, cost-effectiveness and other economic data in connection with their filings for pricing/reimbursement approval. As noted above, LOJUXTA was not granted orphan designation by the EMA for the treatment of HoFH. As such, it is not eligible for benefits related to orphan designation. As a result, Amryt may not be able to provide all of the data required to obtain pricing/reimbursement approvals in certain EU Member States, which has and could, in the future, result in delays of pricing/reimbursement approvals for LOJUXTA, LOJUXTA not obtaining pricing/reimbursement approval at all, or LOJUXTA obtaining approvals at less than acceptable levels or with significant restrictions on use or reimbursement, all of which thereby potentially negatively impacting sales milestone and royalty payments Aegerion receives under its license agreement with Amryt.
U. S. Healthcare Reform
Our revenues and operations could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy in the U.S. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to health care availability, the method of delivery or payment for health care products and services could negatively impact our business, operations and financial condition. As noted above, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. For example, the Healthcare Reform Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The law contains a number of provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drug products and/or that could potentially reduce the demand for our products such as:

• | increasing drug rebates under state Medicaid programs for brand name prescription drugs and extending those rebates to Medicaid managed care; and


• | requiring drug manufacturers to provide a 50% discount on Medicare Part D brand name prescription drugs sold to Medicare beneficiaries whose prescription drug costs cause the beneficiaries to be subject to the Medicare Part D coverage cap (i.e., the so-called donut hole).

In 2012, the Supreme Court of the U.S. heard challenges to the constitutionality of the individual mandate and the viability of certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. The Supreme Court’s decision upheld most of the Healthcare Reform Act and determined that requiring individuals to maintain “minimum essential” health insurance coverage or pay a penalty to the Internal Revenue Service was within Congress’s constitutional taxing authority. As a result of tax reform legislation passed in late December 2017, the individual mandate has been eliminated; the long ranging effects on the viability of the Healthcare Reform Act are unknown at this time. 
On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Healthcare Reform Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Healthcare Reform Act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the Healthcare Reform Act. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the Healthcare Reform Act for plans sold through such marketplaces. Further, each chamber of Congress has put forth multiple bills this year designed to repeal or repeal and replace portions of the Healthcare Reform Act. In 2018, Congress may consider other legislation to repeal and replace elements of the Healthcare Reform Act. Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the Healthcare Reform Act; litigation and legislation over the Healthcare Reform Act are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Healthcare Reform Act was enacted that, directly or indirectly, affect or are likely to affect, the pharmaceutical industry and the commercialization of our products, including the Budget Control Act of 2011, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 as discussed above.
40

Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid healthcare costs. For example, the U.S. government has passed legislation requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide rebates and discounts to certain entities and governmental payers to participate in federal healthcare programs. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
Promotional Activities and Interactions with Healthcare Providers and Patients
The FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate promotional claims about prescription drug and biological products through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. A product generally cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. In general, after approval, a drug product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, the EC, and the regulatory authorities of the EU Member States or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. Moreover, the promotion of prescription-only medicinal products to non-healthcare professionals is prohibited in the EU. In the U.S., healthcare professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs and biologics for “off-label” uses (i.e., uses not described in the drug’s labeling) because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. A manufacturer may not promote a drug or biologic for off-label use, but under very specific conditions, it may be permissible for a manufacturer to engage in non-promotional, truthful, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information. If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of the DHHS, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug or biological products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. For example, as described in detail in the “Legal Proceedings” section of this Annual Report, to resolve investigations conducted by the DOJ and SEC regarding Aegerion’s U.S. commercial activities and disclosures related to JUXTAPID, Aegerion is required, among other things, to pay approximately $40.1 million in aggregate penalties over three years, which includes $7.2 million in restitution, a civil penalty of $4.1 million to be paid to the SEC pursuant to the SEC Judgment, and $28.8 million to be paid pursuant to the DOJ Civil Settlement Agreement.
Other Healthcare Laws Affecting Our Business
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third party payers will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third party payers, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the U.S., these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.

• | The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it.


• | The federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to

41

payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. Our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law.

• | HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers, or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 ("HITECH"), and their respective implementing regulations, which impose, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.


• | The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Healthcare Reform Act, which imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.


• | Analogous state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payor. Such laws are enforced by various state agencies and through private actions. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. Such data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, as Aegerion’s operations have been as described below, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. As noted above, in September 2017, Aegerion entered into Settlement to resolve investigations conducted by the DOJ and the SEC regarding Aegerion’s U.S. commercial activities and disclosures related to JUXTAPID, and on January 30, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge sentenced Aegerion after the judge accepted Aegerion’s guilty criminal plea. Aegerion is required, among other things, to pay approximately $40.1 million in aggregate penalties over three years, and has been put on probation for three years. Aegerion is also subject to a five-year CIA, three-year DPA related to HIPPA compliance, and a pending civil consent decree with the FDA and the DOJ relating to the JUXTAPID REMS program. See the “Legal Proceedings” section of this Annual Report for further information regarding ongoing investigations, including the Settlement, and other legal proceedings. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. 
The number and complexity of both federal and state laws continues to increase, and additional governmental resources are being used to enforce these laws and to prosecute companies and individuals who are believed to be violating them. In particular, 
42

the Healthcare Reform Act includes a number of provisions aimed at strengthening the government’s ability to pursue anti-kickback and false claims cases against pharmaceutical manufacturers and other healthcare entities, including substantially increased funding for healthcare fraud enforcement activities, enhanced investigative powers, and amendments to the False Claims Act that make it easier for the government and whistleblowers to pursue cases for alleged kickback and false claim violations. While it is too early to predict what effect these changes will have on our business, we anticipate that government scrutiny of pharmaceutical sales and marketing practices will continue for the foreseeable future and subject us to the risk of government investigations and enforcement actions. For example, federal enforcement agencies recently have shown interest in pharmaceutical companies’ product and patient assistance programs, including manufacturer reimbursement support services and relationships with specialty pharmacies. Some of these investigations have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. 
EU Advertising and Promotion
In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products is also subject to EU Member States’ laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation of individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s SmPC as approved by the regulatory authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. It forms an intrinsic and integral part of the marketing authorization granted for the medicinal product. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion. The off-label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The applicable laws at the EU level and in the individual EU Member States also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
Interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct in the individual EU Member States. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EU Member States. One example is the UK Bribery Act. This Act applies to any company incorporated in or “carrying on business” in the UK, irrespective of where in the world the alleged bribery activity occurs. This Act could have implications for our interactions with physicians both in and outside the UK. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her regulatory professional organization, and/or the authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Additional Laws and Regulations Governing International Operations 
For other countries outside of the EU and the U.S, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
Our international operations are subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") which prohibits U.S. corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We also may be implicated under the FCPA by the activities of our partners, collaborators, contract research organizations, vendors or other agents. The FCPA also requires us, as a public company, to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all of our transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. An aspect of the SEC’s investigation into Aegerion’s 
43

disclosures and activities relates to alleged FCPA violations in Brazil.  These potential violations are excluded from the Settlement of the JUXTAPID Investigations. 
Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions against other companies. 
Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the U.S., or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we are successful in expanding our presence outside of the U.S., such expansion will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the U.S., which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs. 
Our international operations could also be subject to compliance with national laws of the individual EU Member States, such as the UK Bribery Act. The UK Bribery Act applies to any company incorporated in or “carrying on business” in the UK, irrespective of where in the world the offending conduct occurs. The UK Bribery Act prohibits the provision of an “advantage” intended to induce or reward “improper performance” of the recipient’s function. Offenses under the UK Bribery Act include the offer, promise or provision of a bribe to any person including non-UK government officials and private persons, as well as the request, acceptance or agreement to receive a bribe. The failure by a company to prevent third parties from providing a bribe on its behalf could also constitute an offense under the UK Bribery Act. This Act applies to bribery activities both in the public and private sector. Liability in relation to breaches of the UK Bribery Act is strict. This means that it is unnecessary to demonstrate elements of a corrupt state of mind. However, a defense of having in place adequate procedures designed to prevent bribery is available.
We are also subject to compliance with the anti-bribery laws of other countries, including Brazil. Our activities outside the U.S. or those of our employees, licensees, distributors, manufacturers, clinical research organizations, or other third parties who act on our behalf or with whom we do business could subject us to investigation or prosecution under foreign or U.S. laws. For example, federal and São Paulo authorities in Brazil are each conducting an investigation to determine whether there have been any violations of Brazilian laws related to the sales of JUXTAPID in Brazil. See Part I, Item 3 - “Legal Proceedings” section of this Annual Report for further information regarding these investigations and other legal proceedings.
We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations as a public company in Canada and the U.S., including laws relating to the oversight activities of the Canadian securities administrators and the SEC, and the rules and regulations of NASDAQ, on which our shares are traded. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Canadian securities administrators, the SEC, and other bodies that have jurisdiction over the form and content of our Consolidated Financial Statements and other public disclosure are issuing and amending proposed and existing pronouncements designed to ensure that companies disclose relevant and transparent information relating to their respective businesses. 
The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA's accounting provisions.
Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used or that we may use in the future in connection with our development work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights or acquisitions may be subject to national or supranational antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted. 
Research and Development Costs
A significant portion of our operating expenses are related to research and development. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our total company-sponsored research and development expenses were $49.0 million, $14.8 
44

million, and $9.8 million, respectively. See the Products in Development section above and in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of this Annual Report.
Significant Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2017, two customers (our current specialty pharmacy in the U.S. for both products and former specialty pharmacy in the U.S. for JUXTAPID) accounted for 70% of our net revenues, and of these two pharmacies, one accounted for 63% of our accounts receivable balance.
