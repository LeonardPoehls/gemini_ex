Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing drugs to treat patients with serious cardiometabolic diseases caused by lipid disorders. Our goal is to become the premier company offering treatments for these inadequately treated diseases. We are advancing a mature pipeline of four novel drugs with the potential to treat multiple diseases. Our drugs, volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, are all based on antisense technology developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, which owns approximately 68% of our outstanding common stock. Our most advanced drug, volanesorsen, is currently under review by regulatory agencies in the United States, or U.S., European Union, or EU, and Canada for the treatment of people with familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date of August 30, 2018 and scheduled advisory committee meeting for May 10, 2018. In Canada, our New Drug Submission, or NDS, was granted Priority Review by Health Canada. FCS is a severe, rare, genetically defined lipid disorder characterized by extremely elevated levels of triglycerides. FCS has life-threatening consequences such as acute pancreatitis and the lives of patients with these diseases are impacted daily by the associated symptoms. In our clinical program, we have observed consistent and substantial (>70%) decreases in triglycerides and improvements in other manifestations of FCS, including pancreatitis attacks and abdominal pain. We believe the safety and efficacy data from the volanesorsen program demonstrate a favorable risk-benefit profile for patients with FCS. We are preparing for approval and launch of volanesorsen in mid-2018. Volanesorsen is also in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of familial partial lipodystrophy, or FPL. Our other three drugs are currently in Phase 2 clinical development.
 
We have made substantial progress in assembling the infrastructure to commercialize our drugs globally for rare disease indications with an initial focus on lipid specialists as the primary call point. A key element of our commercial strategy is to provide the specialized, patient-centric support required to successfully address rare disease patient populations. We believe our focus on treating patients with inadequately addressed lipid disorders will allow us to partner efficiently and effectively with the specialized medical community that supports these patients. In the future, this global infrastructure may support commercialization of additional drugs within and outside the cardiometabolic arena.
 
To maximize the commercial potential of two of the drugs in our pipeline, we initiated a strategic collaboration with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, for the development and commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. We believe Novartis brings significant resources and expertise to the collaboration that can accelerate our ability to deliver these potential therapies to the large populations of patients who have high cardiovascular risk due to inadequately treated lipid disorders. As part of our collaboration, we received $75.0 million in an upfront option payment, of which we retained $60.0 million and paid $15.0 million to Ionis as a sublicense fee. Under our agreement with Novartis, after we complete Phase 2 development of each of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx (data planned for the second half of 2018) and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx (data planned for  2019), and if, on a drug-by-drug basis, Novartis exercises its option to license a drug and pays us the $150.0 million license fee to do so, Novartis would conduct and pay for a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study in high-risk patients and, if approved, commercialize each such licensed drug worldwide. Novartis will have 60 days following the end of the applicable end-of-Phase 2 meeting to exercise its option for each of these drugs. We plan to co-commercialize any licensed drug commercialized by Novartis in selected markets, under terms and conditions that we plan to negotiate with Novartis in the future, through the specialized sales force we are building to commercialize volanesorsen. Overall, we are eligible to receive license fees, milestone payments and royalties on sales of each drug Novartis licenses if and when it meets the development, regulatory and sales milestones specified in our agreement. We will share any license fees, milestone payments and royalties equally with Ionis.
 
Cardiometabolic disease, which includes cardiovascular diseases and metabolic diseases, is the number one cause of death globally. According to the American Heart Association, or AHA, cardiovascular disease, or CVD, alone accounts for 17.3 million deaths per year globally, a number that the AHA expects to grow to more than 23.6 million by 2030. Further, between 2010 and 2030, total direct medical costs of CVD in the United States alone are projected to triple from $272.5 billion to $818.1 billion, according to the AHA. In addition, the number of individuals with metabolic diseases, including diabetes, is rising dramatically. According to a 2010 study published in Population Health Metrics, the number of people in the United States with diabetes is projected to grow from approximately 20 million in 2010 to between 37 million and 56 million by 2030. Cardiometabolic risk factors include metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity and insulin resistance. Lipid risk factors driven by abnormalities in lipid molecules or the processing of lipid molecules contribute to cardiometabolic diseases, with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C, being the most widely recognized. Despite the availability of powerful drugs to lower LDL-C, many people remain at significant risk due to other lipid disorders that are not adequately addressed with current therapies. We believe this treatment gap beyond LDL lowering represents a significant commercial opportunity both in rare and in broader patient populations.

Each of the four drugs in our pipeline targets the specific ribonucleic acid, or RNA, that encodes for a unique protein associated with lipid dysfunction, robustly and selectively inhibiting the production of such protein. These drugs were designed and developed at Ionis, and use Ionis' proprietary antisense technology, which is a potent and specific way of reducing expression of disease-causing proteins. Specifically, our drugs utilize Ionis' generation 2+ antisense technology, which is designed for increased potency and enhanced safety characteristics relative to Ionis' generation 2.0 technology. Additionally, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx utilize Ionis' advanced Ligand Conjugated Antisense, or LICA, technology. LICA technology conjugates specific chemical structures or molecules to antisense drugs to increase the efficiency of drug uptake in a particular tissue. We believe the enhancements from LICA technology have the potential to allow for less frequent administration and significantly lower doses, providing greater patient convenience. Phase 1 studies of all three of Akcea's LICA drugs have shown that doses up to 30-fold lower than non-LICA drugs result in consistent target reductions and a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Our current pipeline includes drugs with the potential to treat patients with a wide range of lipid disorders associated with cardiometabolic disease that other technologies, such as small molecules and antibodies, have not been able to adequately address. Our development approach and commercialization strategy include:
 
 
● | transforming the lives of patients with serious diseases that are currently inadequately addressed;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | addressing the root cause of each disease;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | maximizing near-term and long-term commercial opportunities; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | optimizing the efficiency of our sales, marketing and patient support infrastructure by focusing on rare and specialty diseases.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Our clinical pipeline contains novel drugs with the potential to treat inadequately addressed lipid disorders beyond elevated LDL-C that are contributing to the dramatic increase in the incidence of cardiometabolic disease, such as elevated triglycerides, oxidized phospholipids and other lipoproteins such as lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a).
 
 
● | Volanesorsen. In the third quarter of 2017, we filed for marketing authorization for volanesorsen to treat patients with FCS in the U.S., EU and Canada. FCS is characterized by extremely elevated triglyceride levels and a high risk of life-threatening pancreatitis. Patients with FCS live with daily and chronic manifestations of their disease that negatively affect their lives, including severe, recurrent abdominal pain, cognitive impairment and fatigue. Volanesorsen is also in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of FPL. We plan to report data from the FPL Phase 3 study, called the BROADEN study, in 2019. Volanesorsen acts to reduce triglyceride levels by inhibiting the production of apolipoprotein C-III, or apoC-III, a protein that is a key regulator of triglyceride clearance. If approved, we plan to globally commercialize volanesorsen ourselves for both FCS and FPL.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In 2017, we completed the Phase 3 program for volanesorsen to treat patients with FCS. The Phase 3 program consisted of two studies, the APPROACH study and the COMPASS study. The APPROACH study, a one-year randomized, placebo-controlled study in 66 patients with FCS (average incoming triglycerides of 2,209 mg/dL), achieved its primary endpoint of reduction in triglycerides at three months, with a 77% mean reduction in triglycerides, which translated into a 1,712 mg/dL mean absolute triglyceride reduction in volanesorsen-treated patients. We observed that 50% of treated patients achieved triglyceride levels below 500 mg/dL, a commonly accepted threshold for pancreatitis risk. In addition, in the APPROACH study, treatment with volanesorsen was associated with a statistically significant reduced rate of pancreatitis attacks in the group of patients who had the highest incidence of pre-study pancreatitis, and reduced abdominal pain in patients reporting pain before treatment in the study. The triglyceride-lowering effects we observed were maintained throughout the 12-month study period.
 
The COMPASS study, a six-month randomized placebo-controlled study in 113 patients with very high triglycerides (>500 mg/dL), also achieved its primary endpoint of reduction in triglycerides at three months, with a 71% mean reduction in triglycerides. In the COMPASS study, treatment with volanesorsen was associated with a statistically significant reduction in pancreatitis attacks. The data from the COMPASS and APPROACH studies is consistent with and supports the robust triglyceride lowering we observed in the Phase 2 program for volanesorsen.
 
The most common adverse event in patients in the studies was injection site reactions, which were mostly mild. In addition, declines in platelet counts were observed in many patients and some patients discontinued the study because of platelet declines. These platelet declines were not clinically significant in most patients and were generally well managed with monitoring and dose adjustment. Some patients also discontinued participation in the APPROACH study due to other non-serious adverse events, including sweating and chills, severe fatigue, rash and injection site reaction. In the APPROACH study and the open label extension study, the potentially treatment-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, observed were serious platelet events (grade 4 thrombocytopenia). These events resolved without complication after cessation of dosing. Enhanced monitoring was implemented during the study to support early detection and management of these issues. Since implementation of the enhanced monitoring, serious platelet events have been infrequent. In the COMPASS study, the most common adverse event in the volanesorsen-treated group of patients was injection site reactions, which were mostly mild, and the potentially treatment-related SAE of serum sickness reaction where the patient fully recovered. There have been no deaths and no treatment-related bleeding or cardiovascular events in any volanesorsen clinical study.

We recently initiated a global early access program, or EAP, for people with FCS. Early access, sometimes referred to as "compassionate use", is the use of an investigational medicinal product outside of a clinical trial that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition. Our EAP program is being initiated on a country-by-country basis globally and is currently available in select countries in Europe.
 
The remainder of our pipeline incorporates Ionis' LICA technology.
 
 
● | AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. We are developing AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx for patients who are at significant risk of CVD because of their elevated levels of Lp(a). AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx inhibits the production of the apolipoprotein(a), or apo(a), protein, thereby reducing Lp(a). Apo(a) is a form of low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, that is very atherogenic (promoting the formation of plaques in the arteries) and very thrombogenic (promoting the formation of blood clots). We have started a Phase 2b dose-ranging study of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia(a), which in this clinical study we have defined as individuals with levels of Lp(a) greater than 60 mg/dL, and established CVD. We expect data from this study in the second half of 2018. We have initiated a strategic collaboration with Novartis for this drug. In this collaboration, we intend to complete the above-referenced Phase 2b study. Following completion of this study, Novartis has an option to license the drug. If Novartis exercises its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, Novartis plans to conduct and pay for a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study in high-risk patients and, if approved, to commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx worldwide.

● | AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx. We are developing AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx to treat multiple lipid disorders. In preclinical studies, an analog of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx inhibited the production of the angiopoietin-like 3, or ANGPTL3, protein in the liver, inhibiting liver fat accumulation and lowering blood levels of triglycerides, LDL-C and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or VLDL-C. We have completed a Phase 1/2 program for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in people with elevated triglycerides. We reported results for the initial cohort from this study at the AHA meeting in November 2016 and published the data in the New England Journal of Medicine. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we initiated a study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, with metabolic complications which include hypertriglyceridemia, type 2 diabetes or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. We expect data from this study in 2019. Further, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we initiated a study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with rare hyperlipidemias, including patients with FCS. If we find that AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx can effectively lower triglyceride levels in patients with rare hyperlipidemias, including patients with FCS, through a different mechanism of action from volanesorsen, it may represent an opportunity to expand our FCS franchise. We expect data from this study in 2018. As part of our exploratory rare hyperlipidemia clinical program, we are also studying AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with FPL and in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HoFH.

● | AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. We are developing AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx to inhibit the production of apoC-III, the same protein inhibited by volanesorsen, for the broad population of patients who have cardiometabolic disease due to their elevated triglyceride levels. We believe that the enhancements offered by Ionis' LICA technology can provide greater patient convenience by allowing for significantly lower doses and less frequent administration, compared to volanesorsen. We conducted a Phase 1/2 study of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in people with elevated triglycerides and reported positive results from this study in the second half of 2017. We have initiated a strategic collaboration with Novartis for this drug. In this collaboration, we intend to complete the Phase 2 program required to define the appropriate dose and regimen to support a planned cardiovascular outcome study. We recently initiated a Phase 2b dose-ranging study of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and established CVD and plan to report data from this study in 2019. At the completion of Phase 2 development, Novartis has an option to license the drug. If Novartis exercises its option to license AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, Novartis plans to conduct and pay for a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study in high-risk patients and, if approved, to commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx worldwide.

Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to become the premier company offering treatments for previously inadequately treated lipid disorders. The critical components of our business strategy to achieve this goal include the following:

● | Successfully complete development, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize volanesorsen in two orphan indications. We are focused on rapidly and efficiently developing and commercializing volanesorsen for the treatment of patients with FCS and FPL. There are limited therapeutic options available for these patients, who suffer from serious health issues including heightened risk of premature death. Volanesorsen has completed a Phase 3 clinical program for the treatment of FCS and is currently being investigated in the Phase 3 BROADEN clinical study for the treatment of FPL. We announced data from the APPROACH study in FCS patients in March 2017, and the COMPASS study in patients with high triglycerides in December 2016. We filed for regulatory approval in the U.S., EU and Canada in this indication in the third quarter of 2017 and are preparing for commercialization in mid-2018. Enrollment in the BROADEN study is ongoing and we plan to report data in 2019.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursue indications that drive the greatest near and long-term value. We seek to maximize near-term and long-term commercial opportunities through development paths in both orphan and broader patient populations. We are developing our first drug for the treatment of orphan lipid disorders, which may provide a more rapid path to marketing authorization, nearer-term commercial value and more immediate clinical benefit for the patients with the greatest need and their physicians. We are pursuing this strategy with our pipeline as well, in particular with AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, which we are developing for both broad and rare diseases.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advance multiple novel clinical-stage drugs to commercialization and further grow our pipeline. Our pipeline of antisense drugs currently contains four clinical-stage novel therapies that we plan to develop and commercialize by ourselves or in conjunction with a partner, such as Novartis, for multiple indications driven by lipid disorders. To sustain our goal of being the premier lipid disorder company, we also plan to actively replenish our pipeline as our current drugs advance through development. For example, we will have the opportunity to potentially license antisense drugs that Ionis advances to treat rare cardiometabolic and rare inherited metabolic diseases under our right of first negotiation that Ionis granted us.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Build a leading, fully integrated, independent development and commercialization organization with a specialized and focused global team centered around a high touch patient and physician experience. As our drug pipeline and commercialization efforts mature, we plan to strategically expand our internal development and regulatory capabilities. Further, we are currently building our own global commercial organization. We are starting with a small, highly focused commercial organization for volanesorsen. This organization will work closely with the same specialists who are participating in developing our drugs, including lipid specialists, specialized endocrinologists and pancreatologists. We plan to efficiently manage this organization to access additional markets as our commercial opportunities for both volanesorsen and our other drugs expand into additional patient populations. We plan to provide high touch patient and healthcare provider support through dedicated case management providing reimbursement assistance, as well as by establishing partnerships with specialty pharmacies, injection training, routine platelet monitoring and dietary counseling, which we believe will enable strong integration with treating physicians and facilitate patient uptake and compliance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Create value through strategic collaborations, such as our strategic collaboration with Novartis, to drive drugs to their fullest potential. We believe that each of the drugs in our pipeline can be developed for multiple lipid disorders, some of which have very large patient populations. In these patient populations, large, costly, late-stage clinical development programs, as well as large sales forces, are required to maximize a drug's commercial potential. As a result, in some cases, partnering with a large organization with global scale may be the optimal approach for maximizing the potential of drugs in these indications. As an example, we have initiated a strategic collaboration with Novartis for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, to provide us with an opportunity to move rapidly to Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome studies with both drugs, which should enhance the commercial potential of each drug. We also plan to co-commercialize these two drugs in selected markets, under terms and conditions that we plan to negotiate with Novartis in the future, through the specialized sales force we are building to commercialize volanesorsen. We believe Novartis brings significant resources and expertise to the collaboration that can accelerate our ability to deliver these potential therapies to the large populations of patients who have high cardiovascular risk due to inadequately treated lipid disorders.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commercial Approach
 
We plan to commercialize volanesorsen ourselves globally, with a specialized and comprehensive patient-centric approach. Our orphan-focused commercial model will include a small highly focused salesforce in each country that we are targeting, complemented by medical affairs and patient and healthcare provider services. We plan to provide high touch patient and healthcare provider support through reimbursement assistance, partnerships with specialty pharmacies, injection training, routine platelet monitoring and dietary counseling, which we believe will enable strong integration with treating physicians and facilitate patient uptake and compliance. Reimbursement assistance may include activities such as a reimbursement hotline, patient assistance, co-pay assistance through foundations and insurance verification. We plan to include dedicated case managers as part of our support team who will work directly with patients, caregivers and healthcare providers to help patients start and stay on therapy. Our global commercial organization is initially focused on our nearest-term opportunity with volanesorsen to treat patients with FCS. Our initial plan is to focus on lipid specialists, specialized endocrinologists and pancreatologists as our primary call points. At the outset, we plan to focus our commercial efforts in the U.S., Canada and EU, and intend to expand over time to other relevant geographies. We believe the relatively small number of specialized physicians treating FCS patients will allow us to address this market with a nimble, scalable organization. We are currently identifying patients and having them referred to specialists for treatment, which we believe will facilitate successful commercialization. Building awareness of this orphan disease among not only lipid specialists, but also referring physicians, is a key element of our pre-commercial and commercial plans. We are focused on disease education and market access, with the goal of ensuring that identified patients can most effectively obtain our drugs once commercialized. We are also creating the specialized support required to potentially address other rare disease patient populations.
 
We plan to commercialize by ourselves any approved drugs with a rare disease or specialty focus. We may enter into additional strategic relationships to commercialize certain of our drugs, particularly in indications with large patient populations, as evidenced by our collaboration with Novartis. We believe Novartis brings significant resources and expertise to the collaboration that can accelerate our ability to deliver AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx to the large populations of patients who have high cardiovascular risk due to inadequately treated lipid disorders. We also plan to co-commercialize any such drug in selected markets, under terms and conditions that we plan to negotiate with Novartis in the future, through the specialized sales force we are building to commercialize volanesorsen.
 
Integrated Development and Commercial Opportunities
 
Our drugs are designed to target a variety of lipid disorders, present in both orphan and broad patient populations, which available therapies do not adequately address. We are initially focused on developing volanesorsen and AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx for orphan indications that will not require large cardiovascular outcome studies. The smaller, orphan-size populations allow a potentially rapid path to commercialization and we believe will allow us to address the commercial market with a nimble, scalable organization. At the same time, we initiated a strategic collaboration with Novartis for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, allowing development of these drugs in larger populations with the potential to expand the commercial opportunity.
 
While preparing to commercialize volanesorsen, we are building relationships with specialist physicians. These specialists influence and drive treatment practice across lipid disorders. Accordingly, we believe that we will be able to leverage these relationships in commercializing all of the drugs in our pipeline.
 
Technology Overview
 
Antisense Technology
 
Ionis discovered each of the drugs in our pipeline using its innovative antisense technology platform. Antisense technology is based on the use of synthetic nucleic acid sequences, which are primarily used to interrupt the production of a specified protein by targeting the specific corresponding messenger RNA, or mRNA, that encodes that protein. In this way, antisense drugs can be used to reduce the level of proteins that cause, or contribute to, the progression of various diseases. Because there are virtually no undruggable mRNA targets, we believe antisense technology may have broader potential than small molecule- and antibody-based technologies that target proteins. Furthermore, antisense technology has the potential to target a growing number of disease-related genes more directly and efficiently than other protein-directed modalities. We believe this technology represents an important advance in treating diseases.
 
The production of a protein starts with a process called transcription, where the instructions for making a protein are transcribed from a gene, or DNA, into mRNA. The cell's protein production process is called translation, and antisense drugs can be designed to interrupt this process by causing the destruction of the targeted mRNA and therefore preventing the production of a protein of interest. The graphic below further illustrates the impact of antisense drugs on the production of proteins via this mechanism of action:
  8
 

Ionis has made significant improvements in its antisense drug technology in recent years. These include improving the discovery screening processes, which resulted in second-generation drugs, or generation 2+ drugs, with better properties. In addition, Ionis observed lower incidences of injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms compared to Ionis' generation 2.0 drugs.
 
The unique properties of our antisense drugs provide several potential advantages over traditional drug modalities. These advantages include:
 
 
● | Precise specificity. Our antisense drugs are designed using Ionis' generation 2+ screening processes to target single mRNAs, which minimizes or eliminates the possibility of our drugs binding to unintended genetic targets that can cause unwanted side effects.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Favorable dosing properties. We believe our drugs have predictable safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties based on Ionis' experience with dosing over 6,000 people with antisense drugs to date. Further, our drugs have a relatively long half-life of two to four weeks, which enables volanesorsen to be dosed once weekly and other drugs in our pipeline, which incorporate Ionis' LICA technology, to potentially be dosed once monthly or less frequently. Upon dosing, our drugs distribute well throughout the body, eliminating the need for special formulations or delivery vehicles.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No anticipated drug-to-drug interactions. Because they are nucleic acid based, we believe our drugs can be used in combination with virtually any existing treatment modality without the risk of drug-to-drug interactions or susceptibility to traditional enzyme degradation or metabolism pathways.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Broad applications to multiple disease targets, multiple tissues and multiple mechanisms. There are virtually no "undruggable" targets with antisense technology.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Efficient discovery and early development. Because of the efficiency of antisense technology, drug discovery and early development costs and success rates compare favorably to small molecule or antibody drug discovery and development.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



LICA Technology
 
Ionis' LICA technology conjugates specific chemical structures or molecules to antisense drugs to increase the efficiency of drug uptake in a particular tissue. For drugs that target proteins primarily expressed in the liver, including the three drugs in our pipeline beyond volanesorsen, Ionis' design uses N acetyl galactosamine, or GalNAc, LICA that interact specifically with receptors present on the surface of important liver cells. Phase 1 studies of all three of Akcea's LICA drugs have shown that doses up to 30-fold lower than non-LICA drugs result in consistent and clinically meaningful target reductions and a favorable safety and tolerability profile. We believe the enhancements from LICA technology have the potential to allow for less frequent administration and significantly lower doses providing greater patient convenience as compared to non-LICA forms.
 
Lipid Biology
 
Lipids are a group of organic compounds that, together with carbohydrates and proteins, constitute the primary structural material of living cells. Lipids include fatty acids and cholesterol, as well as triglycerides, which are lipids that contain three fatty acid molecules and are a major source of energy. Triglycerides are made in the liver or in the intestine after a person eats foods containing fat.

Because lipids are relatively insoluble in water, they must be transported from one site in the body to another in the form of lipoproteins. Lipoproteins package the lipids in a soluble form and also contain special proteins, known as apolipoproteins, that help regulate the metabolism of the lipids and direct their sub-cellular delivery. Commonly recognized lipoproteins are LDL, which transports cholesterol made in the liver to other tissues and is associated with elevated CVD risk, and high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, which transports cholesterol from the body back to the liver. Another important lipoprotein is an aggressive form of LDL known as Lp(a). Lp(a) not only carries the risks of LDL, but also has attached a protein, known as apo(a), which carries highly inflammatory oxidized phospholipids. When levels of these lipoproteins are high, they can more aggressively accumulate in the walls of blood vessels, leading to cholesterol accumulation, plaque formation and inflammation. This cholesterol deposition and inflammation can profoundly damage the arteries and, if continued, cause CVD, which includes heart attacks, strokes and disease of the peripheral arteries in the legs. Lp(a) both accumulates in the artery with higher affinity and has a longer residence time than LDL, causing more thrombogenesis (process of formation of a blood clot) and atherosclerosis (buildup of a waxy plaque on the inside of blood vessels).
 
Triglycerides are also transported by lipoproteins known as triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, such as chylomicrons and VLDL. High levels of these lipoproteins can cause metabolic complications such as pancreatitis, insulin resistance and diabetes. When triglyceride levels are too high, remnants, which are cholesterol-containing breakdown products of the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, can also enter the artery wall and, in a similar manner as LDL, lead to atherosclerosis. Further, the release of excess fatty acids can promote insulin resistance, fatty liver, and diabetes.
 
Statistical Significance
 
In the description of our clinical trials below, n represents the number of patients in a particular group and p or p-values represent the probability that random chance caused the result (e.g., a p-value = 0.001 means that there is a 0.1% probability that the difference between the placebo group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance). A p-value ≤0.05 is a commonly used criterion for statistical significance, and may be supportive of a finding of efficacy by regulatory authorities. However, regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, do not rely on strict statistical significance thresholds as criteria for market approval and maintain the flexibility to evaluate the overall risks and benefits of a treatment.

Cardiometabolic disease, which includes cardiovascular diseases and metabolic diseases such as diabetes, is the number one cause of death globally. According to the AHA, CVD alone accounts for 17.3 million deaths per year globally, a number that the AHA expects to grow to more than 23.6 million by 2030. Further, the number of individuals with metabolic diseases, including diabetes, is also rising dramatically. According to a 2010 study published in Population Health Metrics, the number of people in the United States with diabetes is projected to grow from approximately 20 million in 2010 to between 37 million and 56 million by 2030. Cardiometabolic risk factors include metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity and insulin resistance.
 
Lipid risk factors driven by abnormalities in lipid molecules contribute to cardiometabolic diseases, with elevated LDL-C being the most widely recognized. Despite the availability of powerful drugs to lower LDL-C, many people remain at significant risk due to other lipid disorders that are not adequately addressed with current therapies. This treatment gap represents a significant commercial opportunity both in orphan and in broader diseases, with new therapies needed.

Volanesorsen
 
Overview
 
We have filed for marketing authorization for volanesorsen to treat patients with FCS in the U.S., EU and Canada. FCS is an orphan disease characterized by extremely elevated triglyceride levels and a high risk of life-threatening pancreatitis. Patients with FCS live with daily and chronic manifestations of their disease that negatively affect their lives, including severe, recurrent abdominal pain and cognitive impairment. Volanesorsen acts to reduce triglyceride levels by inhibiting the production of apoC-III, a protein that is a key regulator of triglyceride clearance. People who have low levels of apoC-III or reduced apoC-III function have lower levels of triglycerides and a lower incidence of CVD.
 
We believe volanesorsen has the potential to significantly improve the lives of patients with FCS. We demonstrated in Phase 2 studies that volanesorsen robustly reduced apoC-III and triglycerides in patients, including in FCS patients, and also had a beneficial impact on insulin sensitivity. Further, in a Phase 2 study, the triglyceride levels in all patients with FCS treated with volanesorsen were reduced to levels below 500 mg/dL, which is a commonly accepted level associated with reduced risk of pancreatitis. We published our findings from the Phase 2 studies with volanesorsen in two publications in the New England Journal of Medicine.

We filed our marketing applications in multiple jurisdictions based on positive data from volanesorsen's Phase 3 program to treat patients with FCS. The Phase 3 program consisted of two studies, the APPROACH study and the COMPASS study. The APPROACH study, a one-year randomized, placebo-controlled study in 66 patients with FCS (average incoming triglycerides of 2,209 mg/dL), achieved its primary endpoint of reduction in triglycerides at three months, with a 77% mean reduction in triglycerides (p<0.0001), which translated into a 1,712 mg/dL mean absolute triglyceride reduction in volanesorsen-treated patients (p<0.0001). In the study, we observed that more than 75% of treated patients achieved triglyceride levels below 750 mg/dL, the level at which chylomicron formation begins to become significant, and 50% of treated patients achieved triglyceride levels below 500 mg/dL, a commonly accepted threshold for pancreatitis risk. Each of these results was statistically significant compared to placebo-treated patients, none of whom achieved triglyceride levels below 500 mg/dL. In addition, in the APPROACH study, treatment with volanesorsen was associated with a statistically significant reduced rate of pancreatitis attacks in the group of patients who had a documented history of recurrent pancreatitis attacks in the five years prior to the study (p=0.02). Patients treated with volanesorsen who had reported abdominal pain before treatment in the study, also experienced reduced and less frequent pain than their placebo-treated counterparts, a difference that was more evident as the study progressed. The triglyceride lowering effects we observed were maintained throughout the 12-month study period. The COMPASS study, a six-month randomized placebo-controlled study in 113 patients with very high triglycerides (>500 mg/dL), also achieved its primary endpoint of reduction in triglycerides at three months, with a 71% mean reduction in triglycerides. In the COMPASS study, treatment with volanesorsen was associated with a statistically significant reduction in pancreatitis attacks (p=0.036). The data from the COMPASS and APPROACH studies is consistent with and supports the robust triglyceride lowering we observed in the Phase 2 program for volanesorsen.
 
The most common adverse event in the studies was injection site reactions, which were mostly mild. In addition, declines in platelet counts were observed in many patients and some patients discontinued the study because of platelet declines. These platelet declines were not clinically significant in most patients and were generally well managed with monitoring and dose adjustment. Some patients also discontinued participation in the APPROACH study due to other non-serious adverse events, including sweating and chills, severe fatigue, rash and injection site reaction. In the APPROACH study and the open label extension study, the potentially treatment-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, observed were serious platelet events (grade 4 thrombocytopenia). These events resolved without complication after cessation of dosing. Enhanced monitoring was implemented during the study to support early detection and management of these issues. Since implementation of the enhanced monitoring, serious platelet events have been infrequent. In the COMPASS study, the most common adverse event in the volanesorsen-treated group of patients was injection site reactions, which were mostly mild, and the potentially treatment-related SAE of serum sickness reaction where the patient fully recovered. There have been no deaths and no treatment-related cardiovascular events in any volanesorsen clinical study. We believe our greater involvement with physicians and patients, which will be a core focus of the education and support provided by our patient-centric commercial approach, should allow us to better maintain patients on volanesorsen therapy.
 
We have filed for marketing authorization in the U.S., EU and Canada for volanesorsen to treat patients with FCS based on what we believe is a favorable risk-benefit profile supported by data from both APPROACH and COMPASS. We are preparing to globally commercialize volanesorsen ourselves for FCS and, if approved, we will launch quickly thereafter in each geography.
 
Volanesorsen is also in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of FPL. The Phase 3 BROADEN study is currently enrolling patients with FPL. We plan to report data from this study in 2019. Patients with FPL have elevated triglyceride levels associated with a rare genetic disorder characterized by selective, progressive loss of body fat (adipose tissue) from various areas of the body. The FDA and EMA have granted orphan drug designation to volanesorsen for the treatment of patients with FCS. The EMA has granted orphan drug designation to volanesorsen for the treatment of patients with FPL.
 
Disease Background
 
Familial chylomicronemia syndrome
 
FCS is an inherited orphan disorder and includes type 1 hyperlipoproteinemia, Fredrickson type 1 hyperlipidemia and lipoprotein lipase, or LPL, deficiency. Patients with FCS lack the ability to produce enzymes to clear triglycerides, normally due to one or more loss-of-function mutations in genes related to triglyceride metabolism, which often results in triglyceride levels higher than 2,000 mg/dL—more than 10 times the normal level. As a result, patients with FCS may suffer from many health issues including severe, recurrent abdominal pain, fatigue and a high risk of life-threatening pancreatitis. In addition, they also suffer from daily conditions that can negatively impact their quality of life including neuropsychiatric symptoms such as memory loss, dementia, mild depression and cognitive impairment (described as brain fog and forgetfulness), as well as gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea and vomiting. There are no approved therapeutic options for patients with FCS. Standard triglyceride lowering agents, including niacin, fish oils and fibrates, are generally not effective in this patient population. Patients are required to adhere to a very strict, low-fat diet, which is extremely burdensome and difficult to maintain, and many patients still experience symptoms even if they are compliant with the diet. By inhibiting the production of apoC-III, volanesorsen is able to increase triglyceride clearance in FCS patients, reducing their triglyceride levels.

Familial Partial Lipodystrophy
 
People with FPL lack subcutaneous adipose tissue and have abnormal subcutaneous fat distribution. Because FPL patients are unable to store fat properly, they may have triglyceride levels higher than 1,000 mg/dL—more than five times the normal level. Additionally, because FPL patients cannot store excess triglycerides, their triglyceride levels may be extremely elevated after meals. These triglycerides deposit in organs other than normal fat tissue, known as ectopic fat. Ectopic fat accumulation may affect many organs, but primarily leads to health issues in the liver, pancreas and skeletal muscles. As a result, patients with FPL experience an increased incidence of potentially life-threatening pancreatitis, diabetes and extreme insulin resistance, as well as the accumulation of harmful fat in the liver, known as hepatic steatosis. Without enough fat tissue, an FPL patient's metabolic system, which regulates energy use, also falls out of balance. We believe that the robust triglyceride reduction and the improvements in glucose control and insulin sensitivity we observed in our Phase 2 program support development of volanesorsen for patients with FPL.
Burden of Disease
 
Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome
 
Due to the high levels of triglycerides in their blood, patients with FCS may suffer from many chronic health issues including severe, recurrent abdominal pain, fatigue, high risk of life-threatening pancreatitis and abnormal enlargement of the liver or spleen. When triglyceride levels are very high (greater than 750 mg/dL), they form chylomicrons, which are large particles that can block pancreatic ducts causing an inflammatory cascade that ultimately results in pancreatitis, which is when the organ begins to digest itself. The presence of excess chylomicrons results in blood that is milky-white in appearance due to the excess of these fat particles. Patients with FCS may also experience organ failure and pancreatic necrosis. Some of these debilitating conditions may also result in lengthy hospitalization stays, including time in the intensive care unit. In addition, they also suffer from daily conditions that can negatively impact their quality of life, including neuropsychiatric symptoms such as memory loss, dementia, mild depression and cognitive impairment (described as brain fog and forgetfulness), as well as gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea and vomiting. In addition, patients with FCS have to adhere to a very low-fat diet, which is extremely burdensome. Generally, patients try to consume no more than the equivalent of approximately one tablespoon of olive oil per day. As a result of these factors, patients with FCS are often unable to work, adding to the burden of the disease.
 
In order to quantify the burden of FCS on patients and the healthcare system, we, in conjunction with patients and clinicians, developed and conducted a global FCS patient survey called IN-FOCUS. We recruited approximately 170 patients, from multiple countries, to take this survey. We completed an interim analysis on the first 60 respondents which showed that pain, fatigue and chronic pancreatitis impact employment and productivity. Final analysis of the study was consistent with the interim analysis.  The final analysis has been submitted for publication.
 
Other key findings from the interim analysis were:
 
 
● | Age: The majority of respondents were between 20 and 40 years of age, with an average age of 36.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diagnosis: Respondents saw an average of five physicians (range: 1-30) before receiving a diagnosis of FCS.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Symptoms: All of the symptoms described below occurred daily to several times per week and were moderate to very severe in magnitude.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Physical symptoms: generalized abdominal pain, bloating, indigestion and lack of appetite as well as generalized weakness and fatigue.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Emotional symptoms: anxiety about their overall health due to FCS, constant uncertainty about having an attack of pain or acute pancreatitis at any time, embarrassment about always thinking about and planning for food and anxiety about eating food prepared by someone else.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 22% of patients reported feeling depressed, as compared to a 6.7% rate of depression diagnosis in the general adult U.S. population.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 33% of patients reported constant anxiety, fear or worry about having an attack of pain or acute pancreatitis at any time.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cognitive symptoms: difficulty concentrating, "brain fog" (i.e. lack of thought clarity), impaired judgment, forgetfulness and recent memory loss.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Acute Pancreatitis: Lifetime number of pancreatitis attacks ranged from 1-31+, with a mean of 12. Additionally, over their lifetimes, 40% of those hospitalized for acute pancreatitis were readmitted within 30 days of their discharge.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diet: The average fat intake of respondents was 20-21g/day. 87% of the respondents noted that managing their diet was extremely challenging.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Employment: Only 22% of patients reported full time employment and 20% were unemployed.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Absences: Time off from work due to FCS ranged from 0-61+ days with a mean of 30 days in the past 12 months, compared with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported average absence of four to five days per calendar year.

While all the complications of FCS cause patients to have a lower quality of life, pancreatitis is the most serious consequence of the disease. The mortality rate of acute pancreatitis ranges between six and eight percent. Some FCS patients have multiple episodes of acute pancreatitis in a year. Further, pancreatitis attacks generally become more frequent from the teenage years through patients' 30s and 40s. Patients are often admitted to the intensive care unit for further monitoring and hospitalization can last for multiple days. In severe cases, patients can have bleeding into the pancreas, serious tissue damage, infection and cyst formation, as well as damage to other vital organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. Further, even a single episode of acute pancreatitis can permanently damage the pancreas, potentially leading to pancreatic deficiency, which can cause digestive issues, oily stool and insulin-dependent diabetes. The persistent and often severe abdominal pain that FCS patients may experience may also be indicative of episodes of undiagnosed pancreatitis. There is no specific drug treatment for acute pancreatitis and typically physicians manage pancreatitis with intravenous fluids and pain medications in the hospital.

Acute pancreatitis caused by high triglycerides can result in more days in the hospital, with a risk of irreversible organ damage and premature death. For example, a 2015 study published by Nawaz et. al. in The American Journal of Gastroenterology demonstrated that acute pancreatitis caused by high triglycerides (triglycerides >1000 mg/dL) can have serious manifestations, and can be substantially worse than pancreatitis from other causes (triglycerides <150 mg/dL), leading to longer median hospital stays, increased need for intensive care, a higher rate of pancreatic necrosis, more frequent persistent (i.e. >48 hr.) organ failure and higher rates of mortality, as illustrated in the figure below:

Familial Partial Lipodystrophy
 
FPL is a rare lipid disorder characterized by abnormal fat distribution across the body and a range of metabolic abnormalities, including severe insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis and, in affected women, features of hyperandrogenism. People with FPL often present with polycystic ovarian syndrome or unusually insulin-resistant diabetes and are at increased risk of acute pancreatitis in addition to long-term, progressive consequences including premature cardiovascular disease and liver disease, resulting in cirrhosis. They are unable to store fat or triglycerides in normal fat stores, so excess triglycerides are stored in the liver and muscle and accumulate at high levels in the bloodstream. In order to quantify the burden of FPL on patients and the healthcare system, we, in conjunction with patients and clinicians, developed and are currently conducting a global FPL patient survey called REVEAL.
Volanesorsen Clinical Development
 
Phase 2 studies
 
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, Phase 2 study to evaluate volanesorsen in both untreated patients with fasting triglyceride levels between 350 mg/dL and 2,000 mg/dL (volanesorsen monotherapy cohort) and in patients receiving stable fibrate therapy who had fasting triglyceride levels between 225 mg/dL and 2,000 mg/dL (volanesorsen—fibrate cohort). We randomly assigned eligible patients to receive either volanesorsen, at doses ranging from 100 to 300 mg, or placebo, once weekly for 13 weeks. The primary endpoint was percent change in apoC-III level from baseline. We designed the secondary endpoints to evaluate the effects of volanesorsen on additional lipid parameters, including triglyceride, LDL and HDL levels. We also investigated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of volanesorsen in these patients. We published the results of this study, which was the first to support the role of apoC-III as a key regulator of triglyceride metabolism in a wide variety of patients with hypertriglyceridemia, in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2015.
 
A total of 57 patients were treated in the volanesorsen monotherapy cohort (41 received volanesorsen and 16 received placebo), and 28 patients were treated in the volanesorsen—fibrate cohort (20 received volanesorsen and 8 received placebo). The mean baseline triglyceride levels in the two cohorts were 581 mg/dL and 376 mg/dL, respectively. Treatment with volanesorsen resulted in dose-dependent, highly consistent and prolonged decreases in plasma apoC-III and in triglyceride levels when clinicians administered the drug as a single agent and as an add-on to fibrates.

The tables below illustrate the triglyceride changes in aggregate across the study cohorts:

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



As part of our Phase 2 study, we included an open label cohort using a 300 mg dose of volanesorsen in three FCS patients. At baseline, apoC-III levels were elevated to two to three times normal levels in all three patients. The patients' apoC-III levels fell dramatically during the first two weeks of treatment with volanesorsen with reductions in apoC-III from baseline ranging from approximately 70% to 90%. Baseline triglyceride levels in the three patients varied, but were all above 1,000 mg/dL, and fell rapidly during the first two weeks of treatment in parallel with decreases in apoC-III, with triglyceride levels in all patients dropping below 500 mg/dL during the study. Triglyceride levels at day 85, the time of the primary analysis, were 56% to 86% lower than at baseline, with absolute reductions of 790 mg/dL to 1,796 mg/dL. The triglyceride levels of patients two and three, who had baseline triglyceride levels greater than 2,000 mg/dL, dropped to as low as 251 mg/dL and 234 mg/dL, respectively, during the treatment period. After cessation of dosing on day 85, triglycerides slowly began to return to pre-treatment levels.

The figures below further illustrate these results:
 
Fasting apoC-III levels in FCS patients treated with 300 mg of volanesorsen
 

Fasting triglyceride levels in FCS patients treated with 300 mg of volanesorsen
 

We published the results of the FCS patient cohort in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2014 because they revealed for the first time that apoC-III raised triglycerides by two different pathways, one dependent on LPL and one independent of LPL. It was previously thought that apoC-III raised triglycerides primarily by inhibiting LPL, which breaks down triglycerides in the blood. Patients with FCS lack LPL activity and yet inhibiting apoC-III with volanesorsen nevertheless dramatically lowered triglyceride levels.
 
Additionally, in a separate Phase 2 clinical study, patients with high triglycerides and type 2 diabetes treated with volanesorsen achieved significant reductions in apoC-III and triglyceride levels and exhibited improvements in measures of glucose control and insulin sensitivity. We observed a 57% improvement in insulin sensitivity in patients treated with volanesorsen compared to patients receiving placebo, as measured by a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, which assesses how well the body uses insulin to remove sugar, in the form of glucose, from the blood and maintain normal blood sugar levels.

No safety concerns were identified in our Phase 2 study that included the monotherapy group, the volanesorsen-fibrate group and the FCS patient group. Injection site reactions occurred across all three groups. These reactions were typically mild redness or pain, did not get worse or lead to other issues and resolved spontaneously. Other safety assessments, including vital signs, electrocardiographic findings and urinalysis results, were clinically unremarkable. In addition, there was no clinical or laboratory evidence of drug-to-drug interactions in patients receiving concomitant medications, including statins, fibrates and glucose-lowering agents.
 
A similar safety profile was seen in the study involving patients with high triglycerides and type 2 diabetes. No patients treated in this study with volanesorsen discontinued treatment with the study drug because of adverse events. Across the Phase 2 studies, a potentially treatment-related SAE was serum sickness-like reaction where the patient fully recovered.
 
Phase 3 program and regulatory approach
 
Volanesorsen has completed a Phase 3 clinical program for the treatment of FCS and is currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of FPL. The Phase 3 FCS program includes the APPROACH and COMPASS studies. The Phase 3 FPL program includes these same two studies, as well as the BROADEN study.
 
APPROACH Study
 
APPROACH is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 300 mg of volanesorsen administered by a subcutaneous injection in patients with FCS. Patients in the study were treated once a week for a period of one year. The primary endpoint in this study was percent change, relative to baseline, in fasting triglycerides at three months. In addition, we designed the secondary endpoints to allow us to further evaluate changes in triglycerides, changes in frequency and severity of abdominal pain and pancreatitis, and levels of hepatosplenomegaly, which is abnormal swelling of the spleen and liver. The patients were randomized 1:1, receiving either volanesorsen or placebo. After one year of dosing, patients were eligible to roll over into an open label extension study, in which all patients receive volanesorsen. APPROACH closed enrollment in December 2015 with a total of 66 patients. We dosed the last patient with his/her last dose in the study in January 2017. We reported top-line data from this study in March 2017.
 
The average incoming triglyceride level of patients in the study was 2,209 mg/dL. Patients treated with volanesorsen experienced clinically meaningful benefits in triglyceride levels, consistent with the Phase 2 experience described above as well as additional disease benefits, as summarized below. For the primary endpoint of the study, volanesorsen-treated patients (n=33) achieved a statistically significant (p<0.0001) mean reduction in triglycerides of 77% from baseline after three months of treatment, compared to a mean increase of 18% in placebo-treated patients (n=33). This represented a mean absolute reduction of 1,712 mg/dL in treated patients.
 
 
● | The treatment effect was maintained over the 52-week treatment period.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 50% of the treated patients achieved triglyceride levels less than 500 mg/dL after three months of treatment, a commonly accepted threshold for pancreatitis risk. By comparison, none of the placebo-treated patients achieved this level at the analysis time points (p<0.003). Additionally, 76.7% of the treated patients, as compared to 9.7% of the placebo-treated patients (p=0.0001), achieved triglyceride levels less than 750 mg/dL after three months of treatment, a level above which chylomicron formation begins.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A statistically significant reduction in abdominal pain was observed in volanesorsen-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients (p=0.02) who reported abdominal pain before treatment in the study.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Volanesorsen-treated patients who had a documented history of recurrent pancreatitis attacks in the five years prior to the study experienced no attacks during the 52-week treatment period (p=0.02) as compared to the placebo. Further details are shown in the figure below:

p-value | p = 0.02

 
The most common adverse event in the volanesorsen-treated group of patients was injection site reactions, which were mostly mild. In addition, declines in platelet counts were observed in many patients and some patients discontinued the study because of platelet declines. These platelet declines were not clinically significant in most patients and were generally well managed with monitoring and dose adjustment. Some patients also discontinued participation in the APPROACH study due to other non-serious adverse events, including sweating and chills, severe fatigue, rash and injection site reaction. In the APPROACH and the open label extension studies, the potentially treatment-related SAEs observed were serious platelet events (grade 4 thrombocytopenia). These events resolved without complication after cessation of dosing. Enhanced monitoring was implemented during the study to support early detection and management of these issues. Since implementation of the enhanced monitoring, serious platelet events have been infrequent. Platelet monitoring is occurring once weekly in our open label extension study and is planned to occur once every other week in the commercial setting for all patients on volanesorsen. In the study, there were no treatment-related liver adverse events, including no increases in liver fat. There were no treatment-related renal adverse events. There were no deaths and no treatment-related cardiovascular events in the study. We believe our greater involvement with physicians and patients, which will be a core focus of the education and support provided by our patient-centric commercial approach, should allow us to better maintain patients on volanesorsen therapy.

COMPASS Study
 
COMPASS is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 300 mg of volanesorsen administered by subcutaneous injection in patients with elevated triglyceride levels (greater than 500 mg/dL). Patients in the study were dosed once a week for a period of six months. The primary endpoint is percent change, relative to baseline, in fasting triglycerides at week 13. We designed the secondary endpoints to allow us to further evaluate changes in triglycerides, incidence of pancreatitis and parameters associated with insulin resistance and diabetes. The patients were randomized 2:1, receiving either volanesorsen or placebo. We completed enrollment in this study in May 2016 with 113 patients dosed. We dosed the last patient with his/her last dose in the study in November 2016.
 
In December 2016, we announced that the COMPASS study met its primary endpoint. The average incoming triglyceride level of patients in the study was 1,261 mg/dL. Patients treated with volanesorsen experienced clinically meaningful benefits in triglyceride levels, consistent with the Phase 2 experience described above, and as summarized below:
 
 
● | For the primary endpoint of the study, volanesorsen-treated patients (n=75) achieved a statistically significant (p<0.0001) mean reduction in triglycerides of 71% from baseline after 13 weeks of treatment, compared with a mean reduction of 0.9% in placebo-treated patients (n=38). This represented a mean absolute reduction of 869 mg/dL in treated patients. The treatment effect observed was maintained through the end of the 26-week treatment period.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In a subset of seven patients with FCS, whose average incoming triglyceride level was 2,280 mg/dL, volanesorsen-treated patients (n=5) achieved a mean reduction in triglycerides of 73% from baseline after 13 weeks of treatment, compared with a mean increase of 70% in placebo-treated patients (n=2). This represented a mean absolute reduction of 1,511 mg/dL in treated patients. The treatment effect observed was maintained through the end of the 26-week treatment period. None of the reductions in triglyceride levels in the FCS group were statistically significant.

● | In addition, 82% of patients treated with volanesorsen, including three of the volanesorsen-treated FCS patients, achieved triglyceride levels less than 500 mg/dL, a commonly accepted threshold for pancreatitis risk, after 13 weeks of treatment, compared to 14% of placebo-treated patients (p<0.0001).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Further, we observed a statistically significant reduction in pancreatitis events with volanesorsen treatment compared to placebo (p=0.036), with five pancreatitis events in the placebo-treated cohort and no pancreatitis events in the volanesorsen-treated cohort during the treatment period.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The most common adverse event in the volanesorsen-treated group of patients was injection site reactions, which were mostly mild. In this study, patients discontinued treatment due to injection site reactions and other adverse events. None of the FCS patients in the study discontinued. There were no deaths or cardiovascular events in the study. In addition, there were no serious platelet events in the study. Serum sickness was reported as a potentially related serious adverse event in the volanesorsen arm. The patient fully recovered.
 
BROADEN Study
 
BROADEN is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 300 mg of volanesorsen administered by a subcutaneous injection in patients with FPL. Patients in the study will be dosed once weekly for a period of one year. The primary endpoint is the percent change, relative to baseline, in fasting triglycerides at week 13. We designed the secondary endpoints to allow us to further evaluate changes in triglycerides, rates of pancreatitis, parameters associated with insulin resistance and diabetes, and changes in liver fat. The patients are randomized 1:1, receiving either volanesorsen or placebo. After one year of dosing, patients are eligible to roll over into an open label extension period in which all patients will receive volanesorsen. We plan to report results from the BROADEN study in 2019.
 
Volanesorsen Clinical Data Summary
 
In both APPROACH and COMPASS, we saw reductions in rates of pancreatitis, one of the most important and impactful symptoms of FCS, in patients treated with volanesorsen. The table below describes the number of pancreatitis attacks in each study and also shows the combined rate of pancreatitis across both studies. While the reduction in the total number of pancreatitis attacks in APPROACH was not statistically significant due to the small sample size, both COMPASS (p=0.036) and the combined data (p=0.019) showed statistically significant reductions in pancreatitis attacks.

Incidence of Pancreatitis | Placebo | Volanesorsen | 
--------------------------+---------+--------------+------------
APPROACH (n) | 33 | 33 | 
# of pancreatitis events | 4 | 1 | 
COMPASSS (n) | 38 | 75 | 
# of pancreatitis events | 5 | 0 | (p = 0.036)
COMPASS + APPROACH (n) | 71 | 108 | 
# of pancreatitis events | 9 | 1 | (p = 0.019)

 
Based on what we believe is a favorable risk-benefit profile, supported by data from both APPROACH and COMPASS, we filed for marketing authorization in the U.S., Canada and EU in the third quarter of 2017 for volanesorsen to treat patients with FCS. We plan to file marketing applications to treat patients with FCS in regions outside of the U.S., Canada and EU as soon as practical starting in 2018.

Volanesorsen Commercial Opportunity
 
If we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval to commercialize volanesorsen to treat patients with FCS and FPL on our anticipated timeline, we believe volanesorsen could be the only drug on the market in the United States specifically approved for these indications. We also believe volanesorsen could be the only specifically approved drug for these indications on the market in Europe. We believe that volanesorsen could, over time, be used in a significant proportion of FCS and FPL patients, given that there are no currently approved, effective treatments for FCS or FPL.
 
We estimate there are 3,000 to 5,000 FCS patients in treatable markets and an additional 3,000 to 5,000 FPL patients globally. As with many orphan diseases, however, patients with FCS and FPL are underdiagnosed and, as a result, we believe the population sizes may be underestimated. Based on our work so far, we believe that the number of patients in treatable markets is closer to the higher end of the range for FCS. We have underway an epidemiology project to gain insight into the FCS population. In addition, we believe that our efforts to raise awareness of these diseases and improve diagnosis with simplified clinical diagnosis criteria, plus the availability of a drug, could significantly improve identification of patients and result in larger identified patient populations. We are building a database of identified patients by working with physicians and patient organizations and through improved diagnosis and referrals. In order to protect patient confidentiality, we do not include patient-specific information in the database. We add blinded patient information to our database through communication with physicians, patient organizations and other tools, such as surveys conducted in partnership with medical societies and electronic medical record database searches. We plan to use our database to help us engage with physicians who may have patients who could potentially benefit from our drugs.
 
Due to the specialized nature of managing FCS and FPL, there are a limited number of treating physicians.

AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx
 
Overview
 
We are developing AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx for patients who are at significant risk of CVD because of their elevated levels of Lp(a). AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx inhibits the production of the apo(a) protein, thereby reducing Lp(a). Lp(a) is a very atherogenic and thrombogenic form of LDL. Elevated Lp(a) is recognized as an independent, genetic cause of coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke and peripheral arterial disease. Inhibiting the production of apo(a) in the liver reduces the level of Lp(a) in blood, potentially slowing down or reversing cardiovascular disease in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia(a), a condition in which individuals have levels of Lp(a) greater than 60 mg/dL. Lp(a) is difficult to inhibit using other technologies, such as small molecules and antibodies; there are multiple genetically determined forms of the apo(a) molecule and creating a small molecule or antibody that can interact with multiple targets is difficult. We believe antisense technology is particularly well suited to address hyperlipoproteinemia(a) because it specifically targets the RNA that codes for all forms of the apo(a) molecule. As a result, it can stop the production of all the forms of the protein. Furthermore, we believe addressing elevated Lp(a) is the next important horizon in lipid-focused treatment and, through our collaboration with Novartis, we plan to develop AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx to treat patients with established cardiovascular disease in whom hyperlipoproteinemia(a) likely plays a causal role.
 
We have completed a Phase 1/2 study with AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia(a) and we reported the results at the AHA meeting in November 2015. In this clinical study, we observed significant and sustained reductions in Lp(a) of up to 97% with a mean reduction of 79% after only a single, small volume dose of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. With multiple doses of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, we observed even greater reductions of Lp(a) of up to 99% with a mean reduction of 92%. Based on these results, we started a Phase 2b dose-ranging study of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia(a) and established CVD. We completed enrollment in this study in January 2018 and expect to report data from this study in the second half of 2018. We have initiated a strategic collaboration with Novartis for this drug. See "—Our Strategic Collaboration with Novartis" for additional information.
 
Disease Background
 
Despite the management of LDL-C with statins and other therapies, the incidence of CVD continues to rise dramatically. Lipid disorders are a cause of this continuing rise. Hyperlipoproteinemia(a), which is present in approximately 20% of the general population, causes CVD.
  20
 

Currently, there is no effective drug therapy to specifically and robustly lower elevated levels of Lp(a). Lp(a) levels are determined at birth and, therefore, lifestyle modification, including diet and exercise, do not impact Lp(a) levels. Statins do not have significant effects on Lp(a) levels. Further, a new class of drugs that lower LDL-C and modestly lower Lp(a) levels, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, inactivate a protein in the plasma that regulates the number of LDL receptors on the liver cell surface, thereby capturing and removing additional LDL particles from the blood. While PCSK9 inhibitors reduce Lp(a) by approximately 25%, we believe this level of reduction is unlikely to materially reduce the risk of cardiovascular events related to hyperlipoproteinemia(a). The only currently known effective way to significantly reduce plasma Lp(a) is to physically remove the particles from blood through a process called apheresis. In this process, the patient's blood is filtered through a machine where the LDL-C and Lp(a) particles are removed and the blood is returned to the patient's body. Since 2010, apheresis has been an approved therapy in Germany to treat patients with hyperlipoproteinemia(a), but it is expensive, time consuming and only performed by a small number of centers worldwide. Lp(a) apheresis has been shown to lower the rate of cardiovascular events, providing support that lowering Lp(a) can provide therapeutic benefit.
 
A number of expert groups, including the National Institutes for Health, European Society of Cardiology and the National Lipid Association, and publications have stated that Lp(a) is an independent cause of cardiovascular risk. The authors of three such publications evaluated data from over 180,000 participants and used statistical and genetic approaches to evaluate the correlation between Lp(a) levels and cardiovascular risk. The specific techniques the authors used were epidemiological/meta-analyses, Mendelian randomization and genome wide associations. In each technique used, the authors demonstrated a clear relationship between elevated levels of Lp(a) and increased cardiovascular risk.
 
The graphics below further illustrate these correlations:
 

AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx Clinical Development
 
Phase 1/2a studies
 
We conducted a Phase 1/2a single and multiple ascending dose study with AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in 58 people with elevated levels of Lp(a). Individuals treated with AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx achieved significant dose-dependent reductions in Lp(a), with the largest reductions at day 30. The results of this study were published in the Lancet in 2016. In the single dose portion of the study, we investigated five dose levels of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx ranging from 10 mg to 120 mg, compared to placebo.
 
The results from this portion of the study are illustrated in the tables below:
 
Single Dose; Randomized 3:1
 
Dose | 10mg | 20mg | 40mg | 80mg | 120mg | placebo
----------------------------------------+------+------+------+------+-------+--------
Number of people | 3 | 3 | 3 | 6 | 6 | 7 
Mean change from baseline at day 30 (%) | -26% | -33% | -44% | -79% | -85% | 3% 

 
In the multiple ascending dose portion of the study, we investigated three dose levels of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, compared to placebo. At each dose level, people received three doses on alternate days during the first week and then a single dose once a week for the next three weeks.
 
The results from this portion of the study are illustrated in the tables below:
 
Multiple Ascending Dose; Randomized 4:1
 
Dose | 10mg | 20mg | 40mg | placebo
----------------------------------------+------+------+------+--------
Number of people | 8 | 8 | 8 | 6 
Mean change from baseline at day 30 (%) | -66% | -80% | -92% | -9% 

 
 21
 

The graphic below shows the mean percent change in Lp(a) in the multiple ascending dose groups:
 

 
* | The asterisks represent p-values as follows: *p<0.05; **p≤0.01; ***p≤0.001. Arrows indicate dosing at days 1, 3, 5, 8, 15, and 22. P-values are for the primary efficacy endpoint at day 36 as determined by the Exact Wilcoxon Rank Sum comparing AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx versus placebo.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx was generally safe and well tolerated in the study, which supported continued development. There were no injection site reactions or flu-like symptoms reported. Additionally, in the multiple-dose cohorts, there were no clinically relevant changes in electrocardiograms or vital signs, or in safety laboratory parameters including liver and kidney markers, hematology (including platelet count), coagulation (including activated partial thromboplastin time), inflammation (high sensitivity C Reactive Protein), complement and urinalysis.
 
Phase 2b study
 
We are conducting a Phase 2b study of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia(a) and established CVD. The goal of the study is to determine the dose level and frequency for use in a future cardiovascular outcome study. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx administered by a subcutaneous injection. Patients in the study will be dosed for a period of six months, and a portion of the patients will continue for up to one year. We are testing multiple different dosing levels and regimens. The primary endpoint is the percent change in plasma Lp(a) from baseline at six months. The secondary endpoints will be changes in LDL-C, responder analyses, and other key lipid parameters. Further, we are evaluating safety and pharmacokinetics of the different doses. We enrolled over 270 patients, randomized 5:1, to receive AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx or a matched quantity of placebo. We completed enrollment into the study in January 2018 and plan to report topline data in the second half of 2018.
 
 22
 

AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx Commercial Opportunity
 
Elevated levels of Lp(a) are associated with increased cardiovascular risk and lowering Lp(a) may reduce the risk. We estimate the eligible population to be 8.5 to 11 million people globally. We believe that positive results from a large cardiovascular outcome study will be required to support marketing authorization for the treatment of these patients. If Novartis exercises its option, it would conduct, at its expense, such a study pursuant to our strategic collaboration and, if approved, to commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx for these patients.
 
AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx
 
Overview
 
We are developing AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx to treat multiple lipid disorders. Studies have shown that elevated levels of the ANGPTL3 protein are associated with an increased risk of premature heart attacks, increased arterial wall thickness and multiple metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance. In contrast, people with lower levels of ANGPTL3 have lower LDL-C and triglyceride levels and thus lower risk of heart attacks and multiple metabolic disorders. In preclinical studies, an analog of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx inhibited the production of the ANGPTL3 protein in the liver, inhibiting liver fat accumulation and lowering blood levels of triglycerides, LDL-C and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or VLDL-C. In addition, our preclinical data and initial Phase 1 data suggest that inhibiting the production of ANGPTL3 could improve other lipid parameters, including triglyceride levels and total cholesterol.
 
We conducted a Phase 1/2 program for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in people with elevated triglycerides. We reported results for the initial cohort from this study at the AHA meeting in November 2016. We observed that the people with elevated triglycerides achieved dose-dependent, statistically significant mean reductions in ANGPTL3 of up to 83%. Treatment with AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx was also associated with statistically significant mean reductions in triglycerides of up to 66%, in LDL-C of up to 35% and in total cholesterol of up to 36%. In this study, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx was reported to be well tolerated. The most common adverse events in the AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx treated group of patients were mild headaches and dizziness that were approximately equal to the rate observed in the placebo group. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we initiated a study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with NAFLD with metabolic complications which include hypertriglyceridemia, type 2 diabetes or NASH. We expect data from this study in 2019. Further, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we also initiated a study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with rare hyperlipidemias, including patients with FCS, FPL and HoFH. We plan to report data from this program in 2018. We may consider developing AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx for additional indications including other rare hyperlipidemias and lipodystrophies. If we find that AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx can effectively lower triglyceride levels through a different mechanism of action from volanesorsen, it may represent an opportunity to expand our FCS franchise.
 
Disease Background
 
Fatty liver disease
 
While some fat in the liver is normal, a significant percentage of individuals have elevated levels of liver fat. Individuals with excessive fat accumulation in the liver also have elevated risk of developing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and CVD. These risks are further elevated in patients with hyperlipidemia, especially those with elevated triglyceride levels. The most common form of fatty liver disease is NAFLD, which is associated with obesity-related disorders even in patients who drink little or no alcohol, and is characterized by the gradual accumulation of fat in the liver, or steatosis. One of the key causes of this condition is the Western diet, which is rich in processed foods with high fat and sugar content. In the early stages of NAFLD, patients typically experience steatosis that is slow progressing. Over time, a subset of these patients progresses to steatohepatitis, a more severe and progressive form of NAFLD characterized by chronic inflammation and liver-cell damage, called NASH. Over time, the chronic inflammation caused by NASH can lead to the formation of scar tissue in the liver, known as fibrosis. As scar tissue gradually replaces healthy liver tissue, blood flow is restricted, which can lead to the loss of normal liver function, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, liver cancer and ultimately liver failure. Currently, there are no approved treatments specifically for NAFLD or NASH. If the disease ultimately progresses beyond NASH, the only alternative is a liver transplant.
Rare Hyperlipidemias
 
Rare hyperlipidemias are genetic diseases characterized by high levels of lipids or lipoproteins in the blood. Function or levels of various lipid clearing enzymes, like LPL, LDL receptor and hepatic lipase, are decreased in patients with rare hyperlipidemias. These patients may also have a reduced ability to clear other lipids, including LDL, leading to very high lipid levels. Examples of diseases in this category include FCS and familial hypercholesterolemia. Despite existing and emerging therapies, there remains an unmet need to reduce multiple lipid parameters in these patients, including LDL and triglycerides.
 
 23
 

Lipodystrophies
 
Congenital and acquired forms of lipodystrophy are diseases characterized by abnormal or degenerative conditions of the body's adipose tissue. Patients with various forms of lipodystrophy may have difficulties in normal processing of lipids resulting in high LDL-C, triglycerides and fatty liver disease.
 
AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx Clinical Development
 
Preclinical and other related studies
 
Our preclinical data suggest that reducing ANGPTL3 could improve lipid parameters, including LDL-C, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. In a mouse model of increased liver fat, we observed that treatment with an analog of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx reduced liver fat concentrations by more than 50%.
 
Further, in a Phase 1 study that Ionis conducted with a non-LICA version of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, healthy volunteers experienced significant reductions of up to 93% in ANGPTL3, up to 63% in triglycerides and up to 46% in total cholesterol.
 
Phase 1/2 program
 
We conducted a placebo-controlled, dose escalation Phase 1/2 program to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx administered by a subcutaneous injection to people with elevated triglycerides. We evaluated single doses of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx at 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg and 120 mg and randomized healthy people with elevated triglycerides 3:1, active to placebo, where three participants received AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx and one participant received placebo. The multiple dose cohorts used lower doses with eight participants in each cohort. We reported initial results for the initial group of people with elevated triglycerides from this study at the AHA meeting in November 2016 and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in June 2017.
 
People who received multiple doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, or 60 mg of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx achieved dose-dependent, statistically significant mean reductions at Day 37 in ANGPTL3 of up to 83% (p ≤0.001). These subjects also experienced statistically significant mean reductions in triglycerides of up to 66% (p ≤0.001), in LDL-C of up to 35% (p ≤0.001) and in total cholesterol of up to 36% (p ≤0.001). In this study, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx was reported to be well tolerated. The most common adverse events in the AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx treated group of patients were mild headaches and dizziness that were approximately equal to the rate observed in the placebo group. There were no discontinuations due to adverse events and no platelet declines. The graphic below further summarizes these results.
 

 24
 

Phase 2 studies
 
In the second half of 2017, we began a study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with NAFLD with metabolic complications which include hypertriglyceridemia, type 2 diabetes or NASH. The goal of the study is to evaluate dose levels, frequencies and markers of liver fat. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx administered by a subcutaneous injection. The study is designed to dose patients over a period of at least six months. We are testing multiple doses and plan to evaluate safety and efficacy to support dose selection in future trials. The primary endpoint is the change in serum triglyceride levels at six months. We are also evaluating changes in key lipid parameters including LDL-C, as well as measures of liver fat, markers of liver inflammation and fibrosis and other metabolic parameters. We plan to enroll approximately 144 patients in the study. We plan to report data from this study in 2019.
 
We are also conducting exploratory studies of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in patients with three different rare hyperlipidemias, including patients with FCS, FPL and HoFH. The primary goal of these studies is to evaluate the ability of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx to lower triglyceride levels, LDL levels and/or other important lipid markers in patients with rare hyperlipidemias, and markers of insulin sensitivity and liver fat in FPL. We plan to test multiple doses and expect to evaluate safety and efficacy to support dose selection in future trials. We plan to report data from this program in 2018. If we demonstrate that we can successfully lower key lipid parameters, reduce liver fat, insulin sensitivity and body fat composition in these patients, we plan to begin the initiation process of our Phase 3 study in rare hyperlipidemias in the second half of 2018.
 
AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx Commercial Opportunity
 
NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide and more than 75 million patients are affected in the United States alone. Approximately 30% of patients with NAFLD will eventually progress to NASH. In the United States, the most recent epidemiological studies show that approximately 3% to 5% of the general population has NASH. We believe there are a comparable number of patients in Europe and the rest of the world. While there are a number of treatments currently in development for the treatment of NAFLD and NASH, none are currently approved and we believe there will continue to be a significant unmet medical need in this population.
 
Rare hyperlipidemia contains multiple diseases, including FCS and familial hypercholesterolemia. We believe that these populations are all orphan sized.
 
There are several types of lipodystrophies, congenital generalized, acquired generalized, familial partial, acquired partial, mandibuloacral dysplasia associated, and HIV associated. We believe these populations are all orphan sized.
 
AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx
 
Overview
 
We are developing AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx to inhibit the production of apoC-III, the same protein inhibited by volanesorsen, for the broad population of patients who have cardiometabolic disease due to their elevated triglyceride levels. ApoC-III impacts triglyceride levels and may also increase inflammatory processes. This combination of effects makes apoC-III a promising target for patients with LDL-C already controlled on statin therapy, but for whom triglycerides remain poorly controlled. We believe that the enhancements offered by Ionis' LICA technology can provide greater patient convenience by allowing for significantly lower doses and less frequent administration, compared to volanesorsen. We conducted a Phase 1/2 study of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in people with elevated triglycerides and reported results from this study in the fourth quarter of 2017. We initiated a Phase 2b dose-ranging study of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and established CVD in the first quarter of 2018 and plan to report data from this study in 2019. At the completion of Phase 2 development, Novartis has an option to license the drug. As part of our Novartis collaboration, we intend to complete the Phase 2 program required to define the appropriate dose and regimen to support a planned cardiovascular outcome study. If Novartis exercises its option to license AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, it would pay us $150.0 million, of which $75.0 million would go to Ionis. If exercised, Novartis plans to conduct and pay for a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study in high-risk patients and, if approved, to commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx worldwide. We plan to co-commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx with Novartis in selected markets, under terms and conditions that we plan to negotiate with Novartis in the future, through the specialized sales force we are building to commercialize volanesorsen. We believe Novartis brings significant resources and expertise to the collaboration that can accelerate our ability to deliver this potential therapy to patients at significant cardiovascular risk due to their elevated triglyceride levels.

Disease Background
 
ApoC-III is an important emerging target linking hypertriglyceridemia with CVD. Several studies have found that apoC-III levels are an independent risk factor for CVD. Further, its presence on lipoproteins may increase their atherogenicity. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that out of a sample of over 100,000 people, individuals with an apoC-III gene loss of function mutation had a reduced risk of clinical coronary heart disease. Each decrease of 1 mg/dL in plasma levels of apoC-III was associated with a 4% decrease in the risk of incident coronary heart disease. Triglycerides may also play a role in cardiovascular risk. As shown in the figure below, in two separate studies encompassing nearly 20,000 patients, as triglyceride levels increased, so did the risk of a cardiovascular event. In summary, apoC-III impacts triglyceride levels and may also increase inflammatory processes, and this combination of effects makes apoC-III a promising target for reducing the residual CVD risk in patients already on statin therapy, but for whom triglycerides are poorly controlled.
 

AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx Clinical Development
 
Phase 1/2 program
 
We conducted a placebo-controlled, dose escalation Phase 1/2 program to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx administered by a subcutaneous injection to people with elevated triglycerides. We evaluated single doses of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx at 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg and 120 mg and randomized healthy people with elevated triglycerides 3:1, active to placebo, where three participants received AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and one participant received placebo. The multiple dose cohorts used lower doses with eight participants in each cohort. We reported initial results for the initial group of people with elevated triglycerides from this study in late 2017.
 
People who received multiple doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, or 60 mg of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx achieved dose-dependent, statistically significant mean reductions at Day 37 in apoCIII of up to 84% (p ≤ 0.001) after six weeks of treatment. These subjects also experienced statistically significant mean dose-dependent reductions in triglycerides of up to 71% (p ≤0.001). Significant dose-dependent reductions of up to 30% in apolipoprotein B, or apoB, and increases of up to 100% in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or HDL-C, were also observed. Both decreased levels of apoB and increased levels of HDL-C are associated with decreased cardiovascular risk. AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx was well tolerated in the study. We saw no platelet reductions, including among patients who had four monthly doses, and no adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were observed.

Phase 2 studies
 
In the first quarter of 2018, we began a study of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and established CVD. The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase 2b study of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in approximately 100 patients with hypertriglyceridemia and established CVD. The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx and assess different doses and dosing regimens for the reduction of serum of triglyceride levels to support dose selection in future trials. We anticipate reporting top-line data from this study in 2019.
 
We have initiated a strategic collaboration with Novartis for this drug. See "Our Strategic Collaboration with Novartis" for additional information.
 
AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx Commercial Opportunity
 
ApoC-III levels and elevated triglycerides have been linked to increased cardiovascular risk and lowering apoC-III and triglycerides may reduce this risk. We estimate the eligible population to be 8.5 to 14.5 million people globally. We believe that positive results from a large cardiovascular outcome study will be required to support marketing authorization for the treatment of these patients. If Novartis exercises its option, it plans to conduct, at its expense, such a study pursuant to our strategic collaboration to conduct this study and to commercialize AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx for these patients.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our goal is to become the premier company offering treatments for previously inadequately treated lipid disorders. We are assembling the global infrastructure to develop the drugs in our pipeline and to commercialize them with a focus on lipid specialists, specialized endocrinologists and pancreatologists as our primary call points. We are also creating the specialized support required to potentially address other rare disease patient populations. We are building a small, highly focused salesforce to support the commercialization of volanesorsen, if approved, which would serve as the foundation of our sales, marketing and patient support efforts for all of the drugs in our pipeline, including our co-commercialization activities with Novartis for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, if and when approved under terms and conditions that we plan to negotiate with Novartis in the future.
 
Global Commercialization Infrastructure
 
We plan to commercialize volanesorsen ourselves globally and we have made significant progress toward building a global commercial organization with leadership in place overseeing 13 initial countries. We are doing this using a specialized and comprehensive patient-centric approach. Our orphan-focused commercial model will include a small, highly focused salesforce in each country that we are targeting, complemented by medical affairs and a high touch support program to assist both patients and healthcare providers. We are preparing for approval and launch of volanesorsen in mid-2018.
 
Our global commercial organization is initially focused on our nearest term opportunities with volanesorsen to treat patients with FCS and FPL. Our initial plan is to focus on lipid specialists, specialized endocrinologists and pancreatologists as our primary call points. We believe the relatively small number of specialized physicians treating FCS and FPL patients will allow us to address this market with a nimble, scalable organization. We are currently identifying patients and having them referred to specialists for treatment, which we believe will facilitate successful commercialization. Building awareness of this orphan disease among not only lipid specialists, but also referring physicians, is a key element of our pre-commercial and commercial plans. We are focused on disease education and market access, with the goal of ensuring that identified patients can most effectively obtain our drugs once commercialized. We are also creating the specialized support required to potentially address other rare disease patient populations.
 
Our approach will vary by market based on local health care practices and needs, but we are actively building services that can include reimbursement assistance, partnerships with specialty pharmacies, injection training and routine platelet monitoring, which we believe will enable strong integration with treating physicians and facilitate patient uptake and compliance. Reimbursement assistance may include activities such as a reimbursement hotline, patient assistance and insurance verification. We plan to include dedicated case managers as part of our support team who will work directly with patients, caregivers and healthcare providers to help patients start and stay on therapy.

Due to the specialized nature of managing FCS and FPL, there are a limited number of treating physicians.
 
 
● | In the United States, there are approximately:
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | 45 lipid treatment hubs; and
--+-----------------------------


● | 200 to 300 lipid specialists, with an additional 300 to 400 endocrinologists specializing in lipid disorders.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In Europe, there are approximately:
--+------------------------------------


● | 75 specialized lipid treatment hubs; and
--+-----------------------------------------


● | 400 to 600 physician specialists who treat lipid disorders.
--+------------------------------------------------------------



In North America and Europe, we are planning for an overall field force size of between 40 and 50 individuals in the U.S. and between 40 and 50 in the EU and Canada for the initial launch of volanesorsen in FCS, which we expect to be sufficient to target substantially all of the potential volanesorsen prescribers. This field force would include sales representatives, medical liaisons and personnel for reimbursement assistance and patient support. We formed wholly owned subsidiaries to support our initial pre-commercialization activities in the UK in 2016 and in Canada, France and Germany in 2017.
 
We expect to market our drugs to the same specialist call point as volanesorsen, enabling us to leverage this commercial organization as the core global infrastructure for all of our drugs. We plan to commercialize by ourselves any approved drugs with a rare disease or specialty focus. We may enter into strategic relationships to commercialize certain of our drugs, particularly in indications with large patient populations, as evidenced by our collaboration with Novartis. We believe Novartis brings significant resources and expertise to the collaboration that can accelerate our ability to deliver AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx to the large populations of patients who have high cardiovascular risk due to inadequately treated lipid disorders. We also plan to co-commercialize any such drug in selected markets, under terms and conditions that we plan to negotiate with Novartis in the future, through the specialized sales force we are building to commercialize volanesorsen.
 
Preparing for Successful Commercialization
 
A key aspect of successfully commercializing therapies for orphan diseases is to provide education on disease diagnosis to assist physicians in identifying eligible patients. Patient populations are frequently very small and sometimes heterogeneous. Our management team is experienced in maximizing patient identification for both clinical development and commercial purposes in orphan diseases. We also have significant experience in establishing the burden of disease in support of securing orphan pricing and reimbursement.
 
Our commercial organization is focused on the following priorities to prepare for the launch of volanesorsen:
 
 
● | Improve diagnosis by working with a small number of specialist physician experts to advance the understanding of the signs and symptoms of FCS and then communicate that simplified clinical diagnosis criteria to the broader physician and patient community.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Build a database of patients by working with physicians and patient organizations and through improved diagnosis and referrals. In order to protect patient confidentiality, we do not include patient-specific information in the database. We add blinded patient information to our database through communication with physicians, patient organizations and other tools, such as electronic medical record database searches. We plan to use our database to help us engage with physicians who may have patients who could potentially benefit from our drugs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Build an integrated high touch patient support team to help patients start and stay on therapy. We plan to provide support for patients to access our drug and to provide injection training, platelet monitoring and dietary support, as well as establish partnerships with specialty pharmacies, to help patients remain on therapy over the long term. We plan to include dedicated case managers as part of our support team who will work directly with patients, caregivers and healthcare providers to help patients start and stay on therapy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Prepare for successful market access through payors and other reimbursement authorities by establishing and quantifying the burden of disease associated with living with FCS.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Relationship with Ionis
 
We founded our operations in 2015 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ionis to develop and commercialize Ionis' drugs to treat lipid disorders. On July 19, 2017, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO. Ionis funded our expenses up until our IPO in July 2017. As of December 31, 2017, Ionis is our majority shareholder with approximately 68% ownership of our common stock. Although we expect Ionis to remain our principal stockholder for the foreseeable future, we are an independent company building a focus and excellence in development and commercialization.
 
As we prepare to launch volanesorsen and continue to build out our corporate functions, we expect to rely less on Ionis for support services. We currently have three main agreements that govern our relationship with Ionis: a development, commercialization and license agreement; a service agreement; and an investor rights agreement. Through our relationship with Ionis, we benefit in the following ways:
 
 
● | We have access to Ionis' innovative generation 2+ antisense and LICA technologies for use in our drugs. These technologies allow for precise specificity, favorable dosing properties and no anticipated drug-to-drug interactions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We obtained exclusive rights to globally commercialize a robust, mature pipeline of drugs, including volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development. Our licensed rights also include access to Ionis' intellectual property and expertise to develop, manufacture and commercialize these drugs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have a joint development program that provides us access to Ionis' development and regulatory organization, which has significant expertise in developing drugs to treat patients with lipid disorders. Ionis also provides resources to support our nonclinical and clinical studies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We contract with Ionis for support in areas such as legal, finance and human resources, which allows us to be more capital efficient than a typical company of our size and stage of development. This support allows us to focus our efforts and resources on developing and preparing to commercialize our drugs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are not required to make any upfront or pre-commercialization payments to Ionis for drugs we are developing under our development, commercialization and license agreement, as would be typical in a drug license. Our agreement allows us to more efficiently invest our capital in developing and preparing to commercialize our drugs, as we are only required to make milestone and royalty payments post-commercialization or if we grant a sublicense to Ionis' technology.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | As a result of our relationship with Ionis, we may have the opportunity to evaluate additional antisense drugs that may complement our efforts in becoming the premier lipid disease company. For example, Ionis has granted us a right of first negotiation with respect to Ionis development candidates that are designed to treat a rare cardiometabolic disease or a rare inherited metabolic disease.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



While we and Ionis intend our relationship to enhance our capabilities, certain terms of our relationship may limit our ability to achieve this expected benefit, including:
 
 
● | Some of our directors may have a conflict of interest because of their positions with Ionis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Joint Steering Committee, or JSC, sets the development and regulatory strategy for our drugs by mutual agreement. If the JSC cannot come to a mutual agreement, it could delay our ability to develop and commercialize our drugs in development.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We will need to mutually agree with Ionis on the terms of any additional sublicense to a third party for our drugs in development. If we cannot mutually agree, it could delay or prevent our ability to develop and commercialize our drugs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our agreements prevent Ionis from developing and commercializing drugs targeting apoC-III, apo(a) or ANGPTL3 RNA. However, our agreements do not prevent Ionis from developing and commercializing other drugs to pursue the same indications we are pursuing with our drugs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exclusive Rights to Development Pipeline and Intellectual Property; Right of First Negotiation
 
Ionis is the leading company researching and developing antisense drugs. Under our agreements with Ionis, we have rights to Ionis' proprietary technologies for use with our drugs. Specifically, we obtained an exclusive license from Ionis to globally commercialize our development pipeline of drugs, including volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. Ionis also agreed that it would not work on its own or with other parties to develop or commercialize antisense drugs that target the same gene targets as the drugs we are developing and commercializing. Under our agreements with Ionis, we have a license to use Ionis' technology platform with our drugs. We also have access to future improvements Ionis may make to its antisense technology platform, such as improved manufacturing technologies.
 
In addition, Ionis has granted us a right of first negotiation with respect to Ionis development candidates that are designed to treat a rare cardiometabolic disease or a rare inherited metabolic disease.
 
 29
 
Access to Ionis' Development, Regulatory and Manufacturing Expertise
 
Development
 
We receive access to Ionis' infrastructure and expertise in developing antisense drugs and, in particular, drugs to treat lipid disorders. We have a Joint Steering Committee comprised of Akcea and Ionis representatives who set the development strategy for each of our drugs. In addition, a team of Akcea and Ionis employees run each clinical study for our drugs. This way we can stay focused on developing our drugs and preparing for commercialization rather than immediately building an extensive development organization. Over time as we strategically expand our internal development capabilities, we plan to assume more and more responsibility for each development program. Because of our relationship with a much larger company like Ionis, we can use Ionis' relationships and negotiating power with clinical research organizations and other vendors to obtain lower pricing and better resourcing from these vendors than we otherwise could achieve on our own as a relatively new and smaller company. These benefits help us manage our development costs.
Regulatory
 
We take a similar approach to regulatory affairs as we do for drug development. We have a Joint Regulatory Committee comprised of Akcea and Ionis representatives that sets the regulatory strategy for each of our drugs. Because Ionis has filed over 30 investigational new drug applications, or INDs, for antisense drugs, and supported the approval of three new drug applications, or NDAs, for antisense drugs, Ionis understands how to successfully work with the FDA and other regulatory agencies. We can also benefit from Ionis' more than 25 years of knowledge regarding antisense drugs to prepare important sections of an IND or NDA. These are important benefits we can immediately access as we continue to build our own regulatory organization and assume more regulatory responsibility for our drugs.
Manufacturing
 
As the leader in antisense technology, Ionis has discovered many of the breakthroughs that have made it possible to manufacture antisense drugs at commercial scale and at a commercially feasible price. Through our relationship with Ionis, we enjoy the benefit of Ionis' historical and continuing investment in antisense drug manufacturing. Specifically, Ionis has supplied the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and, through its outside vendors, the finished drug product for the clinical studies for each of the drugs in our pipeline through the completion of the on-going studies. Ionis also has agreed to supply and has supplied the API and the finished drug product, which we believe is adequate for at least the first two years of volanesorsen's launch. Ionis has long-standing and strong relationships with third-party vendors who can supply us with both API and finished drug product and are currently supplying API and finished drug product to other of Ionis' partners. Ionis also has long-standing and strong relationships with the vendors who supply the key raw materials to Ionis to make our drugs and to the other major oligonucleotide contract manufacturers. We plan to use these relationships to establish our own long term raw material and drug supplies at competitive prices.
Infrastructure
 
When Ionis formed our company, a key premise was to initially utilize Ionis' existing infrastructure in areas like business development, finance, patents, legal, human resources, benefits and other general and administrative areas, so that we could remain critically focused on developing and preparing to commercialize our drugs and could more efficiently utilize our capital. By taking advantage of Ionis' existing infrastructure in these areas, we can spend very little of our management and financial resources building these functions ourselves. As we commercialize our drugs, we expect to be able to expand this infrastructure with a relatively modest additional investment. We can use Ionis' extensive corporate partnering expertise and resources to help us if and when we choose to partner our drugs for the larger indications.
Payment Structure Under our Agreements with Ionis
 
We have agreed to pay Ionis for the services it provides us. We intentionally designed our agreements with Ionis to allow us to invest our initial capital to develop and prepare to commercialize our drugs. We were not required to make an upfront cash payment to license Ionis' drugs and technology. In addition, other than paying Ionis the cost of the support services Ionis provides to us, we are not required to make significant payments to Ionis until we successfully commercialize or partner our drugs. For drug development Ionis conducts on our behalf, we reimburse Ionis for its out-of-pocket expenses and for the cost of Ionis' employees who conduct the research and development activities for our drugs. For general and administrative services, we pay Ionis for our share of internal and external expenses for each of the functions they provide based on our relative use of each function, plus an allocation of facility-related expenses.
 
For the drugs we commercialize ourselves, we will pay Ionis royalties from the mid-teens to the mid-twenty percent rage on sales related to those drugs. If we sell a drug for an orphan disease indication, defined in our agreement as less than 500,000 patients worldwide, or an indication that required a Phase 3 program of less than 1,000 patients and less than two years of treatment, we pay a higher royalty rate to Ionis than we do if we sell a drug for a disease having more than 500,000 patients worldwide or an indication that required a Phase 3 program of 1,000 or more patients and two or more years of treatment. Other than with respect to the drugs licensed to Novartis under the strategic collaboration, option and license agreement, if our annual sales reach $500.0 million, $1.0 billion and $2.0 billion, we will pay Ionis sales milestones in the amount of $50.0 million for each sales milestone reached by each drug, spread in equal installments over the 12 quarters following the milestone event.
 
 30
 

For drugs we sublicense to a commercial partner, we will share 50% of any revenue from the commercial partner with Ionis, excluding money received from our partner specifically designated to fund future development costs and money we are obligated to spend to co-commercialize a drug. Regarding our Novartis collaboration, we paid Ionis $15.0 million of the $75.0 million upfront option payment we received from Novartis. We will pay Ionis 50% of any additional payments we receive from Novartis, excluding money received specifically designated to fund future development costs and money we are obligated to spend to co-commercialize a drug.
 
Line of Credit Agreement
 
In January 2017, we entered into a line of credit agreement with Ionis for up to $150.0 million. We had $106.0 million outstanding as of June 30, 2017, prior to our IPO. We used a portion of the $106.0 million to pay our intercompany expenses. The amounts we borrowed under the line of credit bore interest at an annual interest rate of 4%, compounded monthly. The outstanding principal and accrued interest under our line of credit converted into 13,438,339 shares of our common stock in connection with the closing of our IPO. We no longer have access to this line of credit following the closing of our IPO. After the IPO through the date of this filing, there has been no line of credit or any other financing arrangement with Ionis.
Our Strategic Collaboration with Novartis
 
In January 2017, we initiated a strategic collaboration with Novartis for the development and commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. Under the strategic collaboration, option and license agreement, Novartis has an exclusive option to develop and commercialize these drugs. We are responsible for completing a Phase 2 program and conducting an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA for each drug and delivering API. Following the successful completion of each Phase 2 program, and prior to initiation of the Phase 3 study, Novartis will be able to exercise its option to license and commercialize each drug. Novartis will have 60 days following the end of the applicable end-of-Phase 2 meeting to exercise its option for each of these drugs. If Novartis exercises its option for a drug, Novartis will be responsible, at its expense, to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize that drug. We received $75.0 million in an upfront option payment, of which we retained $60.0 million and paid Ionis $15.0 million as a sublicense fee under our license agreement with Ionis. In conjunction with this collaboration, Novartis purchased $100.0 million of Ionis' common stock at a premium. During 2017, we recognized $55.2 million of revenue related to our Novartis collaboration.
 
If Novartis exercises its option for a drug, Novartis will pay us a license fee equal to $150.0 million for each drug licensed by Novartis. In addition, for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, we are eligible to receive up to $600.0 million in substantive milestone payments, including $25.0 million for the achievement of a development milestone, up to $290.0 million for the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to $285.0 million for the achievement of commercialization milestones. In addition, for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, we are eligible to receive up to $530.0 million in substantive milestone payments, including $25.0 million for the achievement of a development milestone, up to $240.0 million for the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to $265.0 million for the achievement of commercialization milestones. We will earn the next milestone payment of $25.0 million under this collaboration if Novartis advances the Phase 3 study for either drug. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties in the mid-teens to low-twenty percent range on net sales of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. Novartis will reduce these royalties upon the expiration of certain patents or if a generic competitor negatively impacts the product in a specific country. We will pay 50% of these license fees, milestone payments and royalties to Ionis as a sublicense fee.
 
For each product Novartis commercializes under this agreement, we will have the right to co-commercialize the product with Novartis in selected markets, through the specialized sales force we are building to commercialize volanesorsen, on terms and conditions that we plan to negotiate with Novartis in the future.
 
If Novartis does not exercise its option, or stops developing or commercializing after exercising its option with respect to a particular drug, we will have all rights to develop or commercialize the drug (including the right to sublicense these rights to a third party) at our sole expense. If Novartis stops developing or commercializing a drug after exercising its option, and we subsequently commercialize the drug on our own or with another party, we are required to negotiate in good faith and mutually agree with Novartis the terms of a royalty payable to Novartis on the returned drug.
 
The agreement with Novartis will continue until the earlier of the date that all of Novartis' options to obtain the exclusive licenses under the agreement expire unexercised or, if Novartis exercises its options, until the expiration of all payment obligations under the agreement. In addition, the agreement as a whole or with respect to any drug under the agreement may terminate early under the following situations:
 
 
● | Novartis may terminate the agreement as a whole or with respect to any drug at any time by providing written notice to us;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Either we or Novartis may terminate the agreement with respect to any drug by providing written notice to the other party in good faith that we or Novartis have determined that the continued development or commercialization of the drug presents safety concerns that pose an unacceptable risk or threat of harm in humans or would violate any applicable law, ethical principles or principles of scientific integrity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Either we or Novartis may terminate the agreement for a drug by providing written notice to the other party upon the other party's uncured failure to perform a material obligation related to the drug under the agreement, or the entire agreement if the other party becomes insolvent; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may terminate the agreement if Novartis disputes or assists a third party to dispute the validity of any of our or Ionis' patents.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 31
 

Additionally, in January 2017, we and Ionis entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, or SPA, with Novartis. Under the SPA, in July 2017, Novartis purchased $50.0 million of our common stock in a separate private placement concurrent with the completion of our IPO at a price per share equal to the IPO price.
 
Competition
 
The commercialization of new drugs is competitive, and we may face worldwide competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, nutraceutical companies and ultimately generic companies. Our competitors may develop or market therapies that are more effective, safer, more convenient to use, or less costly than any that we are commercializing, or may obtain regulatory or reimbursement approval for their therapies more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Additionally, mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields.
 
With respect to volanesorsen to treat patients with FCS, we believed Glybera, which is a gene therapy made by uniQure N.V., could compete with volanesorsen. However, in October 2017, uniQure announced that Glybera's marketing authorization in Europe was not renewed and Glybera was taken off the market. UniQure has previously announced it is not pursuing approval in the Unites States. Gemphire Therapeutics' Gemcabene is being studied in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, defined as triglycerides above 500 mg/dL and Gemphire expects to report top-line results from its Phase 2 study in the second quarter of 2018.
 
Metreleptin is in a Phase 3 trial for FPL patients who also have NASH. Metreleptin is currently approved for use in generalized lipodystrophy, or GL, patients. The FDA denied initial approval in FPL patients, not all of whom are leptin deficient, the mechanism by which metreleptin works. In December 2016, Novelion Therapeutics, Inc. submitted a marketing authorization application to the EMA seeking approval for Metreleptin as replacement therapy to treat complications of leptin deficiency in a small subset of FPL patients and in patients with GL, and for which decision is expected in the first half of 2018. An investigator-sponsored study is currently ongoing with the support of Novelion to evaluate Metreleptin in FPL patients who also have NASH. Metreleptin does not affect apoC-III levels. ApoC-III levels have been shown to be elevated in FPL patients and directly correlated to triglyceride levels. To our knowledge, there are currently no other direct competitors for lowering apoC-III in clinical development.
 
In addition, many patients with FCS and FPL use diet, niacin, fish oils and/or fibrates to reduce their elevated triglycerides. Niacin, fish oils and fibrates are generally not effective in patients with FCS. The ultra-low-fat diet that patients with FCS and FPL are required to maintain is extremely burdensome to patients and their families. Based on our volanesorsen clinical experience, including in individuals with FCS, we believe that volanesorsen will work equally well as a single agent or in combination with other triglyceride-lowering drugs or approaches.
 
With respect to AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, we are not aware of any other drugs currently in clinical development specifically for the treatment of hyperlipoproteinemia(a) and associated cardiovascular disease. In September 2016, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Amgen Inc. announced a license and collaboration for development of Arrowhead's preclinical program, ARO-LPA, which uses an RNAi drug conjugated with a GalNAc for the same target as AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. It is possible that other competitors may produce, develop and commercialize drugs, or utilize other approaches, to treat patients with CVD. Under its strategic collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Alnylam, Ionis received an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to Alnylam's chemistry, RNA targeting mechanism and target-specific intellectual property for oligonucleotides against apo(a), which means that Alnylam agreed not to use the exclusively licensed technology to develop or commercialize an oligonucleotide against apo(a).
 
AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx may compete with a monoclonal antibody that binds to ANGPTL3 that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing, currently in Phase 2 development for the treatment of HoFH and severe forms of hyperlipidemia. Additionally, many patients with familial hyperlipidemias are treated using diet and statins, which have limited effect in these patients.
 
AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx may compete with gemcabene, an oral small molecule that reduces apoC-III, that Gemphire Therapeutics, Inc. is developing to treat patients with triglycerides above 500 mg/dL. Gemphire is conducting a Phase 2 study of gemcabene in patients with severely high triglycerides and expects to report top-line results in the second quarter of 2018. We are aware of other approaches such as RNA interference, or RNAi, that are in preclinical development for apoC-III-driven cardiometabolic disease.
 
 32
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, our other drugs in development and, more generally, the development and commercialization of oligonucleotide therapeutics. Our objective is to continue to develop and strengthen our proprietary position to further protect our drugs.
 
We obtained our rights to the patents covering volanesorsen, AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx and our other drugs in development and our rights in Ionis' proprietary technology platform and know-how under our development, commercialization and license agreement with Ionis. We seek to expand our portfolio of patents and patent applications by filing and prosecuting existing patent rights and filing additional patent applications.
 
We seek patent protection in significant markets and/or countries for each drug in development. We also seek to maximize patent term. The patent exclusivity period for a drug will prevent generic drugs from entering the market. Patent exclusivity depends on a number of factors, including initial patent term and available patent term extensions based upon delays caused by the regulatory approval process.
 
ApoC-III, Volanesorsen and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx Intellectual Property
 
We have an exclusive license under Ionis' apoC-III patent estate to develop and commercialize volanesorsen and the LICA follow-on drug AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. The apoC-III patent estate includes patent claims in the United States drawn to the use of antisense compounds complementary to the mRNA of human apoC-III, including compounds designed to the region targeted by volanesorsen and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx (US 7,598,227) which, excluding any additional term adjustments or patent term extensions, expires in 2023. Similar claims covering compounds complementary to any site on human apoC-III have granted in Australia.
 
The apoC-III patent estate also includes issued patent claims to the specific antisense sequence and chemical composition of volanesorsen in the United States (US 7,750,141), Australia and Europe (EP1622597). The issued claims in the United States should protect volanesorsen from generic competition in the United States until at least 2023. In addition, depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA regulatory review, this patent may be eligible for patent term restoration to recapture a portion of the term lost during such review. We are also pursuing additional patent applications directed to methods of using volanesorsen and other apoC-III compounds for treating various disorders, including FCS in jurisdictions worldwide. Claims drawn to methods of using apoC-III specific inhibitors, and specifically compounds designed to target the same sequence as volanesorsen and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, for treating FCS have issued in the United States (US 9,593,333) and will expire in 2034, excluding any additional term adjustments or patent term extensions.
 
The apoC-III patent estate also includes issued patent claims covering the specific chemical composition of AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in the United States (US 9,163,239). The claims should protect AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx from generic competition until at least 2034. We are pursuing additional patent coverage for AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx in jurisdictions worldwide.
 
Apo(a) and AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx Intellectual Property
 
We have an exclusive license under Ionis' apo(a) patent estate to develop and commercialize AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx. The apo(a) patent estate includes issued patent claims to the specific antisense sequence and chemical composition of AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx in the United States (US 9,181,550). The issued claims directed to the composition should protect AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx from generic competition in the United States until at least 2034. In addition, patent term restoration may be available to recapture a portion of the term lost during FDA regulatory review. We are also pursuing additional patent applications designed to protect the AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx composition and additional dosing and methods of use in jurisdictions worldwide.
 
ANGPTL3 and AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx Intellectual Property
 
We have an exclusive license under Ionis' ANGPTL3 patent estate to develop and commercialize AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx. The ANGPTL3 patent estate includes issued patent claims drawn to the use of antisense compounds complementary to ANGPTL3 RNA for inhibiting the production of ANGPTL3 (US 8,653,047). The ANGPTL3 patent estate also includes issued patent claims covering the specific antisense sequence and chemical composition of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in the United States (US 9,382,540). The issued claims directed to the chemical composition should protect AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx from generic competition until at least 2035. We are pursuing additional patent claims designed to protect the sequence and chemical composition of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx in jurisdictions worldwide.
 
 33
 
Trade Secrets
 
In addition to the protections afforded by patents and other regulatory protections, we may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. Trade secrets may be useful to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or which we elect not to patent. Trade secrets may also be useful for processes or improvements for which patents are difficult to enforce. We also protect our drugs and the proprietary technology platform by confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
Manufacturing
 
We believe we have sufficient manufacturing capacity, through Ionis, to meet our current development needs, including the Phase 3 clinical study for volanesorsen and Phase 2 studies for AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx, AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx. We believe that we have, or will be able to develop or acquire, sufficient supply capacity to meet our anticipated future needs. Ionis has supplied the API and the finished drug product for the clinical studies for each of the drugs in our pipeline through the completion of the on-going studies. Ionis also has agreed to supply and has supplied the API and the finished drug product, which we believe is adequate for at least the first two years of volanesorsen's launch. Ionis has long-standing and strong relationships with third-party vendors who can supply us with both API and finished drug product, and are currently supplying API and finished drug product to other of Ionis' partners. Ionis also has long-standing and strong relationships with the vendors who supply the key raw materials to Ionis to make our drugs and to the other major oligonucleotide contract manufacturers. We also believe that with anticipated benefits from increases in scale and improvements in chemistry, through Ionis or third parties, we will be able to manufacture our antisense drugs at commercially reasonable prices.
 
In the past, except for small quantities, it was generally expensive and difficult to produce chemically modified oligonucleotides like antisense drugs. As a result, Ionis dedicated significant resources to develop ways to improve manufacturing efficiency and capacity. Since Ionis can use variants of the same nucleotide building blocks and the same type of equipment to produce their oligonucleotide drugs, they found that the same techniques used to efficiently manufacture one oligonucleotide drug could help improve the manufacturing processes for many other oligonucleotide drugs. By developing several proprietary chemical processes to scale up their manufacturing capabilities, Ionis has greatly reduced the cost of producing oligonucleotide drugs. For example, Ionis has significantly reduced the cost of raw materials through improved yield efficiency, while at the same time increasing its capacity to make the drugs. Through both Ionis' internal research and development programs and collaborations with outside vendors, we may benefit from even greater efficiency and further cost reductions. In addition, if Novartis exercises its option to license AKCEA-APO(a)-LRx or AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx, Novartis will be responsible for the long-term supply of drug substance and finished drug product for the licensed drug.
 
For LICA-conjugated drugs, to date, Ionis has manufactured itself or through a contract manufacturing organization only limited supplies of LICA for their own and our own nonclinical and clinical studies. LICA enables lower doses than unconjugated oligonucleotides. Along with Ionis' expertise in optimizing manufacturing of oligonucleotides, we believe this will enable the development of new processes to scale up manufacturing of these LICA conjugated drugs at commercially competitive prices.
 
Government Regulation and Approval
 
United States—FDA Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of drugs. To obtain regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, and subsequently comply with applicable statutes and regulations, we will need to spend substantial time and financial resources.
 
 34
 
Approval Process
 
The FDA must approve any new unapproved drug or a drug with certain changes to a previously approved drug before a manufacturer can market it in the United States. If a company does not comply with applicable United States requirements, it may be subject to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending applications, Warning or Untitled Letters, clinical holds, drug recalls, drug seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. The steps we must complete before we can market a drug include:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical studies start. The sponsor must update the IND annually;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval of the study by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical study begins;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication to the FDA's satisfaction;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


● | potential review of the drug application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, cGMP, or regulations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------



It generally takes companies many years to satisfy the FDA approval requirements, but this varies substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the drug or disease. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of a drug's chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the drug. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The company submits the results of the preclinical testing to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about the drug's chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical study protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after submitting the initial IND.
 
The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND before a company can begin clinical testing in humans in the United States. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the IND sponsor may begin the proposed clinical study. However, the FDA may, within the 30-day time period, raise concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical studies and place the clinical study on a clinical hold. In such a case, the company and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the company begins the clinical study. Accordingly, the submission of an IND may or may not be sufficient for the FDA to permit the sponsor to start a clinical study. The company must also make a separate submission to an existing IND for each successive clinical study conducted during drug development.
 
Clinical Studies
 
Clinical studies involve administering the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The company must conduct clinical studies:

● | in compliance with federal regulations;
--+----------------------------------------


● | in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical study sponsors, administrators and monitors; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the safety monitoring parameters and the effectiveness criteria.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The company must submit each protocol involving testing on United States patients and subsequent protocol amendments to the FDA as part of the IND. The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical study at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the sponsor is not conducting the clinical study in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical study patients. The sponsor must also submit the study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical studies to an IRB for approval. An IRB may halt the clinical study, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 
 35
 

Companies generally divide the clinical investigation of a drug into three or four phases.
 
 
● | Phase 1. The company evaluates the drug in healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies typically evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational new drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. The company administers the drug to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. The company administers the drug to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites, to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a drug on the company's agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. We typically refer to such post-approval studies as Phase 4 clinical studies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



While companies usually conduct these phases sequentially, they are sometimes overlapped or combined. A combined phase trial, such as a Phase 1/2 or a Phase 2/3 trial, is one that combines elements of objectives from two ordinarily sequential phases of development. For example, in a Phase 1/2 trial, the objectives may include both dose-finding and initial efficacy. In a Phase 2/3 trial, dosing regimen or population selection objectives are combined with confirmation of the safety and efficacy of the administration schedule in the intended population.
 
A pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements to evaluate a drug's efficacy and safety to justify the approval of the drug. Generally, pivotal studies are Phase 3 studies, but the FDA may accept results from Phase 2 studies if the study design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations in which there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust.
 
The FDA, the IRB or the clinical study sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, may oversee some clinical studies. This group provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical study based on evolving business objectives and the competitive climate.
 
Submission of an NDA
 
After we complete the required clinical testing, we can prepare and submit an NDA to the FDA, which must approve the NDA before we can start marketing the drug in the United States. An NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the drug's chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies on a drug, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing authorization, the data we submit must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug to the FDA's satisfaction.
 
The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to annual drug and establishment user fees. The FDA typically increases these fees annually. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers.
 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether it will accept the application for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the FDA accepts the filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of responding to standard review NDAs within ten months after the 60-day filing review period, but this timeframe is often extended. The FDA reviews most applications for standard review drugs within ten to 12 months and most applications for priority review drugs within six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists.
 
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee. This is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts that will review, evaluate and recommend whether the FDA should approve the application. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the drug unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 
 36
 
The FDA's Decision on an NDA
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter indicates that the FDA has completed its review of the application and the agency has determined that it will not approve the application in its present form. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional clinical data and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical studies, preclinical studies and/or manufacturing. The FDA has committed to reviewing resubmissions of the NDA addressing such deficiencies in two or six months, depending on the type of information included. Even if we submit such data, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Also, the government may establish additional requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, or the FDA's policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our drugs under development.
 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, the FDA may condition approval on substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy. Once granted, the FDA may withdraw drug approvals if the company fails to comply with regulatory standards or identifies problems following initial marketing.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before we can implement the change. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing new NDAs. As with new NDAs, the FDA often significantly extends the review process with requests for additional information or clarification.
 
Expedited review and accelerated approval programs
 
A sponsor may seek approval of its drug candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA's review and approval of NDAs. For example, the FDA may grant Fast Track Designation to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that has potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The key benefits of Fast Track Designation are the eligibility for priority review, rolling review (submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted), and accelerated approval, if the application meets relevant criteria. Based on results of the Phase 3 clinical study(ies) submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The FDA grants priority review where there is evidence that the proposed drug would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If the criteria for priority review are not met, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 
Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve an NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. The FDA generally requires post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing authorization to verify the drug's clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its drug candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug can, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
 
Post-approval Requirements
 
The FDA regulates drugs that we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA approvals and has specific requirements pertaining to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, drug sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. After approval, the FDA must provide review and approval for most changes to the approved drug, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed drugs and the establishments who manufacture our drugs, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 
 37
 

In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a drug on the sponsor's agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. We typically refer to such post-approval studies as Phase 4 clinical studies.
 
Drug manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. There are strict regulations regarding changes to the manufacturing process, and depending on the significance of the change, it may require prior FDA approval before we can implement it. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of our drugs and we expect to rely in the future on third parties for the production of commercial quantities. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a drug, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the drug from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial actions that could delay or prohibit further marketing.
 
The FDA may withdraw approval if a company does not comply with regulatory requirements and maintain standards or if problems occur after the drug reaches the market. If a company or the FDA discovers previously unknown problems with a drug, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, issues with manufacturing processes or the company's failure to comply with regulatory requirements, the FDA may require revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; impose post-marketing studies or other clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or impose distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences may include:
 
 
● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the drug, complete withdrawal of the drug from the market or drug recalls;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA refusing to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspending or revoking drug license approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | drug seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of drugs; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------



The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. We could be subject to significant liability if we violated these laws and regulations.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States.
 
Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a drug receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the drug has orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the drug with orphan exclusivity.
 
Pediatric Information
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which the FDA has granted an orphan designation.
 
 38
 
U.S. Patent Term Restoration
 
Patent term can also be extended based on the amount of time the patented drug spends in regulatory review for drug approval. The length of time between drug launch and patent expiration is significantly less than the full 20-year patent term because companies often obtain the patents relating to a drug early in development and the development path for regulatory approval is long. In the United States, The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called patent term restoration, for a patent on a drug governed by the FDCA. The length of patent term restoration is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term restoration can be a maximum of 5 years and cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of drug approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug in that jurisdiction.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
 
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD.
 
Specifically, in order to approve an ANDA, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the RLD. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to an RLD if "the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug…"
 
Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates that the generic drug is "therapeutically equivalent" to the RLD and it assigns a therapeutic equivalence rating to the approved generic drug in its publication "Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations," also referred to as the "Orange Book." Physicians and pharmacists consider an "AB" therapeutic equivalence rating to mean that a generic drug is fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA's designation of an "AB" rating often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
 
The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application, and are not bioavailability or bioequivalence studies. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.
 
Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-month Stay
 
Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors must list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant's drug or a method of using the drug. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference drug in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
 
 
● | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


● | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new drug.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



A certification that the new drug will not infringe the already approved drug's listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the FDA will not approve the ANDA application until all the listed patents claiming the referenced drug have expired.
 
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
 39
 
Disclosure of Clinical Study Information
 
Sponsors of clinical studies of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical study information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical study is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical studies after completion. Disclosure of the results of these studies can be delayed until the new drug or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Healthcare Reform
 
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of the PPACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are, among others, the following:

● | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, unless the drug is subject to discounts under the 340B drug discount program;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | new requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act for drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new requirement to annually report certain drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to licensed practitioners, or to pharmacies of hospitals or other healthcare entities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Since its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to or proposals to amend certain aspects of PPACA. We expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to it in the future.
 
In addition, other health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States since PPACA was enacted. For example, as a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011, providers are subject to Medicare payment reductions of 2% per fiscal year through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments from providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
 
European Union—EMA Process
 
In the European Union, drugs follow a similar demanding process as that we described above for the United States and the ICH Common Technical Document is the basis for applications. Prior to submitting a European Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, it is necessary to gain approval of a detailed Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, with the European Medicines Agency's Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. After gaining PIP approval, EU regulatory authorities can authorize the drug using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
 
 40
 
Centralized Procedure
 
Under the centralized procedure, after the EMA issues an opinion, the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that: are derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering; contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; and are officially designated orphan drugs. For drugs that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the drug concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health. Volanesorsen has been granted a Promising Innovative Medicine, or PIM, Designation by the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, for the treatment of people with FCS. A PIM Designation is an early indication that a medicinal product is a promising candidate for the Early Access to Medicines Scheme, or EAMS, in the UK, intended for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a life-threatening or seriously debilitating condition, with the potential to address an unmet medical need.
National Authorization Procedures
 
There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:

● | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that does not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Thereafter, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.

Good Manufacturing Practices
 
Like the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States, and other regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacturing of drugs prior to approving a drug. If, after receiving clearance from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. Once we or our partners commercialize drugs, we will be required to comply with cGMP and drug-specific regulations enforced by the European Commission, the EMA and the competent authorities of European Union Member States following drug approval. Also like the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States, and other regulatory agencies also conduct regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities and processes following the initial approval of a drug. If, as a result of these inspections, the regulatory agencies determine that our or our partners' equipment, facilities, or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of drug approval, they may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations or the withdrawal of our drug from the market.
Data and Market Exclusivity
 
Similar to the United States, there is a process to authorize generic versions of innovative drugs in the European Union. Generic competitors can submit abridged applications to authorize generic versions of drugs authorized by EMA through a centralized procedure referencing the innovator's data and demonstrating bioequivalence to the reference drug, among other things. New drugs in the European Union can receive eight years of data exclusivity coupled with two years of market exclusivity, and a potential one-year extension, if the marketing authorizations holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that demonstrates "significant clinical benefit" in comparison with existing therapies. This system is usually referred to as "8+2." Abridged applications cannot rely on an innovator's data until after expiry of the eight-year date exclusivity term, meaning that a competitor can file an application for a generic drug, but the drug cannot be marketed until the end of the market exclusivity term.
Other International Markets—Drug Approval Process
 
In some international markets (such as China or Japan), although data generated in United States or European Union studies may be submitted in support of a marketing authorization application, regulators may require additional clinical studies conducted in the host territory, or studying people of the ethnicity of the host territory, prior to the filing or approval of marketing applications within the country.

Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drugs for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in other countries, sales of any drugs for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drugs on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drugs can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor's decision to cover a particular drug does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development.
 
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of drugs and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. To obtain coverage and reimbursement for any drug that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our drug. These studies will be in addition to the studies required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a drug to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the drug after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its drugs at a profit.
 
The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic drugs for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the PPACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drugs, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies' share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for our drugs.
 
In the European community, governments influence the price of drugs through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those drugs to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which drugs may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new drugs. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 
The marketability of any drugs for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the focus on cost containment measures in the United States and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if we attain favorable coverage and reimbursement status for one or more drugs for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and similar foreign, state and local government authorities, regulate sales, promotion and other activities following drug approval. As described above, the FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for drugs under its jurisdiction both prior to and after approval. Only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that the FDA has approved may be used in labeling. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug's labeling and that differ from those we tested and the FDA approved. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties and often reflect a physician's belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for the patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label uses. If we do not comply with applicable FDA requirements, we may face adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. Promotion of off-label uses of drugs can also implicate the false claims laws described below.

In the United States sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare "fraud and abuse," including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions, limited statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations and very few court decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Moreover, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the PPACA among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes to clarify that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, PPACA clarifies that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment, to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our drugs may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees, including criminal sanctions against executive officers under the so-called "responsible corporate officer" doctrine, even in situations where the executive officer did not intend to violate the law and was unaware of any wrongdoing.
 
Given the significant penalties and fines that can be imposed on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of such violations often result in settlements even if the company or individual being investigated admits no wrongdoing. Settlements often include significant civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and corporate integrity agreements. If the government were to allege or convict us or our executive officers of violating these laws, our business could be harmed. In addition, private individuals can bring similar actions. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities. Other healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; analogous state laws governing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Further, there are an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state authorities.
 
Similar rigid restrictions are imposed on the promotion and marketing of drugs in the European Union and other countries. Even in those countries where we may not be directly responsible for the promotion and marketing of our drugs, if our potential international distribution partners engage in inappropriate activity it can have adverse implications for us.
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party, or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
Employees
 
As of February 20, 2018, we employed 100 people. A significant number of our management and professional employees have had prior experience with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. Collective bargaining agreements do not cover any of our employees and management considers relations with our employees to be good.
