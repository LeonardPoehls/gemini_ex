Utility Group
The Utility Group consists of the Company’s regulated operations and other operations that provide information technology and other support services to those regulated operations.  The Company segregates its regulated operations between a Gas Utility Services operating segment and an Electric Utility Services operating segment.  The Gas Utility Services segment includes the operations of Indiana Gas, VEDO, and SIGECO’s natural gas distribution business and provides natural gas distribution and transportation services to nearly two-thirds of Indiana and about 20 percent of Ohio, primarily in the west-central area.  The Electric Utility Services segment includes the operations of SIGECO’s electric transmission and distribution services, which provides electric transmission and distribution services to southwestern Indiana, and includes its power generating and wholesale power operations.  In total, these regulated operations supply natural gas and electricity to over one million customers.  Following is a more detailed description of the Utility Group’s Gas Utility and Electric Utility operating segments.
Gas Utility Services
In 2017, the Company supplied natural gas service to approximately 1,022,000 Indiana and Ohio customers, including 934,800 residential, 85,500 commercial, and 1,700 industrial and other contract customers.  Gas utility customers served were approximately 1,014,000 in 2016 and 1,004,800 in 2015.
The Company’s service area contains diversified manufacturing and agriculture-related enterprises.  The principal industries served include automotive assembly, parts and accessories; feed, flour and grain processing; metal castings, plastic products; gypsum products; electrical equipment, metal specialties, glass and steel finishing; pharmaceutical and nutritional products; gasoline and oil products; ethanol; and coal mining.  The largest Indiana communities served are Evansville, Bloomington, Terre Haute, suburban areas surrounding Indianapolis and Indiana counties near Louisville, Kentucky.  The largest community served outside of Indiana is Dayton, Ohio.
Revenues
The Company receives gas revenues by selling gas directly to customers at approved rates or by transporting gas through its pipelines at approved rates to customers that have purchased gas directly from other producers, brokers, or marketers.  Total throughput was 219.3 MMDth for the year ended December 31, 2017.  Gas sold and transported to residential and commercial customers was 97.1 MMDth representing 44 percent of throughput.  Gas transported or sold to industrial and other contract customers was 122.2 MMDth representing 56 percent of throughput.   
For the year ended December 31, 2017, gas utility revenues were $812.7 million, of which residential customers accounted for 67 percent and commercial accounted for 22 percent. Industrial and other contract customers accounted for 11 percent of revenues. Rates for transporting gas generally provide for the same margins earned by selling gas under applicable sales tariffs.
Availability of Natural Gas
The volumes of gas sold are seasonal and affected by variations in weather conditions.  To meet seasonal demand, the Company’s Indiana gas utilities have storage capacity at eight active underground gas storage fields and three propane plants.  Periodically, purchased natural gas is injected into storage.  The injected gas is then available to supplement contracted and manufactured volumes during periods of peak requirements.  The volumes of gas per day that can be delivered during peak demand periods for each utility are located in “Item 2 Properties.”
Natural Gas Purchasing Activity in Indiana
The Indiana utilities enter into short-term and long-term contracts with third party suppliers to purchase natural gas. Certain contracts are firm commitments under five and ten-year arrangements. During 2017, the Company, through its utility subsidiaries, purchased all of its gas supply from third parties and 67 percent was from a single third party.

Natural Gas Purchasing Activity in Ohio
On April 30, 2008, the PUCO issued an order which approved an exit from the merchant function in the Company's Ohio service territory. As a result, substantially all of the Company's Ohio customers purchase natural gas directly from retail gas marketers rather than from the Company. Exiting the merchant function has not had a material impact on earnings or financial condition.  
Total Natural Gas Purchased Volumes
In 2017, Utility Holdings purchased 66.1 MMDth volumes of gas at an average cost of $4.02 per Dth inclusive of demand charges. The average cost of gas per Dth purchased for the previous four years was $3.75 in 2016, $3.96 in 2015, $5.42 in 2014, and $4.60 in 2013.
Electric Utility Services
In 2017, the Company supplied electric service to approximately 145,200 Indiana customers, including approximately 126,400 residential, 18,600 commercial, and 200 industrial and other customers.  Electric utility customers served were approximately 144,400 in 2016 and 143,600 in 2015.
The principal industries served include plastic products; automotive assembly and steel finishing; pharmaceutical and nutritional products; automotive glass; gasoline and oil products; ethanol; and coal mining.
Revenues
For the year ended December 31, 2017, retail electricity sales totaled 4,757.6 GWh, resulting in revenues of approximately $527.2 million.  Residential customers accounted for 38 percent of 2017 revenues; commercial 29 percent; industrial 31 percent; and other 2 percent.  In addition, in 2017 the Company sold 463.2 GWh through wholesale activities principally to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO).  Wholesale revenues, including transmission-related revenue, totaled $42.4 million in 2017.
System Load
Total load for each of the years 2013 through 2017 at the time of the system summer peak, and the related reserve margin, is presented below in MW.

Date of summer peak load | 7/21/2017 | | 6/22/2016 | | 7/29/2015 | 8/27/2014 | | 8/30/2013

Generating Capability
Installed generating capability as of December 31, 2017, was rated at 1,248 MW.  Coal-fired generating units provide 1,000 MW of capacity, natural gas or oil-fired turbines used for peaking or emergency conditions provide 245 MW, and a landfill gas electric generation project provides 3 MW.  Electric generation for 2017 was fueled by coal (97 percent), natural gas (2 percent), and landfill gas (less than 1 percent).  Oil was used only for testing of gas/oil-fired peaking units.  The Company generated approximately 4,578 GWh in 2017.  Further information about the Company’s owned generation is included in “Item 2 Properties.”
Coal for coal-fired generating stations has been supplied from operators of nearby coal mines as there are substantial coal reserves in the southern Indiana area. Approximately 2.1 million tons were purchased for generating electricity during 2017. This compares to 1.9 million tons and 2.5 million tons purchased in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The utility’s coal inventory was approximately 800 thousand tons at both December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Coal Purchases
The average cost of coal per ton purchased and delivered for the last five years was $53.88 in 2017, $54.24 in 2016, $55.22 in 2015, $55.18 in 2014, and $58.38 in 2013.  Entering 2014, SIGECO had in place staggered term coal contracts with Vectren Fuels and one other supplier to provide supply for its generating units.  During 2014, SIGECO entered into separate negotiations with Vectren Fuels and Sunrise Coal, LLC (Sunrise Coal), an Indiana-based wholly owned subsidiary of Hallador Energy Company, to modify its existing contracts as well as enter into new long-term contracts in order to secure its supply of coal with specifications that support its compliance with the Mercury and Air Toxins Rule.  Subsequent to the sale of Vectren Fuels to Sunrise Coal in August 2014, all such contracts were assigned to Sunrise Coal and the Company purchases substantially all of its coal from Sunrise Coal. 
Firm Purchase Supply
As part of its power portfolio, SIGECO is a 1.5 percent shareholder in the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC), and based on its participation in the Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA) between OVEC and its shareholder companies, many of whom are regulated electric utilities, SIGECO has the right to 1.5 percent of OVEC’s generating capacity output, which is approximately 32 MWs.  Per the ICPA, SIGECO is charged demand charges which are based on OVEC’s operating expenses, including its financing costs. Those demand charges are available to pass through to customers under SIGECO's fuel adjustment clause. Under the ICPA, and while OVEC’s plants are operating, SIGECO is severally responsible for its share of OVEC’s debt obligations.  Based on OVEC’s current financing, SIGECO’s 1.5 percent share of OVEC's debt obligation equates to approximately $21 million.  Recently, due to concerns regarding the potential default of one of OVEC's shareholders that holds a 4.9 percent interest under the ICPA, Moody’s downgraded OVEC to Ba1 and Standard and Poor's revised its BBB- rating outlook from stable to negative.  OVEC has represented it has both liquidity and financing capability that will allow it to continue to operate and provide power to its participating members, who include American Electric Power, Duke Energy, and PPL Corporation. In 2017, the Company purchased approximately 141 GWh from OVEC. If a default were to occur by a member, any reallocation of the existing debt requires consent of the remaining ICPA participants. If any such reallocation were to occur, SIGECO would expect to recover any related costs through the fuel adjustment clause, as it does currently for its 1.5 percent share.
In April 2008, the Company executed a capacity contract with Benton County Wind Farm, LLC to purchase as much as 30 MW from a wind farm located in Benton County, Indiana, with IURC approval.  The contract expires in 2029.  In 2017, the Company purchased approximately 78 GWh under this contract.
In December 2009, the Company executed a 20 year power purchase agreement with Fowler Ridge II Wind Farm, LLC to purchase as much as 50 MW of energy from a wind farm located in Benton and Tippecanoe Counties in Indiana, with the approval of the IURC.  In 2017, the Company purchased 142 GWh under this contract. In total, wind resources provided 4 percent of total GWh sourced.
MISO Related Activity
The Company is a member of the MISO, a FERC approved regional transmission organization. The MISO serves the electric transmission needs of much of the Midcontinent region and maintains operational control over the Company’s electric transmission facilities as well as other utilities in the region. The Company is an active participant in the MISO energy markets, 
6

where it bids its generation into the Day Ahead and Real Time markets and procures power for its retail customers at Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) as determined by the MISO market. MISO-related purchase and sale transactions are recorded using settlement information provided by the MISO. These purchase and sale transactions are accounted for on a net hourly position. Net purchases in a single hour are recorded as purchased power in Cost of fuel & purchased power and net sales in a single hour are recorded in Electric utility revenues. During 2017, in hours when purchases from the MISO were in excess of generation sold to the MISO, the net purchases were 494 GWh. During 2017, in hours when sales to the MISO were in excess of purchases from the MISO, the net sales were 463 GWh. 
Interconnections
The Company has interconnections with Louisville Gas and Electric Company, Duke Energy Shared Services, Inc., Indianapolis Power & Light Company, Hoosier Energy Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc., and Big Rivers Electric Corporation providing the ability to simultaneously interchange approximately 900 MW during peak load periods. The Company, as required as a member of the MISO, has turned over operational control of the interchange facilities and its own transmission assets to the MISO. The Company in conjunction with the MISO must operate the bulk electric transmission system in accordance with NERC Reliability Standards. As a result, interchange capability varies based on regional transmission system configuration, generation dispatch, seasonal facility ratings, and other factors. The Company is in compliance with reliability standards promulgated by the NERC. Additionally, the Company is audited against those standards from time to time with no material issues or findings to date.

Regulatory, Environmental, and Sustainability Matters
See “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” regarding the Company’s regulatory environment, environmental, and sustainability matters.
Nonutility Group
The Company is involved in nonutility activities in two primary business areas: Infrastructure Services and Energy Services. 
Infrastructure Services
Infrastructure Services provides underground pipeline construction and repair services through wholly owned subsidiaries Miller Pipeline, LLC (Miller or Miller Pipeline) and Minnesota Limited, LLC (Minnesota Limited).  Infrastructure Services provides services to many utilities, including the Company’s utilities, as well as other industries.  Infrastructure Services generated approximately $996 million in revenues for 2017, compared to $813 million in 2016 and $843 million in 2015.  
Backlog represents the amount of revenue the Company expects to realize from work to be performed in the future on uncompleted contracts, including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun.  Infrastructure Services operates primarily under two types of contracts, blanket contracts and bid contracts.  Using blanket contracts, customers are not contractually committed to specific volumes of services, however the Company expects to be chosen to perform work needed by a customer in a given time frame.  These contracts are typically awarded on an annual or multi-year basis. For blanket work, backlog represents an estimate of the amount of revenue that the Company expects to realize from work to be performed in the next twelve months on existing contracts or contracts the Company reasonably expects to be renewed or awarded based upon recent history or discussions with customers. Under bid contracts, customers are contractually committed to a specific service to be performed for a specific price, whether in total for a project or on a per unit basis.  At December 31, 2017, Infrastructure Services had an estimated backlog of blanket contracts of $480 million and a backlog of bid contracts of $245 million, for a total backlog of $725 million.  The estimated backlog at December 31, 2016 was $435 million for blanket contracts and $290 million for bid contracts, for a total of $725 million. 
7

The backlog amounts above reflect estimates of revenues to be realized. Projects included in backlog can be subject to delays or cancellation as a result of regulatory requirements, adverse weather conditions, customer requirements, among other factors, which could cause actual revenue amounts to differ significantly from the estimates and revenues to be realized in periods other than originally expected.
See “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” regarding additional narrative of Infrastructure Services business matters.
Energy Services
Performance-based energy contracting operations and sustainable infrastructure, such as renewables, distributed generation and combined heat and power projects, are performed through Energy Systems Group, LLC (ESG), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  ESG assists schools, hospitals, governmental facilities, and other private institutions with reducing energy and maintenance costs by upgrading their facilities with energy-efficient equipment.  ESG is also involved in developing sustainable infrastructure projects.  ESG operates throughout the United States.  ESG generated revenues of approximately $282 million in 2017, compared to $260 million in 2016 and $200 million in 2015.  ESG’s backlog of fixed price construction projects at December 31, 2017 was $180 million, compared to $234 million at December 31, 2016.
See “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” regarding additional narrative of Energy Services business matters.
Other Businesses
The Company has an investment in and loans to ProLiance Holdings, LLC (ProLiance). On June 18, 2013, ProLiance Holdings exited the natural gas marketing business through the disposition of certain of the net assets, along with the long-term pipeline and storage commitments, of its energy marketing business, ProLiance Energy, LLC to a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners, ETC Marketing, Ltd. The Company's remaining investment in ProLiance relates to an investment in LA Storage, LLC. Consistent with its ownership percentage, the Company is allocated 61 percent of ProLiance’s profits and losses; however, governance and voting rights remain at 50 percent for each member; and therefore, the Company accounts for its investment in ProLiance using the equity method of accounting. Additional information regarding the investment in ProLiance is included in Note 5 in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.  
The Other Businesses group also includes a variety of other legacy investments. Details of these investments are included in Note 6 in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. 
Personnel
As of December 31, 2017, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 5,500 employees.  Of those employees, 700 are subject to collective bargaining arrangements negotiated by Utility Holdings and 2,800 are subject to collective bargaining arrangements negotiated by Infrastructure Services. 
Utility Holdings
In July 2017, the Company reached a three-year labor agreement with Local 1393 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and United Steelworkers of America Locals 12213 and 7441, ending December 1, 2020. This labor agreement relates to employees of Indiana Gas.
