Item 1. Business
Overview
 
BlastGard International, Inc. is in the business of providing protection for individuals and property. We have developed and have been marketing BlastWrap products to protect people and property against explosive forces. The Company owns 98.2% of HighCom Security, Inc. (“HighCom”) which provides a wide range of security and personal protective gear. Our protective gear includes shields, helmets, vests and plates which provide police and military with the protective gear they need to do their jobs.
 
Founded in 1997 and originally based in San Francisco, HighCom Security, Inc., a California corporation, is a global provider of security equipment. HighCom is a leader in advanced ballistic armor manufacturing. With a 32,865 square foot manufacturing and distribution facility located in Columbus, Ohio, HighCom is well positioned for large scale and time sensitive global supply needs. We design, manufacture and/or distribute a range of security products and personal protective gear. Our logistics network is now managed from our corporate headquarters in Clearwater, Florida. HighCom serves a wide range of customers throughout the world. Our North American customer base includes the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security. We cater to local law enforcement agencies, correctional facilities and municipal authorities, as well as large corporations. We export our products throughout the world and have in the past sold products in Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. Many of our products are controlled for export purposes and we require end user details prior to all sales. Strict compliance with U.S. and International laws and regulations is mandatory.
 
HighCom Certifications
 
HighCom has already implemented an in-depth ethics and compliance management and monitoring program that is tied to our International Standard Organization (“ISO”) certified quality processes. These policies and procedures outline each step within the compliance process and how they relate to, and should be acted upon, to ensure compliance with all local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations. Most importantly they address processes and policies that are related to compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”), Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (“DFAR”), International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”). Arms Export Control Act (“AECA”), Export Administration Act (“EAA”), Automated Export System (“AES”), and Office of Federal Activities (“OFA”). We also completed training internally and externally with regards to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other foreign business regulations that help our employees recognize red flags and potential risk situations.
 
In July 2014, HighCom Security became the first company in the world to achieve BA 9000 certification. Several years ago, the National Institute of Justice (“NIJ”) assembled a collaborative team to address the issue of body armor safety and the needs of criminal justice agencies. NIJ decided to increase the amount of testing needed for body armor to meet their standards, including 1) more extensive and frequent testing; 2) environmental testing; and 3) implementation of BA 9000, a body armor quality management standard. BA 9000, released in January 2012, is an extension of ISO 9001. BA 9000 extends to manufacturers of body armor vests for federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement and corrections bodies. Manufacturers who wish to become BA 9000 certified must comply with additional requirements beyond ISO 9001 that are specific to ballistics-resistant body armor manufacturing and testing, such as:
 

● | Provide procedures for communicating with the Compliance Testing Program (CTP). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Provide unique identification for each piece of the body armor to ensure accountability. 
● | Work areas must be managed in order to reduce negative effects on body armor. 
● | Product testing must be done at CTP approved labs, which need to be ISO 17025 compliant. 

 
Given the equipment and ballistic protection solutions provided by HighCom, compliance with the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of the Treasury and all other governmental agencies’ regulations is a high priority. In addition to this, the Company is also registered through the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls as well as the Bureau of Industry and Security (“BSI”). The purpose of these registrations is to allow the Company control over the export management and compliance program moving forward.

Management believes that we have an opportunity to combine the armor technology of HighCom with the blast mitigating technology of BlastGard and provide a combination of advancements in product technologies while focusing on USA made products for the United States Military and other governments and agencies worldwide. We have initiated numerous Research and Development projects according to National Institute of Justice’s (“NIJ”) body armor standards and testing. HighCom currently has 13 plates and vest solutions that qualify under the NIJ 0101.06 standard; and HighCom currently has 14 plates and vest solutions that qualify under the NIJ 0101.04 (Interim 2005) standard. We are currently marketing all of our NIJ 0101.04 and 0101.06 products to open market customers in law enforcement and military channels. We also have several protective gear products under development.
 
Another investment in late 2015 included the further expansion of our manufacturing facility for soft armor and helmets along with several pieces of manufacturing equipment to increase our production capabilities and efficiencies, along with the completion of our in-house ballistics and material science laboratory in 2013. The lab is a critical element for testing and evaluation as well as a major marketing point for many customers who in visiting the plant will also be invited to witness live ballistic testing of our products. The lab will also enable us to address another critical area of our quality controls - validating and verifying our raw materials for hardness tests, density, performance and yields. This way we can make sure the materials we purchase from our vendors conform to specifications and that we can improve the weight and cost of our finished product while maintaining complete control over the intellectual property of new products.
 
Also in late 2013, we created our new web site which provides valuable information for our agents, distributors and customers. We have also engaged current social media marketing tools to further promote the company. We are seeing more growth every day to our social media pages and product reviews on our website.
 
In addition to several new NIJ certifications secured in 2016, the National Tactical Officers Association (NTOA) tested several of our products. The mission of the NTOA is to enhance the performance and professional status of law enforcement personnel by providing a credible and proven training resource as well as a forum for the development of tactics and information exchange. HighCom has 9 vest and plate products that are “Member Tested and Approved” by NTOA. HighCom can now use the NTOA logo to attest that our products were tested and approved by NTOA. This further validates and highlights HighCom as the leader in quality, customer service and pricing.
 
The Company also increased its product liability insurance from the industry standard $1,000,000 to $10,000,000. Our goal is focused on the safety of the military and law enforcement personnel who employ our products in the field. We also value the relationships we are establishing with our distributors, re-sellers, and partners. This increase in our coverage demonstrates our commitment and support to both our clients and their customers on a global basis.
 
We have recently entered into a number of agency agreements to market our product line in Mexico and the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”) region. We have also attended numerous tradeshows in an effort to re-establish HighCom’s presence in the personal protection equipment market and we are currently participating in numerous bids exceeding 25 million dollars. Management believes that we will experience significant increase in our overall sales on a quarter by quarter basis as we develop these relationships, although no assurances can be given in this regard.
 
U.S. Department/U.S. Defense Department. 
 
In March 2011, the Company secured export privileges from the U.S. State Department which dramatically improves HighCom’s ability to sell and market its products.
 
BlastGard has completed registration with both the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls as well as the Bureau of Industry and Security (“BSI”). The purpose of these registrations is to allow BlastGard control over the export management and compliance program moving forward. HighCom also completed their ISO certification which had been revoked due to missed audits. BlastGard management has been able to complete an internal audit and management review, in addition to meeting with BSI for the external audit review and in March 2012 HighCom secured ISO certification. One of the most important aspects of our business philosophy is an unparalleled commitment to quality control. HighCom is BA 9000 and ISO 9001:2008 certified organization, providing only the highest quality products to protect the lives of the men and women who proudly serve our country both locally and across the world. HighCom actually became the first company in the world to achieve BA 9000 certification, a new National Institute of Justice (NIJ) body armor quality management standard. BA 9000 is a body armor quality management systems standard that is an extension of ISO 9001 which provides greater confidence that the armor is being produced consistently.

Product Description
 
HighCom provides a wide range of security products and personal protective gear (including tactical armor) that are tailored and offer protection solutions to specific customer requirements. HighCom caters to local law enforcement agencies, correctional facilities and municipal authorities. Given the equipment and ballistic protection solutions provided by HighCom, compliance with the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of the Treasury and all other governmental agencies’ regulations is a high priority. HighCom has sold its products in the defense and law enforcement sectors and is known for innovative technology, exceptional customer service and superior quality performance.
 
Body armor is classified by the NIJ according to the level of protection it provides from various threats. The classifications are as follows:
 

● | Type IIA body armor- minimal protection against smaller caliber handgun threats. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Type II body armor – provides protection against many handgun threats, including many common smaller caliber pistols with standard pressure ammunition, and against many revolvers. 
● | Type IIIA body armor- provides a higher level of protection and will generally protect against most pistol calibers including many law enforcement ammunitions, and against many higher powered revolvers. 
● | Type III and IV body armor – provides protection against rifle rounds and are generally only used in tactical situations. 

 
Our Security Products include the following:
 

● | Striker ballistic helmets 
--+-------------------------------------------
● | Guardian hard armor plates 
● | Trooper soft armor vests 
● | Bellfire ballistic shields 
● | Civilian Armor System ballistic panels 
● | Stingray ballistic blanket 

 
Manufactured products versus products supplied by third party vendors.
 
HighCom manufactures ballistic plates, soft armor vests, ballistic shields and constructs ballistic helmets. Our HighCom products carry our brand name or a private label. Since October 2015, our ballistic vests and ballistic blankets are no longer manufactured and private labeled by third party vendors for us.
 
PLATES 
 
Level IV – NIJ 05
 
HighCom currently maintains some of the largest capability for manufacturing Level IV ceramic plates. An important strategic move we have employed is to partner with numerous companies to further leverage available equipment to increase production capacity. An example of this is utilizing press consolidation capacity to produce high pressure backings for plates.

-


The Level IV NIJ 05 plate has a very high margin of safety. Approximately 400 plates have been shot internally at HighCom’s ballistic lab and shooting range as well as at independent and other commercial labs. During these tests, no penetration has occurred when tested in accordance with the NIJ standard. Another important performance feature of this plate is that when used in conjunction with a Level IIIA Vest, this plate has established the ability to defeat six rounds, in accordance with Level III NIJ 05.
 
HighCom has fourteen different certifications of its Level IV plate utilizing different suppliers of ceramics and backing materials. We have deferred risk of material supply by securing qualified vendors to provide the necessary materials.
 
Level III – NIJ 05
 
HighCom has a Level III NIJ Polyethylene based plate solution with a production capacity of 20,000 units per month.
 
SAPI
 
The SAPI Plate (Small Arms Protective Insert) is used as an insert in military carriers. Due to the rate of ballistic performance and success we have established in the tests conducted thus far, we were able to achieve SAPI level performance with a weight of 100g less than the specification. Further, the HighCom sample defeated six rounds of explosive materials in a single plate. We have conducted impact drop tests and x-rays after shoot tests. This product needs additional testing and evaluation to solidify the results. We have spent $300,000 on SAPI development thus far applying the many lessons garnered during the past several years of research and development.
NIJ 06 Specification &Compliant Products
 
HighCom currently has three certified Level IV plates, five Level III plates, four Level IIIA vests and one Level II vest. There are additional tests in the pipeline along with a considerable number of options, solutions and directions for continued development of hard armor plates for certification under NIJ 0101.06 standards. As of the 1st quarter of 2017, HighCom’s Guardian Series Hard Armor™ product line now includes two new NIJ 0101.06 certified models, the Guardian 3S11™ and the Guardian 3S9™. Built to exceed industry standards at affordable prices, these inserts are designed according to the NIJ ratings for Level III, offering law enforcement and military personnel different options for up armor requirements whether concerned about armor piercing threats or high powered rifle threats. NIJ introduced the Ballistic Resistance of Body Armor NIJ Standard-0101.06 to more effectively defend against increased velocities of ammunition calibers and provide improved performance against the threats law enforcement faces in today’s world.
SHIELDS
 
HighCom produces a Level IIIA and a Level III ballistic shield that are among the most advanced in the market. This is due to the fact that the electrical connections are routed internally through the composite itself. Similar products offered in the marketplace will have external electrical connections. HighCom has a ballistic shield production capacity of approximately 800-1,000 units per month.
BLANKETS
 
We can produce ballistic blankets at any level to whatever size is needed by the end user. Production capability is approximately 500-800 units per month.
 
CIVILIAN ARMOR SYSTEMS
 
Launched in December 2013 after 18 months in development; HighCom is now offering a full line of Civilian Armor System (C.A.S.) products. Our civilian armor insert panels provide personal and professional defense against ballistic threats. HighCom inserts are designed, developed, and manufactured using state of the art processes and equipment to ensure high quality and high performance when deployed by operators throughout numerous tactical and urban situations. Our inserts are both internally and independently tested in accordance with the strictest criteria in adherence to the NIJ 0108.01 standard. We also perform additional testing against V50 and special threats.

-

SOFT ARMOR
 
HighCom has five certified soft armor products with a production capacity of 2,000 units per month. We were able to process a composite of proprietary material wherein ceramic materials are incorporated within the flexible composite. This alone increases ballistic stability, stab protection and provides further avenues towards lighter solutions. These lighter solutions in turn combine composite material into soft armor material. Research and testing at this stage is very preliminary with only basic testing conducted. However, results thus far strongly indicate to us that additional research in the vein has great potential for advantageous positioning in the soft armor sector of our industry. Additionally, we have cause to believe that analyzing bullet energy combining impact systems with both hard and soft ballistic systems will provide a superior product in this industry.
HELMETS
 
HighCom is working towards achieving a proprietary uni-directional material that a third party will lay up for us in tape form (100% Polyethylene). Based on previous research and testing conducted, management believes that we can produce a Level III helmet. We have yet to finish accomplishing the entire process. We will need to validate the date, produce an aluminum mold as well as the prototype once the material is completed by a third party. Management believes that this helmet will be an excellent “Made in USA” product that can be marketed internationally at a very competitive price point.
Research and Development
 
During fiscal 2016 and 2015, HighCom spent $52,586 and $43,189, respectively on research and development efforts. Future research and development expenses will depend upon our liquidity and capital resources.
 
MARKET DEFINITION
 
Industry Description and Outlook
 
There are over 17,000 law enforcement agencies in the U.S. with over 750,000 police officers. The law enforcement market is scattered across the country and is typically serviced by distributors which provide products such as body armor, uniforms, guns, and other items.
 
According to a Vector Strategy report, they have defined five overall market trends that will affect global body armor demand between now and 2020. Body armor has a life cycle of five years. This combined with an average 10% attrition rate in law enforcement, means that approximately 30% of body armor purchases are turned over each year. These trends will affect both the military and the paramilitary, or law enforcement, markets in countries throughout the world.
 
Next Generation Military Body Armor Programs
 
Many countries are developing next generation body armor systems to replace the body armor systems and components currently worn by the military ground forces in their country. Specific examples include the US Army’s Soldier Protection Systems (SPS), the UK’s Future Infantry Soldier Technology (FIST) program, France’s FELIN program, Germany’s Future Soldier System, Russia’s Future Soldier System, and the Israeli Advanced Soldier. As these programs move from development into Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), and then into Full Rate Production (FRP), military body armor procurement in these countries will experience an uptick in demand. These next generation body armor programs are currently in development and will primarily affect demand in the 2017 to 2020 timeframe. It is vital that these development programs are successfully executed in the next one to two years and that funding is allocated to support procurement in their respective country of origin.
The Next Generation Ripple Effect
 
As the United States and other leading countries develop and procure next generation body armor systems, other countries who are not developing their own next generation systems will seek to spiral in next generation technology developed by other countries. These countries tend to adapt US or European body armor technology or import US or European body armor components. These countries may also have the opportunity to procure body armor that incorporates military body armor technology that is currently restricted from export, but may become excluded from export restrictions in the future.

8
-


Vector Strategy labels this trend “The Next Generation Ripple Effect”. Our use of the word “ripple” denotes that this trend will occur 2 to 3 years after next generation systems are being procured in countries that organically developed those systems.
 
Warrior Cop
 
“Warrior Cop” refers to the increasing integration of tactical, SWAT, and special operations within the law enforcement environment. This has also been referred to as the trend towards “police militarization”. This trend will increase demand for body armor with higher protection levels and lower areal densities, and designs that provide more mobility and comfort, including helmets. “Warrior Cop” will affect body armor procurement in the United States, and in European countries with significant law enforcement organizations. Countries with a more paramilitary style of civilian law enforcement will be less affected by this trend. The “Warrior Cop” trend will primarily affect demand in 2017, with a lesser impact in 2018 to 2020.
Armored 1st Responders
 
In the United States and European countries, there is an increasing trend to provide body armor to first responders, such as EMS/EMT personnel and firefighters. This trend has been stimulated by the need to upgrade the capabilities of personnel who have to respond to casualties in the midst of a terrorist attack, mass shooting event, or other situation where the responder may encounter gunfire. Many body armor suppliers are offering specific ballistic vest designs as an upgrade to the normal vests that EMS/EMT and first responders typically wear. This demand driver will primarily affect body armor markets in the United States and western European countries. Vector Strategy believes that the global body armor market is just beginning to experience increased demand due to “Armored 1st Responders”.
Material and Technology Improvements
 
The market is experiencing the release of several fiber and Uni-Directional (UD) products that offer performance improvements, as well as hard plate material technologies that optimize weight, price, and protection. Major body armor manufacturers and material suppliers are co-branding new body armor components that incorporate these improvements. In addition, the soft body armor and helmet markets are both trending towards the hybrid use of fibers in their material solutions. These, and other near-term material and technology improvements will drive demand in both the military and law enforcement market segments, as globally, end users will seek to replace older body armor components with new solutions that offer lighter weight, better protection, and more comfort.
 
According to the July 2014 IBISWorld Industry Report on Body Armor Manufacturing in the US, “the Body Armor Manufacturing industry is expected to continue to decline over the next five years. The industry is highly reliant on demand from the US federal government and its decision to deploy troops in hostile environments. However, US troops continue to withdraw from Iraq and Afghanistan, thereby weakening demand for body armor from the federal government. Furthermore, federal funding for defense is expected to decrease over the next five years, while government consumption and investment is put toward other security devices. Recovery is expected to begin in the middle of the next five-year period due to developments in body armor products and growth in law enforcement agency markets. The industry is also developing better fitting armor for women and more efficient protective equipment in general. In addition, law enforcement agencies are looking to reduce injuries to officers on the job by purchasing more body armor. Overall, the industry is expected to decline at an average annual rate of 1.6% over the five years through 2019, to $676.7 million. International trade is also expected to play a larger role for the industry. High-value added US manufactured goods will remain in demand in foreign markets such as Canada. Consequently, the value of exports is projected to rise an annualized 4.3% to $48.2 million over the five years to 2019. Additionally, imports are forecast to grow at an average annual rate of 3.5% to about $19.0 million over the five-year period, accounting for a mere 2.9% of domestic demand.”

HIGHCOM’S MARKETING AND SALES STRATEGY
 
Strategy
 
Our objective is to be a global leader in the businesses of safety, security, and defense protection. We continually seek to enhance our existing products and to introduce new products to expand our market share or enter into new markets. Historically, the largest portion of our HighCom business resulted from the sale of ballistic plates, vests and helmets. We plan on expanding our business into multiple segments of the defense market. We are considering other products and services for other aspects of the safety, security and defense protection. We sell our products and services through a variety of distribution channels. Depending upon the product or service, our customers include distributors; federal, state, and municipal law enforcement agencies and officers; government and military agencies; businesses; retailers; and consumers. More specifically, the major customers of HighCom are:

● | Independent Distributors 
--+--------------------------------------
● | Department of Homeland Security 
● | Other Federal Government Agencies 
● | Local Police Departments 
● | Foreign entities 
● | United Nations 

 
The channels of distribution for HighCom are distributors, direct sales, and the Government Services Administration (GSA). Since HighCom is a GSA contract holder any federal government agency can buy from them without additional prior approval.
 
Target Market
 
The primary target markets are:
 

● | U.S. Department of Defense 
--+----------------------------------------
 | 1. | Army

 | 3. | Police 
● | United Nations peace keeping forces 

 
How do we market ourselves
 
Armor products - personal armor plates, ballistic shields and soft armor vests – have been designed, developed and certified by HighCom. NIJ certification is the barrier to entry/foundation to the US armor industry since without NIJ certification marketability/sales opportunities to domestic law enforcement are limited. While export sales are possible without NIJ, NIJ certification is increasingly becoming required for export sales. All other HighCom products are distributed under non-exclusive supplier arrangements. Our HighCom marketing strategy includes the following:
 

● | HighCom website 
--+-----------------------------------------------
● | Trade publications 
● | Defense industry news websites 
● | Trade Shows and Conferences 
● | GSA advantage and 
● | Bidding on federal government supply needs

Bidding on Governmental Projects
 
Bidding on governmental (federal, state, local) contracts normally requires you to apply for status as an approved vendor. Once your application is accepted – you are eligible to participate in bids. Vendor certifications have varied processes – some include/require submission of detailed financial data to qualify and be certified as a vendor. Our ISO certification is also a key factor in registration. Bids are submitted to a US agency – either through online sites, email or US Mail. For foreign sales – normally approached by agents (based in foreign companies) – who request quotes for supply of goods in their local markets. Agents generally operate on a non-exclusive basis, but HighCom has in the past granted limited exclusivity to certain agents either on project specific basis – or a specific country basis. On occasion, HighCom may contract directly with a foreign government to supply products on behalf of local agent. HighCom would then receive payment direct from government agency and pay a commission to local agent.
EXPORT COMPLIANCE POLICY
 
HighCom is required to comply with all laws and regulations surrounding U.S. export controls. Recent events have focused the U.S. government’s attention on the need for increased enforcement of such laws. Although the government has always enforced export laws and regulations, the level of intensity has risen in the past several years as concerns regarding national security and international terrorism have grown.
 
The United States government has various objectives when controlling exports. For instance, the U.S. has placed controls on the export of certain goods and technologies to prevent them from being used by the Armed Forces of other nations and thus threatening U.S. national security. The U.S. also uses export controls for purposes of economic sanctions against certain nations and groups hostile to the United States.
 
The U.S. government not only possesses a national security interest through its export controls but also has additional objectives. Export controls help protect items that may be in short supply domestically such as oil or gas. Additionally, the U.S. collects trade data that allows the government to track the trade balance, evaluate the effect of foreign trade on the domestic economy, and/or develop foreign policy decisions. The end result of all the U.S. government’s regulations and laws is that HighCom must be cognizant and comply with all export laws.
 
HighCom management is firmly committed to full and complete compliance with all U.S. export control laws, including among others, the Export Administration Regulations administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations administered by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls at the U.S. Department of State, and the various sanctions and embargo regulations administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Controls (OFAC) at the U.S. Department of the Treasury. While HighCom has always been committed to compliance with all U.S. export control laws and regulations, our desire to ensure that no violations occur is heightened by the events of September 11, 2001. All HighCom employees associated with activities that are subject to U.S. export controls take extra precautions to ensure that no violations occur. It is HighCom management’s policy that under no circumstances will exports made on behalf of its customers be made contrary to U.S. export laws and regulations. Special care is taken to prevent transactions with entities involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
 
Violations of the Export Administration Regulations could result in significant penalties for HighCom and for those individuals involved in the violation. Civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation may be imposed or up to $120,000 if the violation involves national security controls. Violations could also result in a denial of HighCom’s export privileges meaning it could no longer forward products to international customers. Criminal penalties may also be imposed on HighCom and on the individuals involved. For willful violations of the export regulations, HighCom could be fined up to $1,000,000 per violation and individuals could be fined up to $250,000 per violation and imprisoned for up to 20 years.

--


Violations of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations can also result in serious civil and criminal penalties for HighCom and the individuals involved. Civil penalties can reach $500,000 per violation; criminal penalties can reach $1,000,000 per violation. HighCom and individuals can also be debarred from practicing before the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, meaning the debarred party is ineligible to export defense articles from the U.S.
 
Violations of OFAC regulations can also be very expensive and even result in a denial of export privileges in addition to various civil and criminal penalties. The U.S. government takes export control violations very seriously and so does the management of HighCom.
 
HighCom has implemented an Export Compliance Program specifically designed to satisfy the requirements of the pertinent United States statutes, rules and regulations, such as the Export Administration Act, Trading with the Enemies Act, Arms Export Control Act, International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Export Administration Regulations, the Foreign Assets Control Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations, the Alcohol, the Customs Regulations, and all other applicable statutes, rules and regulations governing the export and transportation of commodities by HighCom. The Export Compliance Program includes training on compliance issues, the preparation and utilization of the U.S. Export Control Compliance Manual, and the establishment of a system of internal reviews designed to identify any risks of non-compliance by HighCom.
 
OVERVIEW OF U.S. EXPORT REGULATIONS
 
The principal government agencies that regulate U.S. exports are the Department of Commerce, which regulates the export of “dual-use” items, and the Department of State, which regulates the export of defense or “munitions” items. “Dual-use” items are commercial items (i.e., commodities, software and technology) that can also be used in military applications, while “defense articles,” “defense services,” and related technical data are items specifically designed, modified or adapted for military uses and that have limited or no commercial application. This information is based on regulations published by these two, as well as other relevant U.S. government agencies, and is subject to change. This information will be updated periodically to reflect changes made to the pertinent laws and regulations.
 
The Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) is the agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce that is responsible for administering export controls of “dual-use” items. BIS publishes and administers the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) (15 C.F.R. Part 730 et seq.) which describe export controls and contain a list of the commodities, software, and technology that are controlled for export by the Department of Commerce. This list is called the Commerce Control List, or “CCL”, and is contained in Supplement No.1 to Part 774 of the EAR.
 
The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (“DDTC”) is the agency within the U.S. Department of State that is responsible for administering controls on the temporary import, temporary export, and permanent export/re-export of “defense articles,” “defense services,” and related “technical data.” The Department of State administers the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) which contain the United States Munitions List (“USML”). The USML details the commodities, software, and technical data that are controlled by the State Department.
 
Whether an export is controlled by the Commerce Department or the State Department depends on the proper classification of the product. All exports are controlled by only one agency though it may in some cases be difficult to determine the appropriate agency jurisdiction. In such cases, exporters may file a commodity jurisdiction (“CJ”) request with DDTC to determine which agency has jurisdiction over the product, software, or technology. DDTC generally takes at least six months to respond to CJ requests, so their utility may be limited in a commercial context unless application is made sufficiently early.

Competition
 
We operate in intensely competitive markets that are characterized by competition from major domestic and international companies in our business and from a large number of competitive companies and alternative solutions in our security business. This intense competition could result in pricing pressures, lower sales, reduced margins, and lower market share. Any movement away from high-quality, domestic ballistic plates to lower priced or comparable foreign alternatives would adversely affect our business. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources and, in certain cases, may have lower cost structures than we possess and that may afford them competitive advantages. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of products, to negotiate lower prices on raw materials and components, to deliver competitive products at lower prices, and to introduce new products and respond to customer requirements more effectively and quickly than we can.
 
Competition is primarily based on quality of products, product innovation, price, consumer brand awareness, alternative solutions, and customer service and support. Pricing, product image, quality, and innovation are the dominant competitive factors in the industry. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, both within and outside our control. These factors include the following:
 

● | our success in designing and introducing innovative new products and services; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our ability to predict the evolving requirements and desires of our customers; 
● | the quality of our customer service; 
● | product and service introductions by our competitors; and 
● | foreign labor costs and currency fluctuations, which may cause a foreign competitor’s products to be priced significantly lower than our products. 

 
We can provide no assurances that we will be able to successfully compete with our competitors in the future.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company has fourteen full-time employees. The Company also relies on temporary workers for its manufacturing facility. Additional sales and marketing personnel may be hired in the future as our sales efforts require such additional personnel.
 
HighCom Sales
 
In 2016 and 2015, HighCom accounted for approximately 99% and 99%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated sales. It is anticipated that this trend will continue in the future as sales of BlastGard products described below are not expected to amount to a meaningful percentage of the Company’s sales activities.

BlastGard International, Inc.
 
BlastGard - Overview
 
Through BlastGard® Technologies, Inc., our wholly-owned Florida corporation, we have developed and designed proprietary blast mitigation materials. Our Patented BlastWrap® has been designed to mitigate blasts and suppress flash fires resulting from explosions, regardless of the material or compound causing the explosion. We believe that this technology can be used to create new finished products or designed to retrofit existing products.
 
BlastWrap® is a concept for assemblies (not a chemical compound) from which blast protection products are built to save lives and reduce damage to valuable assets from explosions. BlastWrap® is designed to not only substantially reduce blast impulse and pressure (including reflected pressure and impulse), but quenches fireballs and suppresses post-blast fires. Lethal fragments may be captured by adding anti-ballistic armor layers on the product surface away from a blast.
 
Our BlastGard® technology is designed to mitigate blast and rapid combustion phenomena through numerous mechanisms. The relative contribution of each mechanism depends upon the intensity and nature of the impinging hazard. Shock wave attenuation, for example, is dominant in mitigating mechanical explosions. Our products attempt to emulate unconfined conditions and accelerate attenuating processes that occur in free air. Thus BlastWrap® does not try to resist blasts (which physically intensify blast phenomena); it mitigates them. BlastWrap® can be used as part of confining assemblies (containers and blast walls). In effect, BlastWrap® is a ‘virtual vent’.
 
BlastWrap® Technology Components 
 
Our BlastWrap® products are made from two flexible films arranged one over the other and joined by a plurality of seams filled with attenuating filler material (volcanic glass bead or other suitable two-phase materials), configurable (designed for each application) with an extinguishing coating. Together, this combination of materials is designed to mitigate a blast while at the same time eliminate fireballs or flame fronts produced by the blast.
 
We believe that this system is unique because it:
 
1. Works 24 hours a day
 
2. Quenches fireballs and post blast fires
 
3. Reduces blast impulse and pressure
 
4. Does not dispense chemical extinguishants
 
5. Uses neither alarms, sensors, nor an activation system
 
6. Is nontoxic and ecologically friendly
 
Our BlastGard® Technology extracts heat, decelerates both blast wind and shock waves, and quenches the hot gases in all blasts and fireballs. BlastWrap® does not interact with the explosive elements, and is therefore not altered by them. However, after a single intense detonation, BlastWrap® must be replaced.
 

● | For blasts that produce fireballs or intense hot gases at higher pressures, BlastGard® Technology has the ability, through testing, to cool the blast zone rapidly, thereby reducing structural damage. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In detonation of high explosives, where at least half of the energy released is in the shock wave, attenuation occurs even more rapidly, and in doing so substantially reduces explosion phenomena.

● | Neither contains nor creates hazardous fragments 
● | Environmentally friendly, non-toxic core materials 

Key BlastWrap® Benefits 
 
BlastWrap® is light in weight. It can be used to protect against outdoor explosions. Because of the Montreal protocols banning production of Halon extinguishing agents, BlastWrap® technology offers a light weight and environmentally acceptable blast suppression means available for most applications; and, it can even be adapted to function underwater.
 
BlastWrap® products are inherent sound absorbers and thermal insulators, and are typically fire-tolerant. Any or all of these qualities are readily enhanced by bonding to common materials, thereby further extending the wide range of applications which BlastWrap® can fulfill through a single product.
 
The performance of BlastWrap® proprietary technology is independent of scenario and environment, which means that it does not matter where the physical location is, how the basic product form is used or the environment in which the event takes place. The basic product form can be used as a stand-alone material (as linings, curtain barriers, or as structural material), or can be laminated or otherwise affixed to a wide range of product forms such as insulation (thermal and acoustic), ballistic armor such as KEVLAR™ (a DuPont trademark), decorative stone, or packaging materials. BlastWrap® products can thus provide blast and fire protection in flooring, wall, and roof constructions, in packaging, in storage cabinets and other containment structures, and aboard all types of vehicles, ships, and aircraft.
 
Intellectual Property Rights 
 
Explosive devices are increasingly being used in asymmetric warfare to cause destruction to property and loss of life. These explosive devices sometimes can be disrupted, but often there is insufficient warning of an attack. Our BlastWrap® products were created around this core concept. The BlastWrap® patent application was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on July 31, 2003. A second patent application for “Blast mitigating container assemblies” was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on April 29, 2004 and a new U.S. Continuation-In-Part patent application for “Blast mitigating container assemblies” on January 26, 2005. We also filed an application for this “Blast mitigating container assemblies” technology under the Patent Cooperation Treaty on January 26, 2006.
 
On November 27, 2012, BlastGard was notified by its patent counsel that its patent application for its BlastWrap material was issued as U.S. Patent No. 8,316,752 B2. On March 18, 2008, our patent-pending application (No. 11/042,318) for our explosive effect mitigated containers (i.e. BlastGard MTR and MBR”) was issued as U.S. Patent No. 7,343,843.
 
BlastWrap® Testing 
 
BlastWrap® prototypes have been evaluated in different test series, which have ranged from semi-quantitative screenings to third-party instrumented trials. We have consistently observed blast effect reductions of at least 50% in virtually every activity in which BlastWrap® has been involved. These tests have indicated that impulse (momentum transfer) and peak pressure are reduced by nearly 50%. Impulse is the most destructive explosive-related hazard for structures and vehicles. We have also conducted further development design and testing of a series of products for blast mitigation protection of rapid deployment barriers, walls, revetments and bunkers (including overhead protection from inbound mortars) for the United States military.

Significance of Test Results 
 
No BlastWrap® tests have been in small-scale. Every test series has involved standard products or test facilities simulating service conditions—munitions containers, air cargo containers, steel vessels comparable in size to commercial aircraft fuel tanks and large secondary storage units, and vehicles, all with charge weights reflecting actual hazards. Management believes that the test results provide evidence that BlastWrap® can protect vehicles, structures, and ships against very intense blasts. Tests have also shown that certain design features (such as deflectors), combined with additional BlastWrap® material, can accomplish protection against larger blasts.
Government Awards
 
BlastWrap®, and its BlastGard® Mitigating Trash Receptacles were designated as Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technologies and placed on the “Approved Products List for Homeland Security.” We were issued the “Designation” and “Certification” for our technology by the Department of Homeland Security under the Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 (the SAFETY ACT) in July of 2006. In the 4th quarter of 2011, the designation and certification was extended for another five years to our BlastWrap product but excluded our BlastGard MTR receptacles until we provide new test data that conforms to new ASTM standards. No further testing has been planned at this time. The revisions allow the use of liners and lids which the original standards did not address. The lid and liner materials must be tested to certain ASTM plastic standards. In the 4th quarter of 2016, the designation and certification was extended for another five years to our BlastWrap product.
 
The SAFETY ACT “Designation” and “Certification“ are intended to support effective technologies aimed at preventing, detecting, identifying, or deterring acts of terrorism, or limiting the harm that such acts might otherwise cause. The criteria technologies must meet to be awarded “Designation” and “Certification” status include: the availability of the technology for immediate deployment in public and private settings; the magnitude of risk exposure to the public if the technology is not deployed; the evaluation of scientific studies being feasibly conducted to assess the technology’s capability to substantially reduce risks of harm; and the technology’s effectiveness in facilitating the defense against acts of terrorism. BlastWrap is designed to mitigate the blast effects of an explosion by rapidly extinguishing the fireball, eliminating burns and post-blast fires, and reducing the subsequent overpressures by more than 50%, thus reducing damage to people and property.
 
The SAFETY ACT legislation was designed to encourage the development and rapid deployment of life-saving antiterrorism technologies by providing manufacturers or sellers with limited risk to legal liability. It was also designed to harness the nation’s scientific and technological resources to provide federal, state, and local officials with the technology and capabilities to protect the United States from terrorist acts. One area of focus for the Department of Homeland Security is catastrophic terrorist threats to the nation’s security that could result in large-scale loss of life and major economic impact. The SAFETY ACT fosters research of technologies to counter threats both by evolutionary improvements to current capabilities and development of revolutionary, new capabilities.

Manufacturing and Product Line
 
We are currently manufacturing our core product, BlastWrap®, for sale in various forms. We have three distinct production types:
 

● | Serial Production – items that can be produced in quantity in an efficient, high-speed assembly line fashion. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Contract Manufacturing – items that require special design or custom features requiring separate and special manufacturing processes. 
● | OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) Production – items that are licensed to OEM manufacturers enabling greater control over design, quality and production requirements specific to their industry. 

 
The primary application for BlastWrap® is as an intermediate good for numerous civilian and military applications and uses. Our technology can be customized for specific industries and applications. We have examined the various markets where explosions occur, selected targeted applications and focused on development of products for those businesses and agencies at risk. While designing finished products engineered with BlastWrap®, we have taken into account that some products must be portable, while others will remain at a fixed location. Some products have been designed to contain identified explosive agents, while others are designed to mitigate unidentified explosive threats. With these standards in mind, we have developed or are developing the following product lines to address the needs of customers and targeted markets:
 

● | Mitigated Bomb Receptacles and MBR Gard Cart; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------
● | Blast Mitigated Unit Load Device (“BMULD”) – LD3 Container; 
● | Insensitive Munitions (IM) Weapons Container; 
● | Mitigated Trash Receptacle; and 
● | BlastGard Barrier System (“BBS”). 

 
Since our Company’s acquisition of our subsidiary, HighCom, we have devoted substantially all of our resources toward the development of HighCom’s business. For fiscal 2016, our BlastWrap® product sales totaled approximately $121,394.
 
Purchasing 
 
We rely on various suppliers to furnish the raw materials and components used in the manufacturing of our products. Management believes that there are numerous alternative suppliers for all of the key raw material and virtually all component needs.
Governmental Regulation 
 
We are not aware of any existing or probable governmental regulations that would affect our business, except to the extent that we voluntarily design products to meet various governmental guidelines. For example, our products can be designed to conform to the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearm’s requirements for the containment of explosive materials.
Research and Development 
 
In 2016 and 2015, we spent $940 and $2,843 respectively on research and development of BlastWrap® products.
 
SEC Reports Available on Website
 
The SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other SEC filings are available on the SEC’s website as well as our company website at www.blastgardintl.com.

Item 1.A Risk Factors
 
An investment in our common stock involves major risks. Before you invest in our common stock, you should be aware that there are various risks, including those described below. You should carefully consider these risk factors together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K before you decide to purchase shares of our common stock.
 
Purchase of our stock is a highly speculative and there can be no assurances that our operations will be profitable. We have been operating at a profit since 2014. Prior to 2014, we had been operating at a loss since inception and we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $9 million. At December 31, 2016, we have shareholder equity of approximately $9,666,530 as compared to shareholder equity of approximately $3,114,000 at December 31, 2015. While we had an operating income of approximately $675,000 for 2016 on sales of over $7.9 million, we can provide no assurances that our future operations will be profitable. Accordingly, investors who own shares of our Common Stock could lose their entire investment.
 
Although we had a working capital surplus of approximately $2,100,000 at December 31, 2016, there can be no assurances that we will be able to meet our obligations as they become due and payable. At December 31, 2016, we had a working capital surplus of approximately $2,100,000 in contrast to a working capital surplus of approximately $1,043,000 at December 31, 2015. While Management is projecting continuous increased sales in 2017 as compared to the comparable period of the prior year and the expectation is that we will be able to meet our obligations as they become due and payable, we can provide no assurances that we will be successful in this regard.
 
Controlling Interest. As set forth in Item 12, one corporation beneficially owns 200,528,362 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, equivalent to approximately 55% of the Company’s outstanding shares. We cannot predict what changes will be instituted by our controlling stockholder in the Company’s management and/or directors and in the direction of the Company.
 
Business and Operational Risks 
 
The following are the major business and operational risks related to our new HighCom subsidiary:
 

● | We must comply with all laws and regulations surrounding U.S. export controls. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Continued turmoil in the credit markets and the financial services industry may negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
● | Many of our customers have fluctuating budgets, which may cause fluctuations in our results of operations. 
● | Our business is subject to various laws and regulations favoring the U.S. government’s contractual position, and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm operating results and prospects. 
● | We rely on certain vendors to supply us with ballistics materials, composites materials, and other key materials that if we were unable to obtain could adversely affect our business. 
● | Growth of operations may strain resources and if we fail to manage growth successfully, our business could be adversely affected. 
● | Increases in the prices paid for raw materials or labor costs may adversely affect profit margins. 


18
--


● | Our products are used in situations that are inherently risky. Accordingly, we may face product liability and exposure to other claims for which we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We are engaged in a highly competitive marketplace, which demands that producers continue to develop new products. Our business will be adversely affected if we are not able to continue to develop new and competitive products. 
● | We face continuous pricing pressure from our customers and our competitors. This will affect our margins and therefore our profitability and cash flow unless we can efficiently manage our manufacturing costs and market our products based on superior quality. 
● | We may have difficulty protecting our proprietary technology. 
● | If we are unable to successfully retain executive leadership and other key personnel, our ability to successfully develop and market our products and operate our business may be harmed. 
● | We have launched and expect to continue to launch strategic and operational initiatives which if not successful could adversely affect our business. 
● | We may incur additional costs or material shortages due to new NIJ certification and testing standards. 
● | If internal controls over financial reporting are ineffective, our business and future prospects may suffer. 

 
HighCom faces intense competition that could result in our losing or failing to gain market share and suffering reduced revenue.
 
HighCom operates in intensely competitive markets that are characterized by competition from major domestic and international companies in our business and from a large number of competitive companies and alternative solutions in our security business. This intense competition could result in pricing pressures, lower sales, reduced margins, and lower market share. Any movement away from high-quality, domestic ballistic plates to lower priced or comparable foreign alternatives would adversely affect our business. Some of HighCom’s competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources and, in certain cases, may have lower cost structures than we possess and that may afford them competitive advantages. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of products, to negotiate lower prices on raw materials and components, to deliver competitive products at lower prices, and to introduce new products and respond to customer requirements more effectively and quickly than HighCom can.
 
Competition is primarily based on quality of products, product innovation, price, consumer brand awareness, alternative solutions, and customer service and support. Pricing, product image, quality, and innovation are the dominant competitive factors in the industry. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, both within and outside our control. These factors include the following:
 

● | our success in designing and introducing innovative new products and services; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our ability to predict the evolving requirements and desires of our customers; 
● | the quality of our customer service; 
● | product and service introductions by our competitors; and 
● | foreign labor costs and currency fluctuations, which may cause a foreign competitor’s products to be priced significantly lower than our products.

We can provide no assurances that we will be able to successfully compete with our competitors in the future.
 
If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, we will not be successful generating revenues or attaining profits. The personal body armor industry is highly competitive. Our ability to generate revenues and profitability is directly related to our ability to compete with our competitors. Currently, we believe that we have a competitive advantage because of our unique technology, our product performance, product mix and price. Our beliefs are based only on our research and development testing. We face competition in our markets from competing technologies and direct competition from additional companies that may enter this market with greater financial resources than we have. If we are unable to compete effectively, we will not be successful in generating revenues or attaining profits.
 
Loss of key personnel could cause a major disruption in our day-to-day operations and we could lose our relationships with third-parties with whom we do business. Our future success depends in a significant part upon the continued service of our executive officers as key management personnel. Competition for such personnel may be intense, and to be successful we must retain our key managerial personnel. The loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified replacement personnel could cause a major disruption in our day-to-day operations and we could lose our relationships with third-parties with whom we do business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 
We are primarily dependent upon the sales activities of HighCom. Currently, the Company is devoting primarily all of its manpower and capital resources to the operations of HighCom, which accounts for substantially all of our sales activities. If our parent corporation, BlastGard, chooses to devote resources toward the development of sales in its traditional BlastWrap business, these sales activities may not be successful. We can provide no assurances that our operations will be able to operate profitably in the future.
 
Dependence on outside manufacturers and suppliers could disrupt our business if they fail to meet our expectations. Currently, we rely on outside manufacturers and suppliers for some of our products. In the event that any of our suppliers or manufacturers should become too expensive or suffer from quality control problems or financial difficulties, we would have to find alternative sources.
 
Possible technological obsolescence of our products. Our products may be subject to technological obsolescence, which would adversely affect our business by increasing our research and development costs and reducing our ability to generate sales. Discovery of another new technology by third parties could replace or result in lower than anticipated demand for our products and could materially adversely affect our operations.
 
We may not be able to successfully use or defend our intellectual property rights, which would prevent us from developing an advantage over our competitors. We rely on a combination of patent applications, trademarks, copyright and trade secret laws, and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights, which we believe will give us a competitive advantage over our competitors. Even if a patent is issued, use of our technology may infringe upon patents issued to third-parties, which would subject us to the cost of defending the patent and possibly requiring us to stop using the technology or to license it from a third party. If a third party infringes on a patent issued to us, we will bear the cost of enforcing the patent. If we are not able to successfully use or defend our intellectual property rights, we may not be able to develop an advantage over our competitors.
 
We do not expect to be able to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, so you should not make an investment in our stock if you require dividend income. The payment of cash dividends, if any, in the future rests within the discretion of its Board of Directors and will depend, among other things, upon our earnings, our capital requirements and our financial condition, as well as other relevant factors. We have not paid or declared any cash dividends upon our Common Stock since our inception and by reason of our present financial status and our contemplated future financial requirements does not contemplate or anticipate making any cash distributions upon our Common Stock in the foreseeable future.

We have a limited market for our common stock which causes the market price to be volatile and to usually decline when there is more selling than buying on any given day. Our common stock currently trades on the OTC Pink® marketplace under the symbol “BLGA.” However, at most times in the past, our common stock has been thinly traded and as a result the market price usually declines when there is more selling than buying on any given day. As a result, the market price has been volatile, and the market price may decline immediately if you decide to place an order to sell your shares.
 
The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and several factors that are beyond our control, including our common stock being historically thinly traded, could adversely affect its market price. Our common stock has been historically thinly traded and the market price has been highly volatile. For these and other reasons, our stock price is subject to significant volatility and will likely be adversely affected if our revenues or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community’s expectations. Additionally, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to:
 

● | announcements of new products or sales offered by BlastGard® or its competitors; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results; 
● | changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; 
● | changes in the market’s perception of us or the nature of our business; and 
● | sales of our common stock. 

 
Future sales of common stock into the public market place will increase the public float and may adversely affect the market price. As of March 16, 2017, we had outstanding 366,976,178 shares of common stock, including an estimated 166,447,816 outstanding shares held by non-affiliated persons. Holders of restrictive securities may also sell their restrictive shares pursuant to Rule 144. In general, under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, shares of our common stock beneficially owned by a person for at least six months (as defined in Rule 144) are eligible for resale under Rule 144, subject to the availability of current public information about us and, in the case of affiliated persons, subject to certain additional volume limitations, manner of sale provisions and notice provisions. Pursuant to Rule 144, non-affiliates may sell or otherwise transfer their restricted shares without compliance with current public information where the restricted securities have been held for at least one year pursuant to Rule 144(a). Future sales of common stock or the availability of common stock for sale may have an adverse effect on the market price of our thinly traded common stock, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to obtain future funding as well as create a potential market overhang.
 
“Penny Stock” regulations may adversely affect your ability to resell your stock in market transactions. The SEC has adopted penny stock regulations which apply to securities traded over-the-counter. These regulations generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an equity security of an issuer with net tangible assets of less than $5,000,000 as indicated in audited financial statements, if the corporation has been in continuous operations for less than three years. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the rules for any transaction involving a penny stock require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC that contains certain information describing the nature and level of risk associated with investments in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Monthly account statements must be sent by the broker-dealer disclosing the estimated market value of each penny stock held in the account or indicating that the estimated market value cannot be determined because of the unavailability of firm quotes. In addition, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors (generally institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000). These practices require that, prior to the purchase, the broker-dealer determined that transactions in penny stocks were suitable for the purchaser and obtained the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction.
 
Our common stock is currently subject to the penny stock regulations. Compliance with the penny stock regulations by broker-dealers will likely result in price fluctuations and the lack of a liquid market for the common stock, and may make it difficult for you to resell your stock in market transactions.
