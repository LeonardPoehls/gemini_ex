We maintain a website at www.bobevansgrocery.com. We make available free of charge through our website our periodic and other reports filed with or furnished to the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Information on our website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC.
The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information contained in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Background
We are a leading producer and distributor of a variety of home-style refrigerated side-dishes, premium pork sausage and frozen food items primarily under the Bob Evans, Owens and Country Creek brand names as well as the Pineland Farms brand name subsequent to our acquisition of the Pineland Farms Potato Company on May 1, 2017. Our food products are distributed to retail customers throughout the United States. Additionally, we manufacture and sell similar products to foodservice customers, including Bob Evans Restaurants and other restaurants and food sellers. Prior to the sale of our restaurant business on April 28, 2017, we also owned and operated 523 Bob Evans Restaurants in 18 states.
Our business started in 1948 when our founder began making sausage on his southeastern Ohio farm to serve at his 12-stool, 24-hour diner. Our business grew from there and was incorporated in Ohio in 1957. We became a publicly traded company on June 6, 1963. Our current parent company was incorporated in Delaware on November 4, 1985. 
Major changes to continuing operations of the business as operated today include: 

• | In 1987, we expanded our business by acquiring Owens Country Sausage, Inc.


• | In 1991, we established the Bob Evans foodservice division, which sold food products directly to distributors and institutions.


• | In 1997, we began selling refrigerated side-dish products to our grocery customers.


• | In 2003, Owens Country Sausage purchased a food production plant in Sulphur Springs, Texas and began major renovations.


• | Beginning in 2009, as part of a network optimization program, we eliminated direct store deliveries and began shipping products directly to customer warehouses. As part of this program, in 2010 we closed our fresh sausage plant in Galva, Illinois, and also formed BEF Management, Inc. to act as a management company. In 2011, we sold our distribution center in Springfield, Ohio. We also completed a restructuring of the foods segment by creating BEF Foods, Inc., which consolidated all food production and operations under one company. 


• | In 2012, we purchased a 100,000 square foot food production facility in Lima, Ohio, where we primarily produce potato and pasta-based refrigerated side-dish products.


• | In 2013, we closed our fresh sausage plant in Richardson, Texas and our production facility in Bidwell, Ohio. We also began the first phase of an expansion at our Lima, Ohio, production facility and began an expansion at the Sulphur Springs, Texas, production facility.


• | In October 2013, we moved into our new corporate headquarters in New Albany, Ohio.


• | In 2014, we closed our production facility in Springfield, Ohio and also completed the expansions at the Lima, Ohio, and Sulphur Springs, Texas production facilities.


• | In October 2015, we entered into a sale leaseback transaction on our Lima, Ohio, and Sulphur Springs, Texas, production facilities. The lease agreement includes an initial 20-year term and two ten-year renewal options. 

5


• | In August 2016, we completed a fourth production line at the Lima, Ohio, plant.


• | In April 2017, we completed the sale of the Bob Evans Restaurants business as well as our corporate headquarters to affiliates of Golden Gate Capital Opportunity Fund, L.P. and completely divested from the restaurant segment.


• | In May 2017, we completed the acquisition of Pineland Farms Potato Company, a Maine corporation with assets that include a state-of-the-art potato processing facility and a 900-acre potato farm.

Our Business
We are a leading producer and distributor of home-style refrigerated side-dishes, pork sausage products and a variety of complimentary frozen food items. We offer a variety of quality, wholesome food products to retail and foodservice customers. We sell our retail food products under the Bob Evans, Owens, Country Creek and Pineland brand names, and selectively manufacture products for our retail customers' own private-label brand names. Our food products provide “farm-fresh goodness” and convenient meal solutions that uphold our commitment to premium quality. Our food products include over 100 complementary, convenience food items in the refrigerated and frozen areas of grocery stores such as mashed potatoes (different varieties in various sizes), diced and shredded breakfast potatoes, our Oven Bake Scalloped Potatoes, Oven Bake Macaroni & Cheese, Oven Bake Double Cheddar Pasta with Applewood Smoked Bacon and Oven Bake Southwest, our sides such as Homestyle Broccoli & Cheese, Seasoned Homestyle Stuffing, Six Cheese Pasta and Sliced Glazed Apples, our handheld breakfast items such as Bob Evans Sausage, Egg & Cheese Biscuits, Bob Evans Sausage Biscuits, Egg & Cheese Croissant, our Breakfast Burritos, Breakfast Bowls and Owens Kolaches, as well as our Soups (Original Chicken & Noodles and Original Sausage Chili), and Sausage Gravies. We also offer approximately 60 varieties of branded fresh, smoked and fully cooked pork and turkey sausage, ham and hickory-smoked bacon products. Varieties include Bob Evans Fresh Sausage (in rolls, patties or links), Bob Evans Sausage (including Italian, Savory Sage, Maple, as well as Naturally!), Bob Evans Fully Cooked Original Links and Fully Cooked Original Patties, Maple Links, Bob Evans Fully Cooked Turkey Sausage Patties or Fully Cooked Turkey Sausage Links, and Bob Evans Grilling Sausage (Original Bratwurst, Beer Bratwurst, Sweet Italian and Hot Italian). 
Our Strategy 
We believe every initiative, investment and expenditure the Company undertakes must not only deliver an acceptable financial return; it must also support and empower our team members to execute our brand promise:  high quality food delivered consistently to our retailers and food service customers.  Quality and customer service are hallmarks of the Bob Evans brand that will allow us to drive continued profitable sales growth. Our strategy for growth focuses on five key growth drivers, including:

• | increasing overall household penetration of the refrigerated side-dish market from 20% utilization, by 3-4x;


• | expanding SKU penetration at current retail customers


• | achieving new retail distribution including non-traditional grocery retailers such as food clubs and convenience stores;


• | expansion of our food service channel; and


• | continued product innovation including additional opportunities in vegetables, rice and pasta side-dish varieties.

Our refrigerated mashed potatoes and pasta side-dishes continue to grow as a percentage of our food products volume. Side-dish products comprise 58% of our current sales volumes, up from 36% in 2010, and will continue to grow as a percentage of our total volumes with the recent acquisition of Pineland Farms Potato Company. 
We will also continue to review our Selling, General and Administrative expenses ("S,G&A") and other cost structures to identify sustainable cost savings. 
Our vision for the Company is to be the grocery products brand of choice for consumers, a desirable and engaging employer for current and prospective talent, a valued partner in the community and a sound investment for shareholders. With the successful execution of our business objectives and business strategy, we believe we will achieve our vision. 
Restaurants Business Divestiture
On April 28, 2017, we completed the sale of our Bob Evans Restaurants business ("Restaurants Business") to Bob Evans Restaurants, LLC (formerly BER Acquisition, LLC), a Delaware limited liability company formed by affiliates of Golden Gate Capital Opportunity Fund, L.P. (the “Buyer”). The Buyer purchased the assets associated with our Restaurants Business, as well 
6

as our corporate headquarters for an aggregate purchase price of $565.0 million in cash, before certain adjustments set forth in the Asset and Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the "BER Sale Agreement"), for net proceeds of $539.3 million. As part of the transaction we also conveyed to the Buyer the majority of working capital liabilities associated with the Restaurants Business, including outstanding payables, accrued wages, and other accrued current liabilities, other than debt. We expect net proceeds, after tax payments, of $487.0 to $493.0 million. We used a portion of the proceeds to repay all outstanding borrowings under our $650.0 million Revolving and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") on April 28, 2017. On May 1, 2017, our Board of Directors also declared a special dividend of approximately $150.0 million (or $7.50 per share) representing the majority of the net cash proceeds from the sale of the Restaurants Business after income tax payments and the settlement of outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement, to be paid on June 16, 2017, to existing shareholders of record on May 30, 2017.
Recent Acquisition
On May 1, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Pineland Farms Potato Company, Inc., a Maine corporation (“PFPC”). We acquired all of the equity interests of PFPC in exchange for (i) $115.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the purchase agreement, and (ii) up to an additional $25.0 million in cash as potential earn-out consideration, the payment of which is subject to the achievement of certain operating EBITDA performance milestones over consecutive twelve-month periods during the 24 months following the closing. 
The Acquisition increases our side-dish production capacity and provides us the capability to produce and sell diced and shredded potato products in both the retail and food service channels. The acquisition also diversifies our production capability by adding a second state-of-the-art potato processing facility with approximately 180 million pounds of capacity. PFPC also owns and operates a 900-acre potato farm and is surrounded an estimated 55,000 acres of annual potato production. The production facility's close proximity to this potato production is anticipated to reduce transportation costs. The Acquisition will also mitigate the required near term capital spending for additional capacity to meet our expected sales growth targets in side-dish products.
Production Capacity
We produce food products in five manufacturing facilities. We produce fresh sausage products at our production facilities located in Hillsdale, Michigan and Xenia, Ohio. Ready-to-eat products, such as sandwiches, soups and gravies, are produced at our Sulphur Springs, Texas plant. Our Lima, Ohio, and newly acquired Mars Hill, Maine plants produce refrigerated side-dishes. In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed an additional $20.0 million expansion in production capacity to add a fourth side-dish production line at the Lima, Ohio, plant. This production line provides an additional 45 million pounds of annual side-dish production capacity. In May of 2017, we completed the acquisition of PFPC. Adding PFPC’s state-of-the-art production facility adds approximately 180 million pounds of production capacity to our plant network. 
We strive to be the best at operations execution by always focusing on food safety. We follow a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (“HACCP”) program at each of our manufacturing plants. HACCP is a comprehensive system developed in conjunction with government agencies to prevent food safety problems by addressing physical, chemical and biological hazards. We use HACCP to identify potential safety hazards so that key actions can be taken to reduce or eliminate risks during production. We also have a team dedicated to food safety and quality assurance. We also follow the British Retail Consortium global food safety initiatives to help ensure food safety and quality standards are practiced in our manufacturing facilities, as well as in the third party facilities that supply us.
We contract with third parties to manufacture or “co-pack” some of the Bob Evans and Owens products that are not produced in our own facilities or to supplement production during peak demand periods. These co-packed items include some of our side-dish and meat items. We used approximately 20 third parties to manufacture food products for us in fiscal 2017, representing approximately 17% of pounds produced.
Sales
The U.S. food industry has experienced significant consolidation over the last 20 years as competitors have shed non-core businesses and made strategic acquisitions to complement category positions, maximize economies of scale in raw material sourcing and production, and expand retail distribution. This consolidation is expected to continue. The importance of sustaining strong relationships with retailers has become a critical success factor for food companies because it drives category management and continuous replenishment programs. Food companies with category leadership positions and strong retail relationships have increasingly benefited from these initiatives as a way to maintain shelf space and maximize distribution efficiencies.
7

Bob Evans maintains a greater than 50% share of the national refrigerated dinner side-dish market and our refrigerated side-dish products are available in 75% of domestic retail grocery stores. Bob Evans branded mashed potatoes is the leading retail brand of refrigerated side-dish product in the United States and has been since 2007. Bob Evans sausage products also continue to have the largest market share in our core Midwest market. Our goal is to consistently drive sales growth by leveraging our strong market-share position to secure additional retail store business and gain additional market penetration. We also believe strong brand awareness is critical in maintaining and securing valuable retail shelf space and provides a strong platform for introducing product line extensions and new products.
A relatively small number of customers account for a large percentage of our sales. In fiscal 2017, Wal-mart Stores Inc. accounted for 20% of food product sales, while The Kroger Co. accounted for 14% of food product sales. We use national account teams to address the needs of our key retailers on a long-term basis.
Our retail sales force, which consists of our national account teams as well as third-party food brokers, sells our food products to the leading national and regional retail chains. Retail sales are approximately 85% of net sales, while foodservice sales account for approximately 15% of net sales. Items sold to our foodservice customers include sausage, sausage gravy, breakfast sandwiches and side-dishes. Sales to Bob Evans Restaurants (intercompany sales eliminated in consolidation in fiscal 2017) comprised approximately 40% of our food service sales in fiscal 2017. As part of the sale of our Restaurants Business, we entered into a five-year supply agreement with Bob Evans Restaurants. The supply agreement requires Bob Evans Restaurants purchase 100% of certain food products from the Company in the first year. The required percentage of purchases for those products then decreases annually, down to a required minimum of 25% in the final year of the supply agreement. 
Foodservice sales provide us with incremental volume in our production plants to leverage operating efficiencies. With the additional capacity provided by the acquisition of PFPC, we expect significant expansion in our food service product line, which accounts for approximately 80% of PFPC's sales. We believe foodservice sales may grow to approximately 40% of total volumes by fiscal 2020 as we work to obtain new customers. Expanding our foodservice customer base will help to maximize the utilization at our production plants and decrease the overhead cost burden on our retail products. 
Distribution
We supply our customers by shipping products directly to their warehouses for further distribution by the customers to their retail stores. We also distribute our products through food wholesalers and distributors who primarily service smaller, independent grocers and distribute to restaurant and food service operators.
At the end of fiscal 2017, Bob Evans or Owens brand products were available for purchase in grocery stores in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Our Owens brand products were available for purchase primarily in Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas.
We continue to work with retailers in states where there is an opportunity to distribute our products and explore expansion prospects to profitably increase points of distribution. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
One of the most important raw materials used in our food products business is live sows (an adult female pig), which we depend upon to produce our pork sausage products. We produce sausage using the same premium ingredients that Bob Evans used when he started the Company. Sow meat is a high-value product compared to other types of pig meat because it has a better texture when made into sausage.
We procure live sows at prevailing market prices from terminals, local auctions, country markets and corporate and family farms in various U.S. locations. The live sow market is volatile in terms of the number of sows available and market price. The live sow market is also dependent upon supply and demand for pork products, as well as corn and soybean meal prices (the major food supply for sows), weather and farmers’ access to capital. We procure sows in a variety of ways, including through supply contracts. Due to the structure of the sow market however, including the limited availability of sows, there is generally not a way to “lock” in prices contractually in advance for sows nor any commercially feasible, financial hedging products for sow prices to “fix” prices in advance, unlike the financial hedging products that are available for “lean hogs” or “pork bellies” prices. 
In fiscal 2017, larger herd sizes as well as capacity expansion including new butcher hog processing plants, drove sow costs lower than the prior year. We expect sow prices in fiscal 2018 to be modestly higher than fiscal 2017 as the breeding herd stabilizes and prices fluctuate on the normal seasonal pattern.
Other important raw materials used in our food products operations are potatoes, dairy products, seasonings and packaging materials. Historically, these materials have been readily available, although some items may be in short supply 
8

during certain seasons and prices fluctuate according to availability. Such shortages did not have a material impact on net sales or operating income in fiscal 2017. Generally, we purchase these items under supply contracts with periodic pricing reviews with our suppliers. We occasionally engage in commitments for certain commodity based items when market conditions indicate that taking a future position will have a favorable financial impact. We believe that these items will continue to be available from our existing suppliers or, upon short notice, can be obtained from other qualified suppliers. 
With the recent acquisition of PFPC, we acquired a 900-acre potato farm in Maine that vertically integrates less than 5% of our potato supply, but more importantly provides us with information regarding the cost of growing, harvesting and storing potatoes. This information allows us to purchase with greater efficiency and credibility with potato growers. The newly acquired facility is also surrounded by more than 55,000 acres of annual potato production. 
Most of our food products are perishable and require proper refrigeration. Product shelf life ranges from 18 to 60 days for refrigerated products. Due to the perishable nature and shelf life of these items, our production plants normally process only enough products to fill existing orders; however we do build inventory seasonally in-line with peak periods of customer demand. As a result, we maintain minimal inventory levels. Many of our breakfast and dinner sausage items can be frozen for shipping to warehouses. Shipping frozen product allows our retailers added flexibility to slack-out product as needed to meet consumer demand and allows us to build inventory for heavy consumption periods.
Advertising and Marketing
During fiscal 2017, we spent approximately $9.0 million advertising our food products, excluding coupons and trade promotion marketing costs. Our food products marketing programs consist of advertising, consumer promotions and trade promotions. Our advertising activities include television, newspaper and digital advertising aimed at increasing brand awareness and building consumer loyalty. Consumer promotions include the distribution of recipes featuring our products and targeted coupons designed to attract new customers and increase the frequency of purchases. Our trade promotions are aimed at providing retail display support, price discounts and securing additional shelf space. Trade promotions and discounts, which are recorded as a reduction to net sales, were $84.8 million, $79.3 million and $56.6 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A decline in sow costs as compared to the last year drove the increase in fiscal 2017 trade promotions and discounts, allowing us to remain price competitive in a low sow cost environment. Trade incentives are generally more prevalent for fresh sausage than for refrigerated sides and represented approximately 64%, 62% and 53% of total trade incentives in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Competition
The food products business is highly competitive and is affected by changes in the public’s eating habits and preferences, as well as by local and national economic conditions affecting consumer spending habits, many of which are beyond our control. Key competitive factors in the industry are the quality, flavor and value of the food products offered, advertising and name brand awareness. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. Our competitors include well-established national, regional and local producers and wholesalers of similar products, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. We also face growing competition from private label sausage products and side-dishes. 
Seasonality and Quarterly Results
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations because third and fourth quarter sales are typically higher due to increased sales of sausage and our home-style side-dishes during the colder months from November through April and especially during the holiday season. 
Our quarterly results can be significantly impacted by the cost and availability of raw materials, especially live sows. As a result, our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.
Trademarks and Service Marks
We believe that brand awareness is a significant component in a consumer’s decision to purchase one product over another in highly competitive consumer products industries. In most cases, our brand, slogans, and product line names are protected by trademark applications or registrations in the United States and certain other foreign countries (“Trademarks”).  While some of the Trademarks are exclusively owned by us, the majority of the Trademarks used in connection with our business were contributed in conjunction with the sale of our Restaurants Business to an entity that we control jointly with affiliates of Golden Gate Capital (“IPCo”).  The sale of our Restaurants Business assets included the sale of fifty percent of the equity interests in a newly formed special purpose entity that holds specified intellectual property assets used by both the Restaurants Business and the Company’s food production business. As a result of this contribution, IPCo is the legal owner of 
9

the Trademarks and certain other intellectual property contributed to IPCo, and we have a license to use the Trademarks and other intellectual property held by IPCo in connection with our business.  Certain restrictions set forth in our agreement with IPCo may limit our ability to expand use of the Trademarks into certain lines of business in which we do not currently operate.
Our web content and the domain names, including www.bobevansgrocery.com, and www.owensfoods.com are owned by us and the content is copyright protected. We also rely on unpatented proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations, continuing innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. 
We believe that our trademarks, service marks, websites, proprietary recipes and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brand-building efforts and marketing. We have vigorously protected our proprietary rights in the past and expect to continue to do so. We cannot predict, however, whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights or the use by others. It may be possible for unauthorized parties to copy, obtain or use certain portions of our food products or trademarks. Such unauthorized use could reduce the value of our products and brands, or have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.
Government Regulation
We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws affecting our businesses. However, we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable governmental regulations and, to date, we have not experienced abnormal difficulties or delays in obtaining the licenses or approvals required to open or operate any of our facilities.
Various federal and state labor laws govern our operations and our relationships with our employees, including such matters as minimum wage, meal and rest breaks, overtime, fringe benefits, safety, working conditions and citizenship requirements. 
Minimum wages are governed by federal, state and local laws. There have been a number of increases in minimum wage in various states, as well as increasing legislative discussion at the federal level. Any significant changes in the level of minimum wages could affect our profitability. Federal and state legislatures have also proposed bills that would require paid time off at the hourly level. 
The passage of the Affordable Care Act and ongoing changes in the governing rules have required significant effort to ensure compliance. The Company has chosen to continue to make health care available to eligible employees based on the terms set forth in the plan. Further, we are providing medical, prescription drug, dental, vision and an employee assistance program through an insurance carrier, as we attempt to manage overall health care costs. In the first years under the Affordable Care Act (calendar years 2014 and 2015) we experienced a more significant increase in costs than we had anticipated and were unable to mitigate the cost to the Company by re-distributing the cost of the coverage between the Company and employees. Continued, significant cost increases and administrative burdens will continue to affect our profitability and our ability to continue our current health care strategy.
The nature of our business requires employees to work weekends and nontraditional schedules at times. These factors make it imperative that we carefully monitor and manage the hours that nonexempt employees work to remain compliant with overtime pay and health care regulations. As the definitions and enforcement of overtime and overtime exemption regulations continue to change at the federal and state levels, we may need to consider making changes in these classifications, which could result in higher payroll costs and negatively impact profitability.
Bob Evans must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (“ADA”) and related state statutes. In pertinent part, the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to public accommodations and employment. Under the ADA and related state laws, when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of existing or new facilities, we must ensure each facility meets the accessibility requirements of all applicable laws and regulations. We also must make reasonable accommodations for the employment of people with disabilities.
As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to a number of food safety regulations, including regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and the Food and Drug Administration. These agencies enact and enforce regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution and safety of food in the United States. Among other matters, these agencies: enforce statutory prohibitions against misbranded and adulterated foods; establish safety standards for food processing; establish standards for ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain foods; establish standards for identifying certain foods; determine the safety of food additives; establish labeling standards and nutrition labeling requirements for food products; and enforce regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases. In addition, various states regulate our operations by: enforcing federal and state standards for selected food products; grading food products; licensing and inspecting plants and warehouses; regulating trade practices related to the 
10

sale of food products; and imposing their own labeling requirements on food products. Some of the food commodities we use in our operations are also subject to governmental agricultural programs. These programs have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to congressional and administrative review.
Through our sausage manufacturing operations, we are subject to the requirements of the Packers & Stockyards Act (the “P&S Act”). The general purpose of the P&S Act is to: (1) assure fair competition and fair trade practices; (2) safeguard farmers and ranchers; (3) protect consumers; and (4) protect members of the livestock, meat and poultry industries from unfair, deceptive, unjustly discriminatory and monopolistic practices. The P&S Act is administered by the Grain Inspection, Packers & Stockyards Administration (“GIPSA”), which is part of the USDA. Among other requirements, the P&S Act requires meat packers to be bonded, which provides trust protection for producers in the event they are not paid for livestock by a meat packer, and requires that livestock producers be paid promptly by meat packers for the sale of livestock. Violations of the P&S Act may be resolved through a notice of violation, a stipulation agreement with GIPSA, administrative actions and court actions.
We are subject to federal and state environmental regulations, including various laws concerning the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, such as cleaning solvents. These regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date. We do not anticipate that compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or which otherwise relate to the protection of the environment, will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, revenues or competitive position.
U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations are increasingly being enacted to address concerns about the effects that carbon dioxide emissions and other identified greenhouse gases (“GHG”) may have on the environment and climate worldwide. One or more of our manufacturing facilities could be covered by such new legislation. As in virtually every industry, GHG emissions occur at several points across our operations, including production, transportation and processing. Compliance with future legislation, if any, and compliance with currently evolving regulation of GHGs by the Environmental Protection Agency and states may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and operating costs. In the event that any future compliance requirements at any of our facilities require more than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor emissions and improve our energy efficiency, we may experience increases in our costs of operation. These regulatory changes may also lead to higher cost of goods and services, which may be passed on to us by suppliers. Based on information currently available to us, we believe that compliance with these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us.
From time to time, we receive notices and inquiries from regulatory authorities and others asserting that we are not in compliance with particular laws and regulations. In some instances, litigation ensues. In addition, individuals may initiate litigation against us. Many of our facilities are subject to environmental permits and other regulatory requirements, violations of which are subject to civil and criminal sanction. In some cases, third parties may also have the right to sue to enforce compliance.
Employees
As of April 28, 2017, we employed approximately 1,000 employees, including approximately 200 salaried employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider overall relations with our employees to be satisfactory. As part of the recent acquisition of PFPC, we added approximately 200 employees, of which approximately 40 are salaried.
