 Item 1. Business
Overview 
 Aradigm Corporation (the Company, our company, we, our, or us) are an emerging specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of products for the treatment and prevention of severe respiratory diseases. Over the last decade, we invested a large amount of capital to develop drug delivery technologies, particularly the development of a significant amount of expertise in respiratory (pulmonary) drug delivery as incorporated in our lead product candidate that recently completed two Phase 3 clinical trials, Linhaliq inhaled ciprofloxacin, formerly known as Pulmaquin®. The key asset we have focused our efforts on in recent years is our inhaled ciprofloxacin formulations. 
 We believe that our cash and cash equivalents of approximately $7.1 million as of December 31, 2017, will only be sufficient to fund our operations for the first quarter of 2018. We will not be able to maintain our current level of regulatory and product development activity and there is substantial doubt about our companys ability to continue as a going concern unless we raise additional capital in early 2018. Accordingly, we need to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities, royalty financing transactions, strategic transactions or otherwise to enable us to maintain our business operations and to continue development of our lead product candidate Linhaliq and other products, and if we are unable to do so we will need to dispose of our assets or technology or cease operations. The discussion of future prospects of our business below is based on the assumption that we are able to obtain the necessary capital to continue to operate our business as described below. 
 On February 9, 2018, our Board of Directors approved temporary measures intended to preserve our cash resources until additional sources of capital can be identified. These cash preservation measures include, among other things, the termination of the Amended and Restated Aradigm Corporation Executive Officer Severance Benefit Plan, the reduction of the annual base salary of certain executive officers to 50% of their then current annual base salaries, and the reduction of cash compensation paid to members of the Board for services on the Board or committees of the Board to 50% of the then current cash compensation. 
 Effective February 11, 2018, each of Igor Gonda, President and Chief Executive Officer; Juergen Froehlich, Chief Medical Officer; and Nancy Pecota, Vice President, Finance, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary resigned all offices and positions held by him or her with Aradigm. In February, 2018, the Board appointed Dr. John Siebert, Chairman of the Board, to serve as Executive Chairman, Interim Principal Executive Officer, Acting Principal Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary. In addition, in February 2018, Dr. Gonda and David Bell resigned from the Board of Directors. 
 In July 2017, we submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, or FDA, for Linhaliq for the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, or NCFBE, patients with chronic lung infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In January 2018, we announced that the FDA provided a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, regarding the NDA stating that it cannot approve the NDA in its present form and providing specific reasons for this action along with recommendations needed for resubmission; the areas of concern include clinical data, human factors validation study and product quality. The recommendations in the CRL include an independent third party verification of the Phase 3 results via analyses of source data as per the statistical analysis plan, or SAP, and an additional Phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrates a significant treatment effect on clinically meaningful endpoints which could evaluate the co-primary endpoints of frequency and severity of exacerbations to assess for evidence of durable efficacy over a period of two years (or more, if scientifically justified). The CRL also included a request to conduct another Human Factors Study to demonstrate that the product packaging and instructions for use are effective, and the CRL requested, among other things, additional product quality information with respect to microbiology and a new in vitro drug release method development report. We plan to request a Type A post-action meeting with the FDA to discuss the topics covered 
 
4 


  in the CRL as well as a potential path forward using the limited population pathway that was enacted in the 21st Century Cures Act. 
 In March 2018, we submitted a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, seeking approval for Linhaliq for the treatment of NCFBE patients with chronic lung infection with P. aeruginosa. Our submission is based on the positive Phase 3 clinical trials ARD-3150-1202 or Orbit 4 with a primary endpoint of frequency of exacerbations which differs from the U.S. FDA primary endpoint of time to first exacerbation and supporting evidence from proprietary preclinical and clinical studies, as well as referencing additional information about ciprofloxacin from publicly available sources. The company had pre-submission meetings with EMA in October and November of 2017 to discuss the results of these studies. The submission is expected to be validated by EMA at the end of March 2018 at which time Day 1 of the MAA review procedure will commence. The company expects to receive comments or questions 120 days after validation. 
 In addition, although our shares are currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq, on February 28, 2018, we received a notice from Nasdaq that, effective as of the appointment of Dr. John Siebert as our Executive Chairman and Interim Principal Executive Officer on February 11, 2018, we are no longer in compliance with Nasdaqs independent director and audit committee requirements as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605. On March 9, 2018 we received a notice from Nasdaq, stating that based on information regarding the appointment of a new independent director to the Board and the Audit Committee, the staff of Nasdaq has determined that we now comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605. 
 On March 7, 2018 we received a notice from Nasdaq that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), as we have not maintained a minimum Market Value of Listed Securities of $35 million or shareholders equity of at least $2.5 million among other requirements for continued listing. Pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we have 180 days or until September 4, 2018, to regain compliance with the minimum shareholders equity requirement. (For more information, see Item 1ARisk FactorsNasdaq has notified us that we are no longer in compliance with Nasdaqs continued listing requirements. If we fail to regain compliance, we will be subject to delisting by Nasdaq. If we are delisted, our stock price may decline and the liquidity of our securities and our ability to raise capital could be significantly impaired.) We cannot assure you that we will be successful in regaining compliance with Nasdaq continued listing requirements or that we will be able to meet Nasdaq listing standards going forward. 
 Our business has focused on opportunities in the development of drugs for the treatment of severe respiratory disease. Pulmonary delivery by inhalation is an effective, widely used and well accepted method of administration of a variety of drugs for the treatment of respiratory and other diseases. Compared to other routes of administration, inhalation provides local delivery of the drug to the respiratory tract which offers a number of potential advantages, including rapid onset of action, less drug required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect, and reduced side effects because the rest of the body has lower exposure to the drug. We believe that there still are significant unmet medical needs in the respiratory disease market, both to replace existing therapies that demonstrate suboptimal efficacy or undesired side effects over prolonged use in patients, as well as to provide novel treatments to patient populations and for disease conditions that are inadequately treated. 
 In selecting our proprietary development programs, we seek drugs approved by the FDA that can be reformulated for both existing and new indications in respiratory disease, or drugs that have been developed by others. Our intent is to use our pulmonary delivery methods and formulations to improve their safety, efficacy and convenience of administration to patients. We believe that this strategy will allow us to reduce costs, development times and risks of failure, when compared to the discovery of new drugs. 
 Our lead development candidates are proprietary formulations of the potent antibiotic ciprofloxacin (Linhaliq (ARD-3150) and Lipoquin® (ARD-3100)) that are delivered by inhalation for the management of infections associated with severe respiratory diseases such as NCFBE, cystic fibrosis, or CF, and 
 
5 


  non-tuberculosis mycobacterium, or NTM. These product candidates are also tested for prophylaxis and treatment against potential bioterrorism infections. The formulations differ in the proportion of rapidly available and slow release ciprofloxacin. Linhaliq uses the slow release liposomal formulation (Lipoquin) mixed with a smaller amount of ciprofloxacin dissolved in an aqueous medium. We have been granted orphan drug designation from the FDA for Linhaliq for the management of Bronchiectasis (BE). We received orphan drug designations for Lipoquin for both CF and NCFBE in the United States and for CF in the EU. We may seek orphan drug designation for other eligible product candidates we develop. In May 2014, the FDA designated Linhaliq as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP. The QIDP designation was granted for the treatment of NCFBE patients with chronic lung infections with P. aeruginosa. 
 In August 2013, we entered into a collaboration with Grifols as part of our inhaled ciprofloxacin program for non-biodefense indications. We partnered with Grifols via a license and collaboration agreement, or the Grifols License Agreement, under which we granted Grifols an exclusive, worldwide license to our inhaled liposomal ciprofloxacin product candidates for the indication of non-NCFBE and other indications, as more fully described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company is responsible for developing its lead product candidate Linhaliq for the treatment of NCFBE, with Grifols funding $65 million for the development of this product. The Grifols-funded budget was fully utilized by the year ended December 31, 2015. We also received milestone payments of $5 million upon initiation of the Phase 3 program and $5 million upon the filing of the U.S. NDA. Additionally, Grifols will pay additional development milestone payments to us for up to a total of $15 million, including a $5 million milestone payment payable upon U.S. approval of Linhaliq and the remainder contingent upon achieving first regulatory approvals of Linhaliq in the EU, Japan and China, along with royalty payments on net sales of the Aradigm products. 
 Additionally, we also entered into a governance agreement with Grifols, or the Grifols Governance Agreement, that sets forth certain rights and obligations of us and Grifols concerning, among other things, certain corporate governance matters, certain limitations on future acquisitions of shares of common stock by Grifols, and certain rights by Grifols to maintain a target level of ownership in us, as more fully described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our strategy is to develop and commercialize products for the treatment of rare, severe respiratory diseases with unmet or poorly met patients needs. Our goal is to use our pulmonary delivery methods and formulations to optimize the safety, efficacy, and convenience of administration to patients of already approved drugs or those discovered by others. We believe that this strategy will allow us to reduce costs, development times and risks of failure when compared to the discovery of new drugs. 
 We believe that our proprietary formulation and delivery technologies and our experience in the development and management of pulmonary clinical programs uniquely position us to benefit from opportunities in the respiratory disease market, as well as other disease markets that would benefit from the efficient, non-invasive inhalation delivery of drugs. 
 To date, we have not had any significant product sales and do not anticipate receiving revenues from the sale of any of our products in the near term. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $455.2 million. In 2016, we sold $23,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of our 9% senior notes convertible into shares of common stock due 2021, or the Convertible Notes, and 263,436 related warrants to purchase our common stock, or the Note Financing. Historically, we have primarily funded our operations through convertible debt such as the Note Financing, development expense reimbursements, license fees, milestone payments from collaborators, public offerings and private placements of our capital stock, the milestone and royalty payments associated with the sale of assets to a third party, a royalty financing transaction and interest earned on cash equivalents and short-term investments.

 Our Strategy 
 We are a specialty pharmaceutical company, and our strategy is to develop and commercialize products for the treatment and prevention of severe respiratory diseases. We have a portfolio of proprietary technologies that may potentially address significant unmet medical needs for unique or significantly improved products in the global respiratory market. There are three key elements of our strategy: 

 | Develop proprietary products for the treatment of respiratory diseases. We believe our expertise in the development and delivery of pulmonary pharmaceutical products should enable us to advance and commercialize respiratory products for a variety of indications. We select for development those product candidates that can benefit from our experience in pulmonary delivery and that we believe are likely to provide a superior therapeutic profile or other valuable benefits to patients when compared to existing products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Accelerate the regulatory approval process. We believe that our management teams expertise in pharmaceutical inhalation products, new indications, and reformulations of existing drugs will enable us to pursue the most appropriate regulatory pathway for our product candidates. Because our current product candidates incorporate FDA-approved drugs, we believe that the most expedient review and approval pathway for these product candidates in the United States will be under Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the FDA to rely on scientific literature or on the FDAs prior findings of safety and/or effectiveness for approved drug products. We have already been granted or intend to pursue orphan drug designation for our products when appropriate. Orphan drug designation may be granted to drugs and biologics that treat rare, life-threatening diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States. Such designation provides a company with the possibility of market exclusivity for 7 years as well as regulatory assistance, reduced filing fees, and possible tax credits. Similar legislation exists in the EU with a market exclusivity of 10 years. We also seek other special designations by FDA such as QIDP. Under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act, QIDP provides incentives including priority review and eligibility for fast-track status. Further, if ultimately approved by the FDA, the product is eligible for an additional five-year extension of Hatch-Waxman exclusivity.

 | Outsource manufacturing activities. We outsource the late-stage clinical and commercial scale manufacturing of our products to conserve our capital for product development. We believe that the required late-stage clinical and commercial manufacturing capacity can be obtained from contract manufacturers. With this approach, we seek manufacturers whose expertise should allow us to reduce risk and the costs normally incurred if we were to build, operate and maintain large-scale production facilities ourselves.

 Partnered Programs Under Development
Inhaled Ciprofloxacin 
 See Part 1, Item 1 of the 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information and discussion regarding earlier development efforts on Inhaled Ciprofloxacin. 
 We have been developing several disease indications for our inhaled ciprofloxacin that share much of the laboratory and product development efforts, as well as a common safety database. 
 Linhaliq and Lipoquin (ARD-3150 and ARD-3100)Inhaled Ciprofloxacin for the Management of Infections in Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis (NCFBE) Patients 
 BE is a chronic condition characterized by abnormal dilatation of the bronchi and bronchioles associated with chronic infection. The patients lung function is often irreversibly reduced compared to that in healthy individuals. BE is frequently observed in patients with CF. However, it is a condition that affects over 150,000 people without CF in the United States with a higher incidence seen in other countries, and results from a cycle 
 
7 


  of inflammation, recurrent infection, and bronchial wall damage. There is currently no drug specifically approved for the treatment of BE in the U.S. The FDA granted orphan drug designation for Linhaliq for the management of BE in June 2011. 
 In May 2014, we announced that the FDA designated Linhaliq as a QIDP. The QIDP designation, granted for treatment of NCFBE patients with chronic lung infections with P. aeruginosa, will make Linhaliq eligible to benefit from certain incentives for the development of new antibiotics provided under the GAIN Act. These incentives include priority review and eligibility for fast-track status. Further, if ultimately approved by the FDA, Linhaliq is eligible for an additional five-year extension of Hatch-Waxman exclusivity. 
 In September 2014, we announced that the FDA granted Fast Track designation to Linhaliq for NCFBE patients with chronic lung infections with P. aeruginosa. The FDA gives Fast Track status to facilitate the development of new drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs, with the goal of getting important new drugs to patients earlier. According to the FDA, determining whether a condition is serious is a matter of judgment, but generally is based on whether the drug will have an impact on such factors as survival, day-to-day functioning, or the likelihood that the condition, if left untreated, will progress from a less severe condition to a more serious one. 
 A drug that receives Fast Track designation is eligible for some or all of the following: 
 

 | More frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the drugs development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Eligibility for Priority Review, if relevant criteria are met
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


 | Rolling Review, which means that a drug company can submit completed sections of its New Drug Application, or NDA, for review by FDA, rather than waiting until every section of the application is completed before the entire application can be reviewed. NDA review usually does not begin until the drug company has submitted the entire application to the FDA
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 According to the FDA, once a drug receives Fast Track designation, early and frequent communication between the FDA and a drug company is encouraged throughout the entire drug development and review process. The frequency of communication assures that questions and issues may be resolved quickly, often leading to earlier drug approval and access by patients. 
 In March 2016, we announced that the EMA had approved our request to review Linhaliq under the Centralised Authorisation Procedure drug review process; this procedure results in a single marketing authorization that is valid in all 28 European Union countries, as well as three European Economic Area countries. We requested, and were granted, the centralized pathway on the basis that Linhaliq represents a significant technical innovation for the potential treatment of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis associated with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. 
 We believe we have the preclinical development, clinical and regulatory expertise to advance this product through development. In August 2013, we licensed to Grifols on an exclusive, worldwide basis, our inhaled liposomal ciprofloxacin product candidates for the indication of NCFBE and other indications. We also obtained a royalty-bearing license for biodefense applications from Grifols. 
 Development of Inhaled Ciprofloxacin for BE 
 See Part 1, Item 1 of the 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information and discussion regarding earlier efforts on the Development of Inhaled Ciprofloxacin for BE. 
 We had been testing two formulations of inhaled ciprofloxacin (Linhaliq and Lipoquin) that differ in the proportion of rapidly available and slow release ciprofloxacin. Linhaliq (also called Dual Release Ciprofloxacin 
 
8 


  for InhalationDRCFI) uses the slow release liposomal formulation (Lipoquin, also called Ciprofloxacin for InhalationCFI) mixed with a small amount of ciprofloxacin dissolved in an aqueous medium. The clinical activities described below for Lipoquin also support the Linhaliq program. 
 In December 2011, we completed the analysis of all preclinical and clinical data from the two different formulations of inhaled ciprofloxacin (Lipoquin and Linhaliq) and determined that Linhaliq showed superior performance; therefore, we took Linhaliq forward into Phase 3 clinical trials. In order to expedite anticipated time to market and increase market acceptance, we have elected to deliver our formulations via an approved, widely-accepted nebulizer system in many countries including US and EU, for each of our clinical trials and we intend to continue using this approach and obtain the initial marketing approval with this currently FDA-approved nebulizer system. 
 The Phase 3 clinical program for Linhaliq in NCFBE consisted of two worldwide, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal trials (ORBIT-3 and ORBIT-4) that are identical in design except for a pharmacokinetics sub-study that was conducted in one of the trials. Each trial enrolled patients (278 in ORBIT-3 and 304 in ORBIT-4) into a 48-week double-blind period consisting of 6 cycles of 28 days on treatment with Linhaliq or placebo plus 28 days off treatment, followed by a 28 day open-label extension in which all participants received Linhaliq (total treatment duration, including the double-blind period, of approximately one year). The superiority of Linhaliq vs. placebo during the double-blind period was evaluated in terms of the time to first pulmonary exacerbation (primary endpoint), while key secondary endpoints included the reduction in the number of PEs and improvements in quality of life measures. Lung function was monitored as a safety indicator. 
 In December 2016, we announced top-line results for both studies. In ORBIT-4 the median time to first mild, moderate or severe pulmonary exacerbation, or PE, was 230 days in the Linhaliq treatment group as compared to 163 days in the placebo group. This increase in the median time to first PE was statistically significant (p=0.0462) using non-stratified log-rank analysis. In the key secondary efficacy endpoint, there was a 37% reduction in the frequency of PEs over the 48-week treatment period in the Linhaliq treatment group as compared to the placebo group. This result was statistically significant (p=0.0007) with a Hazard Ratio of Linhaliq/placebo of 0.63 using non-stratified binomial regression. 
 In ORBIT-3 the median time to first mild, moderate or severe PE was 221 days in the Linhaliq treatment group as compared to 136 days in the placebo group. This increase in the median time to first PE was similar to ORBIT-4 but was not statistically significant (p=0.8488) using non-stratified log-rank analysis. In the key secondary efficacy endpoint, there was a 13% reduction in the frequency of PEs over the 48-week treatment period in the Linhaliq treatment group as compared to the placebo group. This result was not statistically significant (p=0.3125) with a Hazard Ratio of Linhaliq/placebo of 0.87 using non-stratified binomial regression. 
 The analyses of combined data from both studies resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the number of PEs over the 48-week double-blind period (Hazard Ratio Linhaliq/placebo: 0.73; p=0.0015), representing a 27% reduction in PEs over the period. 
 When the additional analyses of combined data from both studies were conducted taking into account only PEs that were moderate or severe (i.e., those that required interventions with antibiotics or hospitalization) the median time to first PE in the Linhaliq group was 302 days vs. placebo 198 days (p=0.0217). There was also a statistically significant reduction in the number of moderate and severe PEs over the 48-week double-blind period (Hazard Ratio Linhaliq/placebo: 0.67; p=0.0002) using non-stratified analysis, representing a 33% reduction in PEs over the period. 
 In each study, the treatment groups were stratified for gender, pre-trial frequency of exacerbations and smoking status. The Statistical Analysis Plan for the studies called for stratified analyses; however, since some strata were found to have no or very few subjects, both non-stratified and stratified analyses were conducted. We believe that due to the limited number of subjects in some strata the non-stratified analyses are more appropriate 
 
9 


  as strata that are too small can produce highly unstable estimated treatment effects with potential outliers. Using the stratified analyses, the median time to first PE in ORBIT-3 was Linhaliq: 221 days; placebo: 136 days; p=0.7681 and for ORBIT-4 was Linhaliq: 230 days; placebo: 163 days; p=0.0885. 
 Both studies demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in P. aeruginosa density at Day 28, the end of the first on-treatment period (ORBIT-3: p=<0.0001; ORBIT-4: p=<0.0001). For each study, the magnitude of this antibiotic effect remained persistent throughout all on-treatment periods. 
 Linhaliq was safe and well tolerated in both studies. There were no differences in the changes of lung function (FEV1 % predicted and FVC % predicted) or symptoms of airway irritation between the Linhaliq and placebo groups in the two studies. Overall, the incidence of all treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) was similar between the Linhaliq and placebo groups in both ORBIT-3 (Linhaliq: 89.6%; placebo: 91.6%) and ORBIT-4 (Linhaliq: 86.4%; placebo: 96.9%). In ORBIT-3 the rates of serious TEAEs were 30.6% with Linhaliq and 25.3% with placebo while in ORBIT-4 the rates were 17.0% versus 28.6%. 
 For each study, the randomization rate of Linhaliq treated subjects to placebo was 2 to 1. There were 8 deaths in ORBIT-3 (Linhaliq: 5 (2.7%); placebo: 3 (3.2%)) and 6 deaths in ORBIT-4 (Linhaliq: 2 (1.0%); placebo: 4 (4.1%)). None of the deaths was related to Linhaliq or placebo. The most frequently observed treatment-related TEAEs were of respiratory/thoracic/mediastinal nature and were reported in ORBIT-3 by 25.7% of subjects with Linhaliq and in 21.1% of subjects with placebo, while the rates in ORBIT-4 were 16.5% with Linhaliq versus 19.4% with placebo. 
 After the completion of the 48-week double-blind period, both Linhaliq and placebo-treated patients were given the opportunity to receive Linhaliq in a 28-day open-label extension period. Ninety seven percent of the patients who completed study drug in the double blind phase of ORBIT-3 and 96% percent of the patients who completed study drug in the double blind phase of ORBIT-4 enrolled in the extension period. 
 We held pre-NDA meetings with the FDA in December 2016 and March 2017 to discuss our Phase 3 studies. 
 In July 2017, we submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA for Linhaliq for the treatment of NCFBE patients with chronic lung infections with P. aeruginosa. Pursuant to the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) Sec. 115(a) and FDA guidance, Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products (May 1998), we submitted the Linhaliq NDA based on the positive pivotal clinical trial ARD-3150-1202 (ORBIT-4) and confirmatory evidence from Phase 3 study ARD-3150-1201 (ORBIT-3) and Phase 2b study ARD-3150-0902 (ORBIT-2), together with other supporting evidence from proprietary preclinical and clinical studies, as well as referencing other information about ciprofloxacin from publicly available sources. In September 2017, the FDA completed the 60-day filing review period and accepted the NDA for filing. 
 In January 2018, we announced that the FDA provided a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding the NDA stating that it cannot approve the NDA in its present form and providing specific reasons for this action along with recommendations needed for resubmission; the areas of concern include clinical data, human factors validation study and product quality. The recommendations in the CRL include an independent third party verification of the Phase 3 results via analyses of source data as per the statistical analysis plan (SAP) and an additional Phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrates a significant treatment effect on clinically meaningful endpoints which could evaluate the co-primary endpoints of frequency and severity of exacerbations to assess for durable evidence of efficacy over a period of two years (or more, if scientifically justified). The CRL also included a request to conduct another Human Factors Study to demonstrate that the product packaging and instructions for use are effective, and the CRL requested, among other things, additional product quality information with respect to microbiology and a new in vitro drug release method development report. We remain confident in the efficacy, safety and quality of Linhaliq and plan to request a Type A post-action meeting with 
 
10 


  the FDA to discuss the topics covered in the CRL with the view to developing plans to move towards resubmission of the Linhaliq NDA as soon as possible. We are committed to continue working on the approval of Linhaliq in the US for NCFBE patients who have very severe disease with high morbidity and mortality and no available treatment options. 
 In March 2018, we submitted a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, seeking approval for Linhaliq for the treatment of NCFBE patients with chronic lung infection with P. aeruginosa. Our submission is based on the positive Phase 3 clinical trials ARD-3150-1202 or Orbit 4 with a primary endpoint of frequency of exacerbations which differs from the U.S. FDA primary endpoint of time to first exacerbation and supporting evidence from proprietary preclinical and clinical studies, as well as referencing additional information about ciprofloxacin from publicly available sources. The company had pre-submission meetings with EMA in October and November of 2017 to discuss the results of these studies. The submission is expected to be validated by EMA at the end of March 2018 at which time Day 1 of the MAA review procedure will commence. The company expects to receive comments or questions 120 days after validation. 
 Liposomal Ciprofloxacin for Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria 
 In August 2013, the National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, awarded us a Small Business Initiative Research, or SBIR, grant in the amount of approximately $278,000 to investigate the treatment of PNTM infections with our inhaled liposomal ciprofloxacin product candidates, Linhaliq and Lipoquin. The research program was conducted in collaboration with Oregon State University, Corvallis (OSU). 
 According to a report from the National Institutes of Health based on an epidemiological study in U.S. adults aged 65 years or older, PNTM infections are an important cause of morbidity among older adults in the United States. From 1997 to 2007, the annual prevalence significantly increased from 20 to 47 cases/100,000 persons or 8.2% per year. Forty-four percent of PNTM-affected people in the study had bronchiectasis compared to 1% in the non-PNTM cases pointing to an important co-morbidity. A recent study from NIH reported that in 2010 they estimated 86,244 national cases, totaling to $815 million burden, of which 87% were inpatient-related ($709 million), and 13% were outpatient-related ($106 million) costs. Of all costs incurred, medications comprised 76% of nontuberculous mycobacterial disease expenditures. PNTM infections are also common in patients with other chronic lung conditions, such as cystic fibrosis and emphysema. In patients with AIDS, the infection is disseminated. These infections are particularly difficult to treat as the mycobacteria can form biofilms in the airways and they are able to cause intracellular infections, e.g., by invasion of pulmonary macrophages. The current clinical paradigm is to treat patients with lung or disseminated disease with combination therapy given orally or by IV. Unfortunately, these therapies often fail and may have significant side effects. 
 The Phase II SBIR grant builds upon the encouraging results demonstrated in the Phase I SBIR grant that found both Linhaliq and Lipoquin to have significant efficacy against M. avium complex and M. abscessus infection. The current standard of treatment of mycobacterial infections is the simultaneous use of multiple antibiotics, and the Phase II grant will focus on combination therapies using a variety of techniques that were used and developed in the Phase 1 stage of this research. 
 On April 15, 2015, we announced the first results from the collaboration between scientists from OSU and Aradigm funded by NIH. The research demonstrated that after 4 days of in vitro treatment of human macrophages infected with Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium abscessus, Aradigms liposomal ciprofloxacin was associated with a decrease of greater than 99% of these infections at ciprofloxacin concentrations of 200 mcg/ml, which approximate the peak sputum levels observed in humans in prior Aradigm clinical studies. At a lower concentration of 20 mcg/ml, the liposomal concentrations still showed statistically significant decreases greater than 70% for M. avium and greater than 90% for M. abscessus. Unencapsulated ciprofloxacin showed smaller decreases which were only statistically significant at 200 mcg/ml. Liposomal 
 
11 


  ciprofloxacin at a concentration of 100 mcg/ml significantly reduced the population of these mycobacteria in a biofilm assay by more than 50% whereas unencapsulated ciprofloxacin did not show statistically significant decreases. 
 In May 2015, we announced that scientists from OSU and Aradigm demonstrated that Aradigms investigational drugs Lipoquin and Linhaliq significantly reduced the growth of PNTM after 3 weeks of once-daily respiratory tract dosing in mice. The number of colony forming units (CFUs) of Mycobacterium avium subsp hominissuis was reduced by 79% and 77% by Lipoquin and Linhaliq, respectively (p<0.05) compared to saline controls. In contrast, unencapsulated ciprofloxacin had no effect. 
 In September 2015, we announced that scientists from OSU and Aradigm demonstrated that Aradigms investigational drugs Lipoquin and Linhaliq significantly reduced PNTM with Mycobacterium abscessus using once daily respiratory tract dosing in mice that had established colonization with this microorganism. After 3 weeks of treatment, the number of CFUs in the lungs was significantly reduced (p<0.05) by 95.2% and 96.1% by Lipoquin and Linhaliq, respectively; after 6 weeks of treatment, the CFUs were further reduced (p<0.05) by 99.7% and 99.4% for Lipoquin and Linhaliq, respectively. In contrast, unencapsulated ciprofloxacin had no effect. 
 This collaboration between OSU and Aradigm resulted in inventions leading to several patent applications. In January 2017, Patent no. 9,532,986 titled Liposomal Ciprofloxacin Formulations with Activity Against Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria was issued by the US Patent Office, with OSU and Aradigm being the assignees. 
 In August 2017, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded us a Small Business Initiative Research (SBIR) grant to investigate the treatment of two pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacteria (PNTM) infections, Mycobacterium avium (M. avium) and Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus), with Linhaliq and Lipoquin. Aradigm will work together with Oregon State University, Corvallis (OSU), who will lead the laboratory research as a part of the consortium funded by this two year grant of approximately $972,000. 
 Liposomal Ciprofloxacin for Biodefense Purposes: Treatment of Q Fever, Tularemia, Pneumonic Plague, Inhalation Anthrax and other biodefense purposes 
 In addition to our programs addressing BE, CF, and PTNM, our inhaled ciprofloxacin has also been tested for the prevention and treatment of inhaled bioterrorism infections, such as Coxiella burnetii, or Q fever, inhalation anthrax, tularemia, melioidosis and pneumonic plague. We have obtained a royalty-bearing license for the biodefense applications from Grifols. 
 In September 2012, UK scientists from the Health Protection Agency, or HPA, and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, or Dstl, reported the successful testing of our inhaled liposomal ciprofloxacin against Q fever in a mouse model of this infection. This work was conducted as part of the collaborative consortium that we formed with HPA and Dstl to evaluate the efficacy of our inhaled liposomal ciprofloxacin against high threat microbial agents. 
 Coxiella burnetii is a Gram-negative intracellular bacterium and the causative agent of the disease Q fever. C. burnetii is endemic worldwide, infects a wide variety of animals and humans and has a low infectious dose by the inhalational route. Clinical presentation in humans may lead to an acute infection with flu-like symptoms or a chronic, life-threatening disease. An epidemic of Q fever in humans took place in the Netherlands in 2009, with 2,357 reported cases and 6 deaths. Current oral antibiotic treatment of Q fever can be lengthy and complex. 
 In the experiments reported by the UK scientists, mice that were infected with C. burnetii via inhalation and treated 24 hours later with twice-daily oral ciprofloxacin continuing for 6 additional days, or infected drug-free 
 
12 


  control-treated animals that had the same treatment schedule, lost almost 20% of body weight by day 7 and exhibited clinical signs of the disease. In contrast, infected mice treated 24 hours later with once-daily lung-delivered liposomal ciprofloxacin continuing for 6 additional days, were significantly protected against weight loss and showed no clinical signs of disease throughout the 14-day duration of the study. 
 In November 2012, scientists from the Dstl reported in a preliminary study that they demonstrated that a single dose of Aradigms liposomal ciprofloxacin formulation Lipoquin administered 24 hours after exposure to a lethal dose of the bacterium Yersinia pestis provided full protection in a murine model of pneumonic plague. In comparison, a single dose of oral ciprofloxacin administered 24 hours post-exposure provided no protection. 
 The Gram-negative bacterium Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague, a disease thought to be responsible for the death of 200 million people through devastating pandemics such as the Black Death. Inhalation of Y. pestis can result in the most severe form of the disease, pneumonic plague, which if untreated may have a mortality rate of 100%. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine for use in humans. 
 In the study, exposure to aerosolized Y. pestis was lethal. Animals were followed for up to 28 days post-exposure. All untreated mice succumbing to a systemic infection by day 3 post-exposure. A single dose of oral ciprofloxacin administered at 24 hours post-exposure did not prevent mortality and only increased the mean time to death to 5 days compared to 3 days for untreated mice. In comparison, a single dose of Lipoquin delivered via the nose into the lungs of the animals provided 100% protection and significantly improved survival compared to a single dose of oral ciprofloxacin (P<0.0001); a single dose of aerosolized Lipoquin administered at 24 hours post-exposure provided approximately 70% protection and significantly improved survival when compared to a single dose of oral ciprofloxacin (P<0.001). 
 In their report, the scientists state that the study demonstrated the superior efficacy of Lipoquin compared to oral ciprofloxacin as post-exposure prophylaxis against Y. pestis. 
 The Dstl team also demonstrated in another series of experiments that a single dose of our inhaled liposomal ciprofloxacin protects animals against lethal doses of inhaled Francisella tularensis (tularemia) infectionanother microbial threat. These results confirmed and extended the research that we began originally under a technology demonstration program funded by the Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) as part of their interest in developing products to counter bioterrorism, such as inhaled anthrax and tularemia infections. DRDC had already demonstrated the feasibility of inhaled liposomal ciprofloxacin for post-exposure prophylaxis of Francisella tularensis. Mice were exposed to a lethal dose of Francisella tularensis and then 24 hours later were exposed via inhalation to a single dose of free ciprofloxacin, liposomal ciprofloxacin or saline. All the mice in the control group and the free ciprofloxacin group were dead within 11 days post-infection; in contrast, all the mice in the liposomal ciprofloxacin group were alive 14 days post-infection. The same results were obtained when the mice received the single inhaled treatment as late as 48 or 72 hours post-infection. 
 In October 2016, we announced that Dstl received funding of up to $6.9 million from the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency, or DTRA, for a program entitled Inhalational ciprofloxacin for improved protection against biowarfare agents. The inhalational ciprofloxacin formulations used in this program are our proprietary investigational drugs Linhaliq and Lipoquin. The total potential funding provided to Dstl is $3.2 million for the base period and $3.7 million for the option period. The initial funding released is $1.7 million. Dstl, in conjunction with its key sub-contractors, including Aradigm, will conduct research relating to the efficacy of Linhaliq and Lipoquin in animal models of Francisella tularensis (tularemia), Burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis), Burkholderia mallei (glanders) and Q fever. The most likely method for infection with biowarfare agents is via the pulmonary route. The main advantage of the inhaled liposomal ciprofloxacin approach is that it delivers the antibiotic rapidly and directly in high concentrations to the respiratory tractthe area of primary infectionand the liposomal formulation retains it there over a prolonged period of time. The liposomal formulation also facilitates intracellular uptake, essential to treat these life-threatening intracellular infections. The funding from DTRA will enable us to validate and expand this approach with the goal of providing broad-spectrum prophylaxis and treatment against multiple bioterrorism threats. 
 
13 


 If we can obtain sufficient additional funding, including government grants or collaborative funding from organizations such as the Canadian DRDC and the UK Dstl, we may be able to complete the development of our liposomal ciprofloxacin for approval under FDA regulations relating to new drugs or biologics for potentially fatal diseases where human studies cannot be conducted ethically or practically, or the Animal Rule. Unlike most drugs, which require large, well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with the disease or condition being targeted, these regulations allow a drug to be evaluated and approved by the FDA on the basis of demonstrated safety in humans combined with studies in animal models to show effectiveness. We plan to use our preclinical and clinical safety data from our BE and CF programs to supplement the data needed to have this product candidate considered for approval for use in prevention and treatment of a number of potential bioterrorism infections including anthrax, tularemia, Q fever, melioidosis and pneumonic plague. We plan to meet with the FDA later this year to discuss approval of Linhaliq under the Animal Rule initially for tularemia.   Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights 
 Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to obtain, expand and protect our intellectual property estate, enforce patents, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of other parties. Our most recent patents issued in the United States were an important composition of matter patent and a method of treatment patent for Linhaliq. As of February 28, 2018, we had 34 issued United States patents, with 8 additional United States patent applications pending. In addition, we had 51 issued foreign patents and an additional 30 foreign patent applications pending. The bulk of our patents and patent applications contain claims directed toward our Linhaliq and Lipoquin compositions and methods of treatment, proprietary delivery technologies, including methods for aerosol generation, devices used to generate aerosols, breath control, compliance monitoring, certain pharmaceutical formulations, design of dosage forms and their manufacturing and testing methods The bulk of our patents directed toward our proprietary delivery technologies and methods of use expire between 2018 and 2035. Because patent positions can be highly uncertain and frequently involve complex legal and factual questions, the breadth of claims obtained in any application or the enforceability of our patents cannot be predicted. 
 We continue to seek to protect our proprietary position by protecting inventions that we determine are or may be important to our business. We do this, when we are able, through the filing of patent applications with claims directed toward the devices, methods, and technologies we develop. Our ability to compete effectively will depend to a significant extent on our ability and the ability of our collaborators to obtain and enforce patents and maintain trade secret protection over our proprietary technologies. The coverage claimed in a patent application typically is significantly reduced before a patent is issued, either in the United States or abroad. Consequently, any of our pending or future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents or, to the extent patents have been issued or will be issued, these patents may be subjected to further proceedings limiting their scope and may in any event not contain claims broad enough to provide meaningful protection. Patents that are issued to us or our collaborators may not provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantage and may be circumvented or invalidated. 
 We also rely on our trade secrets and the know-how of our officers, employees, consultants and other service providers. Our policy is to require our officers, employees, consultants, and advisors to execute proprietary information and invention assignment agreements upon commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the relationship shall be kept confidential except in specified circumstances. These agreements also provide that all inventions developed by the individual on behalf of us shall be assigned to us and that the individual will cooperate with us in connection with securing patent protection for the invention if we wish to pursue such protection. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our inventions, trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. 
 We also execute confidentiality agreements with outside collaborators and consultants. However, disputes may arise as to the ownership of proprietary rights to the extent that outside collaborators or consultants apply 
 
14 


  technological information developed independently by them or others to our projects, or apply our technology or proprietary information to other projects, and any such disputes may not be resolved in our favor. Even if resolved in our favor, such disputes could result in substantial expense and diversion of management attention. 
 In addition to protecting our own intellectual property rights, we must be able to develop products without infringing the proprietary rights of other parties. Because the markets in which we operate involve established competitors with significant patent portfolios, including patents relating to compositions of matter, methods of use, methods of delivery and products in those markets, it may be difficult for us to develop products without infringing the proprietary rights of others. For example, we are aware of patents recently issued in the U.S. and assigned to Insmed Incorporated, or Insmed, with claims covering methods of treatment with quinolone antibiotics, which includes ciprofloxacin, against pulmonary infections. 
 We will incur substantial costs if we are required to defend ourselves in suits, regardless of their merit. These legal actions could seek damages and seek to enjoin development, testing, manufacturing, and marketing of the allegedly infringing product. In addition to potential liability for significant damages, we could be required to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market the allegedly infringing product and any license required under any such patent may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. 
 We may determine that litigation is necessary to enforce our proprietary rights against others. Such litigation could result in substantial expense and diversion of management attention, regardless of its outcome and any litigation may not be resolved in our favor. 
 Competition 
 We are in a highly competitive industry. We compete with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, hospitals, research organizations, individual scientists and nonprofit organizations engaged in the development of drugs and other therapies for the respiratory disease indications we are targeting. Our competitors may succeed, and many have already succeeded, in developing competing products, obtaining FDA approval for products or gaining patient and physician acceptance of products before us for the same markets and indications that we are targeting. Many of these companies, and large pharmaceutical companies, in particular have greater research and development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, financial and managerial resources and experience than we have and many of these companies may have products and product candidates that are in a more advanced stage of development than our product candidates. If we are not first to market for a particular indication, it may be more difficult for us or our collaborators to enter markets unless we can demonstrate our products are clearly superior to existing therapies. 
 There is no product currently approved in the United States specifically for the treatment of bronchiectasis (BE). However, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Bayer, completed testing of a ciprofloxacin dry powder inhaler for the management of BE in two Phase 3 studies and an experimental oral drug, BAY85-8501, in a Phase 2 study in BE patients. Bayer has obtained orphan drug status for their inhaled powder formulation of ciprofloxacin in the United States for the treatment of BE and in the United States and European Union for the treatment of CF. Bayer filed an NDA for U.S. approval and was accepted for Priority Review. In November 2017, the FDAs Advisory Committee voted not to recommend Bayers dry powder ciprofloxacin to be approved for the treatment of bronchiectasis. Bayer announced in their 2017 Annual Report that they have decided to discontinue development of Cipro DPI in NCFB for the time being and will evaluate possible further options for this asset. There are also a number of other inhaled products under development to treat respiratory infections in CF, including nebulized levofloxacin by Raptor Pharmaceutical Corp. (acquired by Horizon Pharma Plc) and nebulized liposomal amikacin by Insmed for the treatment of Mycobacterium avium (a PNTM infection). 
 Currently marketed inhaled antibiotics for the management of infections associated with CF include several products containing tobramycin (nebulizer and dry powder formulations), marketed by multiple companies, and nebulized Cayston*, marketed by Gilead Sciences. Several of these products already have substantial current sales and long histories of effective and safe use. 
 
15 


 There are a number of additional product candidates in various stages of development for the treatment of respiratory infections that, if approved, could compete with any future products we may develop. 
 We believe that our respiratory expertise and pulmonary delivery and formulation technologies provide us with an important competitive advantage for our potential products. We intend to compete by developing products that are safer, more efficacious, more convenient, less costly, earlier to market or cheaper to develop than existing products, or any combination of the foregoing. 
 Government Regulation 
 United States 
 The research, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, and export, among other things, of any products we develop are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The FDA regulates drugs in the United States under the FDCA and implementing regulations thereunder. 
 If we fail to comply with the FDCA or FDA regulations, we and our products could be subject to regulatory actions. These may include a delay in approval or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, injunctions ordering us to stop the sale of any products we develop, seizure of our products, warning letters, the imposition of civil penalties or other monetary payments, criminal prosecution, and recall of our products. Any such events would harm our reputation and our results of operations. 
 Before any of our drugs may be marketed in the United States, it must be approved by the FDA. None of our current product candidates has received such approval. We believe that our products currently in development will be regulated by the FDA as drugs. 
 The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include: 
 

 | preclinical laboratory and animal tests, and formulation studies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for human clinical testing that must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each indication for which approval is sought;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (NDA) and FDAs acceptance of the NDA for filing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is to be produced to assess compliance with the FDAs Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Preclinical Testing 
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of approval, if any, is highly uncertain. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, and formulation, as well as animal studies. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND prior to that time. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials. Once an IND is in effect, the protocol for each clinical trial to be conducted under the IND must be submitted to the FDA, which may or may not allow the trial to proceed. 
 
16 


 In July 2009, we received clearance from the FDA for our IND for inhaled liposomal ciprofloxacin (ARD-3100, Lipoquin) for the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. In May 2010, we received clearance from the FDA for our IND for inhaled liposomal ciprofloxacin for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. However, an additional three-month toxicity study in animals with Lipoquin (ARD-3100) and Linhaliq (ARD-3150) was requested by the FDA to support longer-term human clinical trials. This study was completed, and the results were submitted to the FDA as part of our IND filing for the Phase 3 program for Linhaliq in BE patients. 
 In March 2012, we received clearance from the FDA for our IND to start the two Phase 3 studies of Linhaliq (ARD-3150) in BE patients. The FDA requested a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats with inhaled Linhaliq to support the NDA for BE. In December 2016, we announced that the study was completed and we had received the final statistical analysis report from the study; there were no differences in the rate of observed tumors between the Linhaliq and control groups. The FDA indicated a 9-month inhalation safety study in dogs might also be needed to support approval for marketing this product for BE in the U.S. and the EU. We have taken the initiative to conduct this study in the interest of reducing time to approval of Linhaliq. The 9-month inhalation safety study in dogs is complete, and the study report has been submitted to the FDA. 
 Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators and healthcare personnel. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, for example, the parameters to be used in monitoring patient safety and the safety and effectiveness criteria, or endpoints, to be evaluated. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three defined phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Each trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board overseeing the institution conducting the trial before it can begin. 
 These phases generally include the following: 
 

 | Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials usually involve the initial introduction of the drug into human subjects, frequently healthy volunteers. In Phase 1, the drug is usually evaluated for safety, including adverse effects, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and pharmacodynamics.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2. Phase 2 usually involves studies in a limited patient population with the disease or condition for which the drug is being developed to (1) preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted indications; (2) determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3. If a drug is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in preclinical (animal), Phase 1 and Phase 2 human studies, the clinical trial program will be expanded, usually to further evaluate clinical efficacy and safety by administering the drug in its final form to an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 3 studies usually include several hundred to several thousand patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Upon completion of the required clinical testing, the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Before approving an application, the FDA usually will inspect the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured, and will not approve the product unless continuing GMP compliance is satisfactory. If the FDA determines the NDA is not acceptable, the FDA may outline the deficiencies in the NDA and often will request additional information or additional clinical trials. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional testing or information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will usually entail limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if 
 
17 


  compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory requirements and conditions of approvals are not maintained, if GMP compliance is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing studies, referred to as Phase 4 studies, to monitor the effect of approved products and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. Post-approval use of products can lead to new findings of the safety or efficacy of the products. This information can lead to a product sponsor making, or the FDA requiring, changes in the labeling of the product or even the withdrawal of the product from the market. 
 In December 2016, we announced top-line results for the Phase 3 studies for Linhaliq in NCFBE, which consisted of the two worldwide, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal trials, ORBIT-3 and ORBIT-4, that were identical in design except for a pharmacokinetics sub-study that was conducted in one of the trials. We held pre-NDA meetings with the FDA in December 2016 and March 2017 to discuss our Phase 3 studies. This was followed in July 2017 by submission of the NDA for Linhaliq to the FDA. In January 2018, we received a CRL from the FDA regarding the NDA for Linhaliq which states that the FDA determined it cannot approve the NDA in its present form and provides specific reasons for this action. 
 Section 505(b)(2) Applications 
 Some of our product candidates may be eligible for submission of applications for approval under the FDAs Section 505(b)(2) approval process, which requires less information than the NDAs described above. Section 505(b)(2) applications may be submitted for drug products that represent a modification (e.g., a new indication or new dosage form) of an eligible approved drug and for which investigations other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies are essential to the drugs approval. Section 505(b)(2) applications may rely on the FDAs previous findings for the safety and effectiveness of the listed drug, scientific literature, and information obtained by the 505(b)(2) applicant needed to support the modification of the listed drug. For this reason, preparing Section 505(b)(2) applications is generally less costly and time-consuming than preparing an NDA based entirely on new data and information from a full set of clinical trials. The law governing Section 505(b)(2) or FDAs current policies may change in such a way as to adversely affect our applications for approval that seek to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) approach. Such changes could result in additional costs associated with additional studies or clinical trials and delays. 
 The FDCA provides that reviews and/or approvals of applications submitted under Section 505(b)(2) may be delayed in various circumstances. For example, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of market exclusivity, during which the FDA will not approve, and may not even review a Section 505(b)(2) application from other sponsors. If the listed drug is claimed by a patent that the NDA holder has listed with the FDA, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit a patent certification that: the patent information has not been filed; the patent has expired; the patent listing will expire on a given date; or that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed by the product that is the subject of the Section 505(b)(2) application. FDA itself will determine the accuracy of the first three certification bases for purposes of application approval timing. For the fourth basis (a Paragraph IV claim of no validity, non-enforceability, or non-infringement), the patent holder must use the 505(b)(2) applicant within 45 days of the patent certification notice to prevent FDA approval until the earlier of a court decision favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant or the expiration of 30 months. The regulations governing marketing exclusivity and patent protection are complex, and it is often unclear how they will be applied in particular circumstances. 
 In addition, both before and after approval is sought, we are required to comply with a number of FDA requirements. For example, we are required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with certain limitations and other requirements concerning advertising and promotion 
 
18 


  for our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to continuing GMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with continuing GMP. In addition, the discovery of problems, such as safety problems, may result in changes in labeling or restrictions on a product manufacturer or NDA holder, including removal of the product from the market. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. A sponsor may request orphan drug designation of a previously unapproved drug, or of a new indication for an already marketed drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before an NDA is submitted. If the FDA grants orphan drug designation, which it may not, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan status are publicly disclosed by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey an advantage in or shorten the duration of, the review and approval process. If a drug which has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the drug is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, unless the subsequent application is able to demonstrate clinical superiority in efficacy or safety or that it represents a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for that indication, or the same drug for other indications. 
 We received orphan drug designations for Lipoquin for the management of cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in the U.S. We requested orphan drug designation from the FDA for Linhaliq for the management of bronchiectasis, and in June 2011 we were granted orphan drug designation for ciprofloxacin for inhalation (which includes Linhaliq) for this indication. In June 2012, we received orphan drug designation in the U.S. for liposomal ciprofloxacin plus ciprofloxacin (i.e., Linhaliq) for cystic fibrosis. 
 We may seek orphan drug designation for other eligible product candidates we develop. However, our inhaled ciprofloxacin may not receive orphan drug marketing exclusivity. Also, it is possible that our competitors could obtain approval, and attendant orphan drug designation or exclusivity, for products that would preclude us from marketing our inhaled ciprofloxacin for these indications for some time. 
 Foreign regulatory authorities may also provide for orphan drug designations in countries outside the United States. For example, under European guidelines, Orphan Medicinal Product Designation provides 10 years of potential market exclusivity if the product candidate is the first product candidate for the indication approved for marketing in the EU. Orphan drug designation also allows the candidates sponsor to seek assistance from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in optimizing the candidates clinical development through participation in designing the clinical protocol and preparing the marketing application. Additionally, a drug candidate designated by the Commission as an Orphan Medicinal Product may qualify for a reduction in regulatory fees as well as an EU-funded research grant. 
 In August 2009, the EMA granted Orphan Drug Designation to our inhaled liposomal ciprofloxacin drug product candidate Lipoquin (ARD-3100) for the management of lung infections associated with cystic fibrosis. 
 International Regulation 
 We are also subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials, product manufacturing, marketing and product sales. Our ability to market and sell our products in countries outside the United States will depend upon receiving marketing authorization(s) from appropriate regulatory authorities. We will only be permitted to commercialize our products in a foreign country if the appropriate regulatory authority is satisfied that we have presented adequate evidence of safety, quality, and efficacy. Whether or not FDA approval has been 
 
19 


  obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in those countries. Approval of a product by the FDA does not assure approval by foreign regulators. Regulatory requirements, and the approval process vary widely from country to country, and the time, cost and data needed to secure approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The regulatory approval and oversight process in other countries includes all of the risks associated with the FDA process described above. 
 Principal Supplier 
 We currently contract exclusively with Exelead (formerly known as Sigma-Tau PharmaSource, Inc.) to manufacture inhaled ciprofloxacin. However, we are exploring developing a second source to manufacture inhaled ciprofloxacin. For more information on the risks associated with this arrangement, please see Item 1ARisk FactorsWe have limited manufacturing capacity and will have to depend on contract manufacturers and collaborators; if they do not perform as expected, our revenues and customer relations will suffer. 
Research and Development 
 Our research and development expenses were approximately $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

 We have assembled a scientific advisory board comprised of scientific and product development advisors who provide expertise, on a consulting basis from time to time, in the areas of respiratory diseases, pharmaceutical development and drug delivery, including pulmonary delivery, but are employed elsewhere on a full-time basis. As a result, they can only spend a limited amount of time on our affairs. We access scientific and medical experts in academia, as needed, to support our scientific advisory board. The scientific advisory board assists us on issues related to potential product applications, product development, and clinical testing. Its members, and their affiliations and areas of expertise include: 

Name | Affiliation | Area of Expertise 
Stephen J. Farr, Ph.D. | Zogenix, Inc. | Pulmonary Delivery/Pharmaceutics 
Adam Wanner, M.D. | University of Miami | Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD)

 In addition to our scientific advisory board, for certain indications and programs, we assemble groups of experts to assist us on issues specific to such indications and programs. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had twenty-three employees. Sixteen employees are involved in research and development, and product development and seven employees are involved in finance and administration. Eight employees have advanced scientific degrees. 
 Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement. 
 We also utilize an international network of consultants and contractors, such as clinical research organizations (CROs), clinical manufacturing organizations (CMOs) and various specialists in areas, such as regulatory affairs and business and corporate development.
