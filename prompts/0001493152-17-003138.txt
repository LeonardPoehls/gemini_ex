Our Business
 
We are a life sciences company devoting substantially all of our efforts to developing safe anti-inflammatory dietary supplements and drugs. We are initially focusing on astaxanthin, which is a powerful and safe naturally occurring anti-inflammatory without the side effects of currently marketed anti-inflammatories. The safety and efficacy of our products have not been directly evaluated in clinical trials or confirmed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA.
 
Many anti-inflammatories have significant safety risks and side effects that limit their chronic use. We believe that our ability to develop and commercialize astaxanthin and related products should provide us with a competitive advantage through a novel approach that combines robust efficacy with safety, oral bioavailability, and tissue selectivity.
 
Strategic Alliances
 
We intend to expand our capabilities for the development, manufacturing, formulation, marketing and distribution or other exploitation of products based on our proprietary technologies by entering into one or more strategic alliances with companies that have established capabilities.

In November 2006, we entered into a Joint Development and Supply Agreement (the “BASF Agreement”) with BASF, relating to the research, development, manufacture, commercialization and related matters, and the related intellectual property rights with respect to consumer health or “nutraceutical” and pharmaceutical products containing or utilizing synthetically manufactured astaxanthin in the geometric (trans) and optical (S,S’) isomeric form most prevalent in nature (“ASTX-1”), which is the same geometric and optical isomeric form of astaxanthin found in GRAS-designated microalgal astaxanthin products. Under the BASF Agreement, we have granted BASF an exclusive worldwide license to our rights related to the development and commercialization and related obligations of consumer health products containing or utilizing ASTX-1 (“BASF Astaxanthin Products”). This license will provide us with potential benefits including specified royalties for future net sales of BASF Astaxanthin Products, from and after the development and manufacture and applicable regulatory approval of any such BASF Astaxanthin Products. The BASF Agreement does not prohibit Cardax from purchasing BASF Astaxanthin Products for consumer health applications and provides that BASF will manufacture and supply Cardax on a mutually exclusive basis with preclinical, clinical, and commercial scale amounts of ASTX-1 for pharmaceutical applications. The BASF Agreement is subject to certain termination rights of the parties. If any termination is a result of the non-renewal of the then current term of the agreement or because BASF no longer manufactures astaxanthin, then the terminating party shall, upon the request of the non-terminating party, grant the non-terminating party a reasonable royalty-bearing, irrevocable, worldwide non-exclusive license of certain intellectual property rights of the terminating party that will enable the non-terminating party to continue the manufacture and distribution of BASF Astaxanthin Products. Either party may also terminate the BASF Agreement if there is a change of a controlling interest in the other party; however, the provision shall not apply if a party that is not a manufacturer of synthetic carotenoids acquires the Company. The BASF Agreement provides for an initial term of three years that is automatically extended for 18 month periods unless notice of termination by either party is provided not less than 18 months prior to the expiration of the current term. Our material benefits under the BASF Agreement, including our rights to royalty payments on future net sales of such products survive any termination in full force. While we are not currently developing any products with BASF, we may pursue development and commercialization with BASF under this Joint Development and Supply Agreement in the future.
 
In August 2014, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement (the “Capsugel Agreement”) with Capsugel US, LLC relating to the commercial development of astaxanthin products for the consumer health market. Under the terms of the Capsugel Agreement, we agreed to jointly develop consumer health products (“Capsugel Astaxanthin Products”) containing ASTX-1 using Capsugel’s proprietary formulation technology. The Capsugel Agreement provides for the joint administration of activities under a product development plan that will include identifying at least one mutually acceptable third-party marketer (a “Marketer”) who will enter into an agreement with Capsugel to further develop, market and distribute Capsugel Astaxanthin Products. The terms of any such agreement with a Marketer are subject to our reasonable consent. The Capsugel Agreement provides that Capsugel shall share revenues with us based on net sales of Capsugel Astaxanthin Products, subject to an administrative fee payable to Capsugel. Capsugel agreed to certain exclusivity obligations with respect to the development and manufacture of Capsugel Astaxanthin Products. Among other matters, Capsugel will perform the development work necessary to formulate, analytically develop and take all other developmental actions necessary or required to develop the Capsugel Astaxanthin Products, and manufacture pre-clinical and clinical batches for use by us and Capsugel. Under the Capsugel Agreement, we will be responsible for, among other matters, the U.S. regulatory process and the regulatory process in non-U.S. jurisdictions to the extent mutually agreed. The term of the Capsugel Agreement is for an initial stated period of three years from the date that a Marketer first offers product for commercial sale under an agreement with Capsugel, subject to specified renewal provisions for additional three year terms and to earlier termination, if commercial milestones that are to be mutually agreed are not achieved. In January 2016, we suspended development of a Capsugel Astaxanthin Product, ASTX-1F, based on certain technical issues which, together with other business and regulatory issues, materially impeded the formulation of ASTX-1F as a commercially viable product for the consumer health market.
 
Our Strategy
 
We believe we are well positioned for significant and sustained growth by focusing on additional research and development to commercialize consumer health and pharmaceutical technologies or products utilizing synthetically manufactured astaxanthin (“Cardax Astaxanthin”) and related xanthophyll carotenoids, which deliver nature-identical compounds to the body and reduce inflammation in a multifaceted, quantifiable, and inherently safer manner than steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (“NSAIDs”).
 
Our initial primary focus is astaxanthin technologies. Astaxanthin is a naturally occurring marine compound that has robust anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity with exceptional safety. Astaxanthin is a member of the carotenoid family, which is comprised of organic pigments that are produced in various plants and photosynthetic organisms and consumed by various higher-level organisms; astaxanthin is known for giving salmon and lobster their distinctive red coloration. More specifically, astaxanthin is classified as a xanthophyll, which is an oxygen containing carotenoid (such as lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycophyll), as compared to a carotene, which is non-oxygen containing carotenoid (such as beta-carotene). Research demonstrates that xanthophylls behave differently than carotenes with respect to biological mechanism of action (for example, by spanning and stabilizing biological membranes rather than disrupting membranes), which we believe translates into clinical benefit. Peer-reviewed studies have shown that astaxanthin reduces inflammation, at its source, without the harmful side effects that are common with other anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical products, for example steroids and NSAIDs, including immune system suppression, liver damage, cardiovascular disease risk, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Astaxanthin has an exceptional safety profile. For example, the FDA found no basis for questioning the safety determination made by Fuji Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (“Fuji”) in GRAS Notice No. GRN 000294 that Haematococcus pluvialis extract containing astaxanthin esters (the primary ingredient in its microalgal astaxanthin consumer health product) is GRAS as a food additive under the intended conditions of use. Other microalgal astaxanthin consumer health manufacturers, including Cyanotech Corporation and Algatechnologies, Ltd., have relied on Fuji’s GRAS designation and self-affirmed their microalgal astaxanthin products as GRAS. The FDA also found no basis for questioning the safety of microalgal astaxanthin products, for use as dietary ingredients in dietary supplements, in several New Dietary Ingredient (NDI) notifications, including RPT 50, RPT 65, RPT 119, RPT 236, RPT 274, and RPT 278. In addition, the FDA amended the color additive regulations under 21 CFR 73 to provide for the safe use of astaxanthin as a color additive to fish feed in 1995 (Federal Register Document No. 95-9178, Docket No. 87C–0316) in response to Color Additive Petition CAP 7C0211 filed by Hoffman-La Roche in 1987, which contained robust non-clinical safety studies with a racemic mixture of synthetic astaxanthin (“DSM Astaxanthin”) now owned by DSM Nutritional Products Ltd. (“DSM”). DSM announced the marketing of DSM Astaxanthin as a consumer health product in 2013 based on its history of use in the food supply as a color additive, the robust non-clinical safety studies that supported the food color additive approval, and additional long term toxicity studies that were submitted to the FDA in 2005. DSM also announced the GRAS self-affirmation of DSM Astaxanthin in 2015. Our claim that astaxanthin is exceptionally safe relies upon:
 

● | widely available astaxanthin research, peer-reviewed studies, and regulatory filings spanning several decades, including (a) FDA GRAS and NDI regulatory filings related to microalgal astaxanthin and other naturally-occurring sources of astaxanthin, (b) FDA color additive petition related to the racemic mixture of synthetic astaxanthin, (c) DSM’s published safety summary supporting the use of DSM Astaxanthin as a dietary ingredient in dietary supplements, and (d) DSM’s GRAS self-affirmation of DSM Astaxanthin; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | human exposure to (a) naturally-occurring astaxanthin in the diet from sources such as wild salmon, trout, and shell-fish, for millennia, (b) synthetic astaxanthin from sources such as industrially raised salmon since 1995, and (c) dietary supplements containing naturally-occurring astaxanthin since 1999; and 
● | our published and unpublished preliminary non-clinical studies utilizing astaxanthin product candidates. 

 
In humans, astaxanthin has been found in publicly available research studies to lower important inflammatory and metabolic disease measures such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (“TNF-α”), high-sensitivity complement reactive protein (“hsCRP”), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (“LDL-C”), apolipoprotein B (“ApoB”), and triglycerides while raising adiponectin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (“HDL-C”). Astaxanthin has also positively affected markers of oxidative stress in humans including isoprostanes, malondialdehyde (“MDA”), total anti-oxidant capacity (“TAC”), and superoxide dismutase (“SOD”). Astaxanthin and related esters have demonstrated efficacy in models of inflammatory-mediated disease including reduction of TNF-α levels equivalent to a steroid, reduction of liver enzymes and liver histological damage, reduction of cholesterol levels, reduction of elevated triglycerides, decrease of atheroma formation, reduction of oxidized-LDL levels, reduction in blood clot formation with no increase in bleeding, and decrease in myocardial tissue damage following experimentally-induced myocardial infarction.
 
We believe that the current manufacturing capability of astaxanthin producers utilizing microalgal or other natural manufacturing processes may not satisfy the growing demand for astaxanthin and there will be a need for the synthetic production of nature-identical astaxanthin with high purity at economical costs.
 
We plan to promote scientific understanding of astaxanthin through several strategies, including:
 

● | educating physicians and other healthcare professionals on the benefits of astaxanthin; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | sponsoring relevant scientific and medical conferences and presenting or facilitating the presentation of appropriate scientific data to physicians, key opinion leaders, and patient groups; 
● | advancing direct-to-consumer internet and social media marketing; 
● | continuing to support scientific research and publication of peer-reviewed papers; we have collaborated on more than 50 such papers, including 10 papers published in The American Journal of Cardiology, which have noted the benefits and safety of astaxanthin in the treatment of diseases that have inflammation as a common cause; 
● | convening scientific advisory board meetings to review existing and planned scientific research, with scientific advisory board members including, but not limited to, persons previously engaged by our predecessors, in the areas of osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease, and liver disease; and 
● | conducting human clinical trials. 

 
While the FDA does not require human clinical trials for consumer health products, and under applicable regulations we are not permitted to make claims for treatment of diseases for any consumer health products, we believe that positive results from a Phase I human clinical trial and a suite of approximately three to five Phase II human clinical trials in select disease areas of major unmet medical need would significantly raise scientific and consumer awareness that would promote consumer health sales and advance our pharmaceutical development program.

Our Consumer Health Program
 
On August 24, 2016, we launched our first commercial product, ZanthoSyn™. On January 25, 2017, we began selling ZanthoSyn™ to GNC stores in Hawaii on a wholesale basis.
 
ZanthoSyn™ is marketed as a novel astaxanthin dietary supplement with superior absorption and purity. We are using e-commerce and wholesale as our primary sales channels for ZanthoSyn™.
 
Astaxanthin is a clinically studied ingredient with safe anti-inflammatory activity that supports joint health, cardiovascular health, metabolic health, and liver health. The form of astaxanthin utilized in ZanthoSyn™ has demonstrated excellent safety in peer-reviewed published studies and is designated as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) according to FDA regulations.
 
Our ZanthoSyn™ product manufacturing process relies on certain third-party suppliers and this dependence creates several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality, and delivery schedules. In addition, any supply interruption could materially harm our ability to manufacture ZanthoSyn™ until a new source of supply is obtained on acceptable terms. We may be unable to find such other sources in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
As a second generation product candidate, we are developing CDX-085, our patented astaxanthin derivative, which could reduce the size/number of capsules or tablets required to achieve equivalent circulating levels of astaxanthin.
 
Our Planned Pharmaceutical Program
 
We believe that a pharmaceutical program will increase our revenue opportunities. A pharmaceutical product would enable the delivery of astaxanthin with an FDA approved over-the-counter drug (“OTC”) label for disease treatment at consumer-appropriate doses and/or an FDA approved prescription drug (“Rx”) label for disease treatment at physician-recommended doses, and should support increased market penetration. We have patents covering pharmaceutical compositions of astaxanthin esters, allowing us to transition an astaxanthin consumer health product into a pharmaceutical product following requisite clinical trials and FDA approval.
 
We plan to raise additional capital or enter into a strategic collaboration to pursue clinical development of Cardax Astaxanthin. We may choose to undertake the following actions upon certain events including if Cardax Astaxanthin obtains all applicable regulatory approvals or designations necessary for marketing as a consumer health product:
 

● | file an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) with the FDA; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | conduct a Phase I human clinical trial to expand clinical dosing of Cardax Astaxanthin beyond that of the approved consumer health dose of Cardax Astaxanthin; and 
● | conduct three to five Phase II human clinical trials, with a range of doses in areas of major consumer health and/or unmet medical need. 

 
This strategy would offer more than one potential avenue of development and mitigate the risks, including “binary events,” associated with single indication development. We may appropriately augment our management team to pursue this strategy.
 
If any of the lower doses of Cardax Astaxanthin tested in our planned Phase II human clinical trials demonstrate robust safety and efficacy in an area of major consumer health need and are less than or equal to the currently approved consumer health dose of Cardax Astaxanthin, we may decide to conduct pivotal Phase III trials and file a 505(b)(1) or 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (“NDA”) to obtain an OTC label for “low-dose” Cardax Astaxanthin (“OTC-ASTX”). Post-approval clinical studies could also be conducted to expand the label and/or dose. OTC-ASTX may be initially targeted for light-to-moderate osteoarthritis or the onset of other inflammatory disorders. Marketing and distribution of OTC-ASTX could be conducted through global consumer health companies or global pharmaceutical companies under license from Cardax, or through any other strategic relationship that we find acceptable.

If any of the higher doses of Cardax Astaxanthin tested in any such Phase II human clinical trials demonstrate robust safety and efficacy in an area of major unmet medical need, then we may decide to conduct pivotal Phase III trials and file a 505(b)(1) NDA to obtain an Rx label for “high-dose” Cardax Astaxanthin (“Rx-ASTX”). Rx-ASTX may be initially targeted for moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, cognitive decline, metabolic disease, dyslipidemia, or diabetes. Post-approval clinical studies could also be conducted to expand the initial label. Other potential indications driven by oxidative stress and inflammation include, but are not limited to, hepatitis, atherosclerosis, and recurrent thrombosis. Marketing and distribution of Rx-ASTX could be conducted through global pharmaceutical companies under license from Cardax.
 
Astaxanthin Disease Applications, Mechanism of Action, and Safety
 
Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress drive “inflammation syndrome” and “metabolic syndrome,” which are manifested in the form of multifactorial symptomatic disease, and redound to the treatment of many apparently distinct yet interconnected disorders at their inflammatory source with a safe and effective product such as astaxanthin.
 
Cardax Astaxanthin products deliver astaxanthin to the circulation. In the case of CDX-085, the novel astaxanthin ester cleaves in the gut and delivers non-esterified astaxanthin to the circulation. Microalgal astaxanthin consumer health products are comprised of a mixture of naturally occurring astaxanthin esters that also cleave in the gut and deliver non-esterified astaxanthin to the circulation. Non-esterified astaxanthin, as can be delivered by Cardax Astaxanthin, microalgal astaxanthin products, or other astaxanthin products, can be measured in blood and tissues and is generally recognized to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects and exceptional safety found in animals and humans following administration of astaxanthin products. For the purpose of discussing astaxanthin disease applications, mechanism of action, safety, and supporting scientific studies, whether examining non-esterified astaxanthin, naturally occurring astaxanthin esters, or novel astaxanthin esters, we refer to these products as “astaxanthin.”
 
Astaxanthin for Arthritis
 
We believe that there is a large potential market for osteoarthritis treatment. We estimate that there are more than 150 million people in developed nations that suffer from osteoarthritis who have the financial ability to pay for treatment through astaxanthin products. Assuming $1 per day for treatment, the potential market could exceed $50 billion annually. Recent expenditures for treatment of arthritis are also substantial. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the “CDC”) report that the amount of direct medical expenditures in the United States for arthritis and other rheumatic conditions for 2003 was $80.8 billion. Drugs.com noted that aggregate U.S. sales of the top three injected TNF-α inhibitors totaled more than $12 billion in 2012. New oral anti-inflammatory drugs may also be approved, further increasing the amount expended for drug treatment. We expect that these drugs will be based on steroid, NSAID, or enzyme/receptor technologies that could pose significant side effects when administered chronically. In contrast, astaxanthin, at very low doses, reduces TNF-α in humans. In non-human tests, astaxanthin reduces TNF-α equivalent to a corticosteroid—considered to be the most potent of the anti-inflammatory compounds—as well as other important mediators of inflammation including hsCRP, prostaglandin E2 (“PGE-2”), interleukin 6 (“IL-6”), nuclear factor kappa B (“NF-κB”), and nitric oxide (“NO”). We believe that no evidence of the immunosuppressive effects of steroids or TNF-α inhibitors has been seen in multiple animal or human studies using astaxanthin. In fact, in animals, astaxanthin administration is statistically significantly associated with fewer infections.
Astaxanthin for Cognitive Decline
 
According to the CDC, the number of U.S. adults aged 65 or older will more than double by 2030. As the percentage of elderly in the population continues to increase, the prevalence of diseases resulting in cognitive decline may be also expected to increase. While the underlying cause of cognitive decline still remains to be fully elucidated, many studies support the important pathophysiological role of oxidative stress and inflammation, particularly in both Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Further, epidemiological studies support a relationship between brain carotenoids (i.e., a class of related natural compounds including astaxanthin) and cognitive performance. Measurable amounts of carotenoids have also been found in the human brain and are reported to be significantly lower in the brain of Alzheimer’s disease patients. Most importantly, a recently conducted, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human clinical trial supported the potential for astaxanthin to improve cognitive function in an elderly population afflicted with age-related forgetfulness. The trial was conducted with astaxanthin doses comparable to current consumer health product doses. The development of an astaxanthin based anti-inflammatory approach to aid in cognitive decline represents potential treatment for an expanding population with few options to help slow progression or delay onset of these diseases.
Astaxanthin for Metabolic Syndrome
 
Metabolic syndrome is a combination of medical disorders that together increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and liver disease. Several pathophysiological features define metabolic syndrome including central obesity, increased triglyceride levels, decreased HDL-C levels, elevated blood pressure, and increased fasting glucose levels. In humans, astaxanthin has been shown to significantly lower triglycerides and increase HDL-C levels. Similarly, in animal models of disease, astaxanthin administration significantly decreased blood pressure, increased HDL-C levels, lowered triglycerides, and decreased fasting glucose levels. In addition, decreased levels of the metabolic regulator adiponectin are associated with dysfunction of critical signaling pathways that control glucose production and uptake, triglyceride production and distribution, and mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Astaxanthin has been shown in human and animal studies to significantly increase levels of adiponectin with the inference that restoration of adiponectin function is key to remediation of metabolic syndrome physiology. These studies underscore the potential for astaxanthin treatment to ameliorate the majority of physiological measures defining metabolic syndrome and thereby decrease the risk of ensuing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and liver disease.

Astaxanthin for Triglyceride Reduction
 
Certain therapies for the reduction of triglycerides have issues of safety or convenience. Astaxanthin, however, has been shown to reduce elevated triglycerides in a multi-faceted, quantifiable, and safer manner. Fibric acid derivatives exhibit risks of adverse effects when used in combination with statins. Newer drugs such as purified derivatives of the omega-3 fatty acids must be taken at very high doses and some increase LDL-C concomitant with induced liver stress. In contrast, astaxanthin not only shows significant triglyceride and LDL-C lowering capability, at much lower, more manageable doses, but it also lowers key markers of inflammation such as TNF-α and raises HDL-C and adiponectin in humans.
Astaxanthin for Type 2 Diabetes
 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (“T2DM”) is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic high blood glucose in the context of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. The rate of T2DM has increased materially over the last several decades in parallel with obesity. Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, which influence intracellular signaling pathways critical to normal metabolic function, have been shown to play an important role in the pathology of T2DM. Drugs including the highly prescribed Metformin are presumed to act via pathways that regulate glucose production, insulin signaling, and mitochondrial functionality, including AMPK (adiponectin pathway) and PI-3/AKT (insulin receptor pathway). Astaxanthin has also been shown to upregulate adiponectin levels in humans and animal models of metabolic dysfunction and thereby restore AMPK pathway functionality. Additionally, astaxanthin has increased insulin levels, decreased glucose levels, and elevated measures of insulin sensitivity in several animal models of disease. Importantly, signaling pathways that regulate glucose and insulin signaling (PI-3/AKT) are often dysregulated and inhibited by oxidative stress and inflammation. Astaxanthin has been shown to upregulate and normalize these insulin and glucose pathways in animal models resulting in restoration of metabolic homeostasis. The evidence to date supports the potential for astaxanthin to ameliorate causes and symptoms of T2DM in humans.
Astaxanthin for Hepatic Disease
 
While hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus related liver disease continues to be of significant health concern, several metabolism-linked liver diseases currently have significant prevalence including fatty liver disease (“FLD”), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), and alcoholic steatohepatitis (“ASH”). NASH is the inflammatory progression of FLD and threatens to be the leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States. Chronic oxidative stress and inflammation play an important physiological role in the initiation and progression of NASH and ASH, a position supported by the fact that the anti-oxidant vitamin E has recently been shown to decrease liver enzyme levels and, importantly, diminish biopsy-determined liver pathology in the PIVENS trial, underscoring the importance of oxidative stress in NASH pathophysiology. Astaxanthin, which is normally processed and stored in the liver, has been shown in an animal model of liver disease to decrease elevated liver enzymes and diminish histological pathology. Current clinical treatments for NASH include the thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) that appear to act via stimulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (“PPAR-γ”) driven pathways to influence lipid and glucose metabolism. In cell studies, both vitamin E and astaxanthin also exhibit PPAR-γ activating capacities. The importance of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress on NASH and ASH pathological progression underscores the potential influence of astaxanthin to ameliorate liver disease in humans.
Astaxanthin for Atherosclerosis
 
Atherosclerosis is a syndrome affecting arterial blood vessels resulting from chronic inflammation and the accumulation of macrophages and LDL without adequate removal of fats and cholesterol by HDL. In addition to chronic inflammation, chronic oxidative and nitrosative stress also play a significant role in the disease via oxidation and dysregulation of LDL and HDL particles. Astaxanthin has been shown to significantly decrease LDL-C and ApoB levels, increase HDL-C, and decrease TNF-α in humans. Likewise, astaxanthin has been shown to significantly decrease total cholesterol and LDL-C levels and increased HDL-C levels in several animal models of disease. Astaxanthin has been shown to decrease atheroma formation in a diet-driven atherogenesis animal model as well as decrease several measures of LDL oxidation. The effect of astaxanthin on HDL and LDL functionality is understandable because astaxanthin is naturally located within HDL and LDL particles for distribution systemically. An important source of oxidative stress affecting HDL and LDL particles in humans is myeloperoxidase (“MPO”) and astaxanthin has been shown to significantly decrease MPO activity in animals. Astaxanthin was also shown in a cell-based study to increase cholesterol efflux from macrophages, a function that would drastically aid in reduction of atherosclerotic disease. These observations underscore the potential importance of astaxanthin in treatment of atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular diseases.

Astaxanthin for Thrombosis
 
Rethrombosis is a major risk for people who have had acute coronary syndrome or an ischemic stroke. The goal of therapy following thrombosis is to maintain arterial patency and to preserve the area of reduced perfusion in the heart or the brain. Following a thrombotic stroke, for example, the re-occlusion, or rethrombosis rate, is high, estimated at 30% overall in the first 30 days. A majority of the re-occlusive events occur within the initial 7-10 days post-treatment. While therapies targeting stroke and in particular brain salvage (i.e., neuroprotection) have had limited clinical success, we believe that prevention of the reformation of blood clots, or rethrombosis, is a novel and relatively efficient pathway to demonstrate feasibility for human use and to an eventual FDA approval for this indication. Lysing blood clots has already proven helpful with tissue plasminogen activator (“tPA”) and other thrombolytic agents, and prevention of rethrombosis can be measured in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful way. In several animal studies of thrombosis and rethrombosis, astaxanthin administration has been shown to demonstrate robust efficacy with no change in bleeding times.
 
Consistent with other astaxanthin disease applications, oxidative stress and inflammation play major roles in the pathophysiology of rethrombosis. While we plan to focus initially on arthritis, cognitive decline, and metabolic dysfunction, we remain very interested in areas such as rethrombosis and related platelet aggregation following an ischemic stroke, where animal models have been particularly predictive of human efficacy.
 
Astaxanthin Mechanism of Action
 
Following oral administration of astaxanthin and intestinal uptake, astaxanthin is delivered initially to the liver via chylomicrons and subsequently distributed to tissues throughout the body via plasma lipoprotein particles including very low-density lipoprotein (“VLDL”), HDL, and LDL. Once in the cell, astaxanthin accumulates within various organelles including nuclear, endoplasmic reticulum (“ER”), and mitochondrial membranes. Localization within mitochondria is highly controlled by the cell and allows astaxanthin to uniquely regulate oxidative and nitrosative stress in a privileged location critical to normal metabolic function and often at the heart of metabolic dysfunction and aging. Due to its chemical structure, astaxanthin completely spans the lipid component of cell membranes, facilitating its biphasic (aqueous and lipid) anti-oxidant functions. In support of the unique property of astaxanthin, one study examined X-ray diffraction profiles of five structurally related anti-oxidants embedded in a lipid matrix and demonstrated that each oriented differently with only astaxanthin traversing the lipid, potentially explaining in part why other well-known anti-oxidants, including beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E, have not achieved greater clinical success. In addition to mitochondrial influence, astaxanthin’s aqueous and lipid anti-oxidant functions have the capacity to influence intracellular inflammatory and metabolic pathway signaling because many important intracellular pathways are directly modulated by inflammatory and oxidative stress mediators. In support of strong anti-oxidant function within the body, astaxanthin administration has been shown to demonstrate statistically significant anti-oxidant capacity in humans as measured by decreased isoprostanes, decreased MDA levels, increased TAC, and increased SOD, as well as decreased lipid peroxidation. Likewise, numerous animal studies have supported the extensive and powerful anti-oxidant capacity of astaxanthin in vivo. Many studies support the strong influence of astaxanthin on mitochondrial functionality, as well as inflammatory and metabolic intracellular signaling in animals and in cell-based models.
 
Astaxanthin Anti-Inflammatory Comparison to Steroids and NSAIDs
 
Glucocorticoid steroids and NSAIDs act mechanistically to trans-repress and reduce many inflammatory pathways/mediators including but not restricted to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin one beta (IL-1β), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), interleukin six (IL-6), prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), monocyte chemoattractant protein one (MCP-1), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). Astaxanthin has been shown in humans, animal models and cell systems to act upon and inhibit/reduce many of the same inflammatory mediators affected by glucocorticoid steroids and NSAIDs. Although Cardax’s particular astaxanthin product candidates have not been tested in human clinical studies, the following statements are based on relevant data derived from human/animal/cell system studies conducted using microalgal and synthetic astaxanthin sources. Importantly, administration of astaxanthin to humans reduced the inflammatory mediator TNF-α in an open label study and decreased C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. More specifically, in animal models and cell culture systems, administration of astaxanthin reduced several markers of inflammation overlapping with glucocorticoid steroid targets. In particular, astaxanthin has been shown to significantly reduce TNF-α, IL-1β, NF-κB, IL-6, PGE-2, MCP-1, ERK, JNK, iNOS, and COX-2. In one comparative animal study, astaxanthin and prednisolone showed quantitatively equivalent efficacy by significantly reducing TNF-α and PGE-2 levels an equal amount when administered at equivalent doses.

Safety
 
Safety is a critical aspect of drug development in the current regulatory environment. Many anti-inflammatory drugs target highly specific biological enzymes or receptors such as cyclooxygenase 2 (“COX-2”), TNF-α, and C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (“CCR2”). While these natural targets play a significant role in inflammation, they are also critical components of other important biological pathways. With chronic use of most anti-inflammatory drugs, these pathways may not function normally, resulting in adverse side effects. Also, these treatments often negatively affect other crucial biological systems, creating additional off-target side effects.
 
In contrast, astaxanthin safely reduces inflammation at its source, in that it:
 

● | localizes in the plasma, mitochondrial, and nuclear membranes; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | scavenges or quenches the unwanted initiators and effectors of inflammation—reactive oxygen (“ROS”) and nitrogen species (“RNS”); and 
● | demonstrates no evidence of the immunosuppressive effects of steroids or TNF-α inhibitors or off-target effects (e.g., receptor or pathway). 

Our Other Programs
 
We have two other anti-inflammatory programs with potential applications in large markets that are in development: zeaxanthin esters for macular degeneration and hepatic disease; and lycophyll esters for prostate disease. Both of these product platforms have potential to be developed first as consumer health products and later as pharmaceuticals. We have used a limited amount of synthetic zeaxanthin in our preliminary research and development efforts. We plan additional research and development to select the optimal zeaxanthin esters for consumer health and/or pharmaceutical development through our own capabilities or through a strategic alliance or a manufacturing agreement. We have produced synthetic lycophyll and we plan to conduct additional research and development to first increase our production capabilities of lycophyll and then to select the optimal lycophyll esters for consumer health and/or pharmaceutical development through our own capabilities or through a strategic alliance or a manufacturing agreement.
Research and Development
 
Our research and development program is presently comprised of employees, consultants, including regulatory, scientific, and medical professionals, and third-party collaborators or contract organizations, including academic institutions, contract research organizations, and contract manufacturing organizations. We utilized dedicated internal synthetic chemistry, biology, and bioanalytical chemistry laboratories and a research and development staff to conduct discovery stage synthesis of product candidates (with transfer of materials and/or methods for additional process development and/or testing), in vitro testing of product candidates and related components to elucidate the mechanism of action, and analysis of biological samples from internal research and/or contract organizations to detect and quantify levels of product candidates and related components following administration of product in various studies. Our research and development staff has also worked with other professionals to identify, contract and transfer materials and methods, and oversee research and manufacturing by contract organizations. Contract organizations provide us with access to larger scale manufacturing, animal studies of disease, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity, and analysis that would not otherwise be available to us without significant expense. We anticipate that the majority of our research and development will be conducted by contract organizations with direction and oversight by our current internal research and development personnel, including two Ph.D. scientists, two Ph.D. scientific executives, one operational executive, and one M.D. consultant.
 
In addition to conducting or overseeing research and development activities, our research and development personnel analyze and interpret other research on astaxanthin, as well as related compounds, competing products, applicable disease pathology, and industry trends. In the United States National Library of Medicine’s online repository, PubMed.gov, there are more than 1,400 peer-reviewed journal articles that reference astaxanthin in the title or abstract, over 400 of which were published in the last three years, with the vast majority published by organizations and researchers that are not affiliated with us. This type of “open-source” research has served to significantly advance the understanding of astaxanthin, and has also presented our research and development personnel with the critical task of keeping up-to-date on all of the latest research and interpreting and integrating the findings with our research and that of others in order to serve as the preeminent thought leaders on astaxanthin’s mechanism of action and its application in biological systems and disease areas.

Our research and development expenditures totaled $347,885 and $491,829 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. These expenditures primarily reflect the compensation of our research and development personnel and product development activities.
 
Government Regulation
 
Most aspects of our business are subject to some degree of government regulation. For some of our products, government regulation is significant and, in general, there appears to be a trend toward more stringent regulation throughout the world, as well as global harmonization of various regulatory requirements. We expect to devote significant time, effort and expense to address the extensive government and regulatory requirements applicable to our business. We believe that we are no more or less adversely affected by existing government regulations than our competitors.
 
FDA Regulation
 
Pharmaceutical companies must comply with comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and comparable authorities in other countries. While the FDA does not require human clinical trials for consumer health products, we may conduct Phase I, Phase II, and/or Phase III clinical trials with our products.
 
We must obtain regulatory approvals by the FDA and, to the extent we have any international distribution of our products, foreign government agencies prior to human clinical testing and commercialization of any pharmaceutical product and for post-approval clinical studies for additional indications in approved drugs. We anticipate that any pharmaceutical product candidate will be subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and pre-market approval procedures by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries to the extent applicable. The extent to which our products are regulated by the FDA, and the designations applicable to our products, will depend upon the types of products we ultimately develop. We are currently evaluating other product developments or technologies to pursue and cannot predict, during this stage of our development, the scope of FDA or other agency regulation to which we or our products and technologies will be subject. Various federal statutes and regulations also govern or influence the preclinical and clinical testing, record-keeping, approval, labeling, manufacture, quality, shipping, distribution, storage, marketing and promotion, export and reimbursement of products and product candidates.
 
The steps ordinarily required before a drug product may be marketed in the United States include:
 

● | preclinical studies; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence; 
● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate in the desired indication for use; 
● | submission of a NDA to the FDA, together with payment of a substantial user fee; and 
● | FDA approval of the NDA, including inspection and approval of the product manufacturing facility and select sites at which human clinical trials were conducted. 

 
Preclinical trials typically involve laboratory evaluation of product candidate chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of each product candidate. The results of preclinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and are reviewed by the FDA before the commencement of clinical trials. Unless the FDA objects to an IND, the IND will become effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA clearance to commence clinical trials, and the FDA’s failure to object to an IND does not guarantee FDA approval of a marketing application.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to humans under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. In the United States, clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices under protocols submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an institutional review board and with the patient’s informed consent. We would be subject to similar protocols and similar regulatory considerations if we conduct clinical trials outside the United States.
 
The goal of Phase I clinical trials is to establish initial data about safety and tolerability of the product candidate in humans. The investigators seek to evaluate the effects of various dosages and to establish an optimal dosage level and schedule.
 
The goal of Phase II clinical trials is to provide evidence about the desired therapeutic efficacy of the product candidate in limited studies with small numbers of carefully selected subjects. Investigators also gather additional safety data.

Phase III clinical trials consist of expanded, large-scale, multi-center studies in the target patient population. This phase further tests the product’s effectiveness, monitors side effects, and, in some cases, compares the product’s effects to a standard treatment, if one is already available. Phase III trials are designed to more rigorously test the efficacy of a product candidate and are normally randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled. Phase III trials are typically monitored by an independent data monitoring committee, or DMC, which periodically reviews data as a trial progresses. A DMC may recommend that a trial be stopped before completion for a number of reasons including safety concerns, patient benefit or futility.
 
Data obtained from this development program are submitted as part of a NDA to the FDA and possibly to corresponding agencies in other countries for review. The NDA requires agency approval prior to marketing in the relevant country. Extensive regulations define the form, content and methods of gathering, compiling and analyzing the product candidate’s safety and efficacy data.
 
The process of obtaining regulatory approval can be costly, time consuming and subject to unanticipated delays. Regulatory agencies may refuse to approve an application if they believe that applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and may also require additional testing for safety and efficacy and/or post-marketing surveillance or other ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies. In some instances, regulatory approval may be granted with the condition that confirmatory Phase IV clinical trials are carried out, and if these trials do not confirm the results of previous studies, regulatory approval for marketing may be withdrawn. Moreover, each regulatory approval of a product is limited to specific indications. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may approve only limited label information for the product. The label information describes the indications and methods of use for which the product is authorized, may include Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies and, if overly restrictive, may limit a sponsor’s ability to successfully market the product. Regulatory agencies routinely revise or issue new regulations, which can affect and delay regulatory approval of product candidates.
 
Furthermore, pharmaceutical manufacturing processes must conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs. Manufacturers, including a drug sponsor’s third-party contract manufacturers, must expend time, money and effort in the areas of production, quality control and quality assurance, including compliance with stringent record-keeping requirements. Manufacturing establishments are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA or other health authorities, in order to assess, among other things, compliance with cGMP. Before approval of the initiation of commercial manufacturing processes, the FDA will usually perform a preapproval inspection of the facility to determine its compliance with cGMP and other rules and regulations. In addition, foreign manufacturing establishments must also comply with cGMPs in order to supply products for use in the United States, and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA or by regulatory authorities in certain countries under reciprocal agreements with the FDA. Manufacturing processes and facilities for pharmaceutical products are highly regulated. Regulatory authorities may choose not to certify or may impose restrictions, or even shut down existing manufacturing facilities that they determine are non-compliant.
 
FDA GRAS Determination
 
“GRAS” is an acronym for the phrase “generally recognized as safe,” which the FDA utilizes to describe those substances that, in the generally recognized opinion of the scientific community, will not be harmful to consumers, provided the substance is used as intended. According to applicable FDA regulations, any substance that is intentionally added to food is a food additive, which is subject to premarket review and approval by FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized, among qualified experts, as having been adequately shown to be safe under the conditions of its intended use. Under sections 201(s) and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”), and FDA’s implementing regulations in 21 CFR 170.3 and 21 CFR 170.30, the use of a food substance may be GRAS either through scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food. General recognition of safety through scientific procedures requires the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of the substance as a food additive and ordinarily is based upon published studies, which may be corroborated by unpublished studies and other data and information. General recognition of safety through experience based on common use in foods requires a substantial history of consumption for food use by a significant number of consumers.
 
Manufacturers of GRAS substances may provide the FDA with a notification of GRAS determination, which includes a description of the substance, the applicable conditions of use, and an explanation of how the substance was determined to be safe. Upon review of such a notification, the FDA may respond with a “no questions” position, whereby the manufacturer’s determination that a product is GRAS for its intended purposes is affirmed. Alternatively, manufacturers may elect to “self-affirm” a given substance as GRAS without FDA notification but should retain all applicable safety data used for GRAS determination in the case of FDA inquiry.

Synthetic copies of naturally-occurring dietary ingredients or related components do not qualify as dietary ingredients under the FD&C Act, but substances that have been affirmed by the FDA as GRAS, self-affirmed as GRAS, or approved as direct food additives in the U.S. may be marketed as dietary ingredients, subject to FDA regulations for dietary ingredients.
 
FDA NDI Notification
 
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (the “DSHEA”) (Pub. L. 103-417) was signed into law on October 25, 1994 and amended the FD&C Act by adding: (i) section 201(ff) (21 U.S.C. 321(ff)), which defines the term “dietary supplement”, and (ii) section 413 (21 U.S.C. 350b), which defines the term “new dietary ingredient” (“NDI”) and requires the manufacturer or distributor of an NDI, or of the dietary supplement that contains the NDI, to submit a premarket notification to FDA at least 75 days before introducing/delivering the supplement into interstate commerce, unless the NDI and any other dietary ingredients in the dietary supplement have been present in the food supply without chemical alteration (21 U.S.C. 350b(a)(1)). The NDI notification must contain applicable information, including history of use and citations to published articles, from which the manufacturer or distributor of the NDI or dietary supplement has concluded that the dietary supplement containing the NDI will be reasonably expected to be safe under the conditions of its intended use. NDI notifications are not required for the marketing of approved food additives or GRAS substances as NDIs unless the dietary ingredient has been chemically altered.
Hawaii Tax Credit
 
For tax years 2006 to 2010, our predecessor received an aggregate amount of $1,262,117 in refundable tax credits from the State of Hawaii – Department of Taxation in connection with qualified research expenditures in the State of Hawaii. The Hawaii Tax Credit for Research Activities (“HTCRA”) was intended to encourage taxpayers to design, develop, and/or improve products, processes, techniques, formulas or software and intended to reward programs that pursue innovation in the State of Hawaii. The HTCRA was discontinued by the State of Hawaii for tax years 2011 and 2012, but was made available again starting in tax year 2013 with certain modifications to the qualification and credit calculations.
Other Regulations
 
Pharmaceutical companies, including us, are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback and false claims laws. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Some of the state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 
In the course of practicing medicine, physicians may legally prescribe FDA approved drugs for an indication that has not been approved by the FDA and which, therefore, is not described in the product’s approved labeling, so-called “off-label use.” The FDA does not ordinarily regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA and other governmental agencies do, however, restrict communications on the subject of off-label use by a manufacturer or those acting on behalf of a manufacturer. Companies may not promote FDA-approved drugs for off-label uses. The FDA and other governmental agencies do permit a manufacturer (and those acting on its behalf) to engage in some limited, non-misleading, non-promotional exchanges of scientific information regarding unapproved indications. The United States False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, anyone from knowingly and willfully presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including imprisonment, fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as possible exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). In addition, under this and other applicable laws, such as the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, there is an ability for private individuals to bring similar actions. Further, there is an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the law.
 
We are subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, withdraw approvals, enjoin violations and institute criminal prosecution, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We must comply with regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and other federal, state and local regulations. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain hazardous or potentially hazardous materials. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, including, but not limited to, certain hazardous chemicals.
 
Our activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. We are also subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits companies and individuals from engaging in specified activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. Under the FCPA, it is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, governmental staff members, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. In addition, federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain health information, in particular, individually identifiable information, and restrict the use and disclosure of that information. At the federal level, the Department of Health and Human Services promulgated health information privacy and security rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. In addition, many state laws apply to the use and disclosure of health information.
 
Competition
 
The industry in which we intend to compete is subject to intense competition. We believe that our ability to compete will be dependent in large part upon our ability to continually enhance and improve our products and technologies. In order to do so, we plan to effectively utilize and expand our research and development capabilities. Competition is based primarily on scientific and technological superiority, technical support, availability of patent protection, protection of trade secrets, access to adequate capital, ability to develop, acquire and market products successfully, ability to obtain governmental approvals and ability to serve the particular needs of customers. We intend to compete on the basis of safety, effectiveness, convenience, manufacturing superiority, intellectual property, and where appropriate, price.
 
Because of the broad manifestation of inflammation in chronic disease, numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are developing or producing anti-inflammatory therapeutic agents. These companies include, but are not limited to: AbbVie, Amgen, Astellas, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eisai, Eli Lilly, Gilead, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, MT Pharma, Nestle/Pamlab, Novartis, Pfizer, Reata, Roche/Genentech, Sanofi-Aventis, Servier, Takeda, Vivus.
 
In addition to competing with non-astaxanthin anti-inflammatory drugs, we intend to compete with microalgal astaxanthin consumer health products on the basis of our global-scale manufacturing capability and product purity. Leading manufacturers of microalgal astaxanthin include Cyanotech, which produces the BioAstin brand; Fuji Health Science (parent company: Fuji Chemical), which produces the AstaREAL brand; and Algatechnologies, which produces the AstaPure brand. Many other companies, including Valensa International (parent company: EID Parry), acquire astaxanthin from these or other smaller manufacturers. We believe that large-scale, multi-fold expansion of naturally produced microalgal astaxanthin would require large amounts of land, and fresh water for open pond systems or large amounts of infrastructure and energy for closed systems, and, consequently, a significant if not overwhelming amount of investment capital. Furthermore, microalgal astaxanthin products, which are lipophilic extracts of a commercially cultivated microalgae, typically have relatively low astaxanthin content, with the majority of the product comprised of other lipophilic, non-astaxanthin microalgal compounds. In contrast, our synthetically manufactured astaxanthin products have very high astaxanthin content, with consistent purity. Higher relative astaxanthin content reduces the size/number of capsules or tablets required to achieve equivalent circulating levels of astaxanthin. We may also face competition from other synthetic astaxanthin consumer health products, although competitors in this space are limited by the substantial cost and technical expertise required to develop large-scale, industrial production of astaxanthin.
 
Our success will also depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain international and domestic patent and other legal protections for the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business. We intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for our products where applicable by filing patent applications in the United States and other selected countries. We intend for these patent applications to cover, where applicable, claims for composition of matter, uses, processes for preparation and formulations. Our success will also depend on our ability, and the ability of our current and/or future strategic partners to maintain trade secrets related to proprietary production methods for products that we, or our partners, intend to market.

Raw Materials and Components
 
We utilize strategic partners, contract manufacturers, and/or other third-party suppliers for the production of our products and product candidates. The raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products and product candidates may be available, in some instances from one supplier, and in other instances, from multiple suppliers. In those cases where raw materials are only available through one supplier, such supplier may be either a sole source (the only recognized supply source available to us) or a single source (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We, our strategic partners, contract manufacturers, and/or other third-party suppliers will adopt appropriate policies to attempt, to the extent feasible, to minimize our raw material supply risks, including maintenance of greater levels of raw materials inventory and implementation of multiple raw materials sourcing strategies, especially for critical raw materials. Although to date we have not experienced any significant delays in obtaining any raw materials from suppliers, we cannot provide assurance that we, our strategic partners, contract manufacturers, and/or other third-party suppliers will not face shortages from one or more of them in the future.
Customers
 
In late August 2016, we initiated limited consumer sales of ZanthoSyn™, our first commercial product. On January 25, 2017, we began selling ZanthoSyn™ to GNC stores in Hawaii on a wholesale basis.
Intellectual Property
 
We have obtained and are continuing to seek patent protection for compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and pharmaceutical uses, in certain disease areas, of our various carotenoid analogs and derivatives. Such carotenoids include, but are not limited to, astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, lutein, and/or lycophyll, and esters and other analogs and derivatives of these compounds. More specifically, we seek to protect: (i) the composition of matter of novel carotenoid analogs and derivatives, (ii) pharmaceutical compositions comprising synthetic or natural preparations of novel or natural occurring carotenoid analogs and derivatives, and (iii) the pharmaceutical use of synthetic preparations of novel or naturally occurring carotenoid analogs and derivatives in specific disease areas, including, but not limited to, the treatment of inflammation and related tissue damage, liver disease, and reperfusion injury, as well as the pharmaceutical use of synthetic or natural preparations of novel or natural occurring carotenoid analogs and derivatives for the reduction of platelet aggregation. We intend to enforce and defend our intellectual property rights consistent with our strategic business objectives.
 
We own 21 issued patents, including 14 in the United States and 7 others in China, India, Japan, and Hong Kong, related to the technology described above. These patents will expire during the years of 2023 to 2028, subject to any patent term extensions of the individual patent. We have 5 foreign patent applications pending in Europe, Canada, and Brazil, also related to the technology described above. Of these patents and patent applications, 20 patents and 4 patent applications have coverage related to astaxanthin analogs and derivatives; however, our proprietary technologies and business opportunities are not dependent on any single patent or sub-set of patents—the portfolio, which includes coverage related to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and pharmaceutical uses, as described above, provides the comprehensive coverage that we deem material to our business.
 
Our strategic alliances also provide intellectual property benefits. BASF owns all manufacturing technology related to ASTX-1 developed under the BASF Agreement; however, BASF must exclusively supply ASTX-1 to Cardax for pharmaceutical applications, and in the event BASF becomes unable to supply ASTX-1, we would receive a reasonable royalty-bearing, irrevocable, worldwide non-exclusive license to certain intellectual property rights related to the manufacture of ASTX-1.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this report, we have 5 full-time employees and 3 part-time employees dedicated to our consumer health and pharmaceutical business. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe the relations with our employees are satisfactory.
