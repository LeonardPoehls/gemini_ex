ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
General 
Knoll, Inc. (“Knoll,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”) is a leading manufacturer of commercial and residential furniture, accessories and coverings. We are a constellation of design-driven brands and people working with clients to create inspired modern interiors. Simply stated, we provide the furnishings and materials to help people enjoy their workplaces and homes. Our businesses share a reputation for high-quality and sophistication forming a diversified portfolio that sustain throughout evolving trends and perform throughout business cycles. To the architects and designers we work with, to our clients in the commercial, education, healthcare and government sectors, and to the many consumers we reach, Knoll represents a commitment to innovative solutions and an unmatched heritage of modern design. 
How people live and work is constantly being reshaped by changing technology and lifestyle trends. Our founders, Hans and Florence Knoll, believed in the power of design to enhance people’s lives. Since our founding 80 years ago, Knoll has won a place in iconic settings and in museums worldwide, earning numerous design honors and awards. Today, we have an unsurpassed collection of classic products to introduce, and reintroduce, as well as groundbreaking new designs. We enjoy strong relationships with many of today’s celebrated furniture and industrial designers, and a reputation that attracts talented new designers. Together, we work with customers to create inspired settings for work, education, hospitality and living.
We focus on two distinct “to-the-trade” specifier markets, commercial and residential. Commercial, the largest portion of our business, is where we see strategic opportunities through the expansion of underpenetrated categories and ancillary markets. At the same time, in the residential market, we are expanding further into consumer and decorator channels worldwide. We reach customers primarily through a broad network of independent dealers and distribution partners, our direct sales force, our showrooms, and our online presence.
We manage our business through our reporting segments: Office, Studio, and Coverings. All unallocated expenses are included within Corporate. When we refer to our “Specialty” products or businesses, we are referring collectively to our Studio and Coverings segments.
The Office segment includes a complete range of workplace products that address diverse workplace planning paradigms. These products include systems furniture, seating, storage, tables, desks and KnollExtra® accessories, as well as the international sales of our North American Office products. 
The Studio segment includes: 

KnollStudio® products, including iconic seating, lounge furniture, side, cafe and dining chairs as well as conference, training, dining and occasional tables. 
DatesWeiser, known for its sophisticated meeting and conference tables and credenzas, setting a standard for design, quality and technology integration. 
HOLLY HUNT®, known for high-quality residential furniture, lighting, rugs, textiles and leathers. HOLLY HUNT® includes Vladimir Kagan Design Group (“Vladimir Kagan”), a renowned collection of modern luxury furnishings.
Knoll Europe, which distributes both KnollStudio and Knoll Office products. 

The Coverings segment includes KnollTextiles®, Spinneybeck® (including Filzfelt®), and Edelman® Leather. These businesses provide a wide range of customers with high-quality fabrics, felt, leather and related architectural products. 
The Corporate function represents the accumulation of unallocated costs relating to shared services and general corporate activities including, but not limited to, legal expenses, acquisition expenses, certain finance, human resources, administrative and executive expenses and other expenses that are not directly attributable to an operating segment. Dedicated, direct selling, general and administrative expenses of the segments continue to be included within segment operating profit. As we continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions, the central support of the Corporate function will evolve and grow as well.
For further information regarding our segments see the section below, and Note 20 in the accompanying financial statements.

Strategy
We draw on our constellation of businesses to provide products and designs that meet the needs of our customers. Our offerings range from our classic signature pieces to our ancillary products which include the Rockwell Unscripted collection by The Rockwell Group and in 2018, will include the product portfolio of our most recent acquisition of Muuto; from dramatic fabrics, to Filzfelt architectural products for acoustical control. We solve a variety of needs for each customer, and our goal for each engagement is to maximize the opportunity from the start. To that end, we have undertaken strategic programs to better synchronize our teams and resources to deliver a single compelling customer experience. We also are investing in systems and tools for our dealer partners to make it easier to do business with Knoll. 
Our growth strategy also focuses on specific international markets where we can significantly build our share, such as Canada, Mexico, Europe, the Middle East, and selected underpenetrated areas across the globe where there is a concentration of discerning clients.
Office Segment
Maximizing the sales growth and profitability of Office, our largest segment, has been a continuing priority. With respect to growth in our Office segment, a variety of initiatives will contribute to making this growth possible: broadening our workplace products portfolio; enhancing strategic sales coverage, including a focus on global accounts; and strengthening our Knoll dealer distribution network. At the same time, we aim to increase profitability through operational improvements and investments in our infrastructure. Our lean manufacturing initiative, combined with continued modernization of our facilities, is allowing us to progressively deliver on this goal.
The commercial market has shifted dramatically in the last decade. As clients are readdressing the relationship between individual and collaborative workspaces, they are reducing the footprint of individual workstations and investing in more ancillary furniture. Knoll is committed to maintaining our leadership in open-plan workspaces and private offices, while inventing and innovating new ways for people to work. Our constellation of businesses positions us well to deliver in the evolving work environment, where people choose how and where they work throughout the day, as the traditional boundaries between residential and commercial products blur, and the importance of a total environment outshines any one particular element. 
We are looking beyond traditional office product categories - systems, task seating and storage - to furniture for activity spaces and the in-between spaces where people meet. We believe that our success in our traditional office products gives us an advantage throughout the workplace. As we design new products suited to flexible spaces, we are also responding to demands at different price points with different materials and finishes. Our new Rockwell Unscripted collection, received enthusiastically at the 2016 NeoCon® national industry tradeshow, addresses the idea of a hospitality work experience. Rockwell Unscripted brings a sense of theater and play to the workplace, putting people at the center of the work life experience and creating a warm and welcoming place where people want to be. The collection encompasses six product categories ranging from seating and lounge to architectural walls and storage. It addresses those needs holistically for organizations that seek alternatives to the traditional workspace.
With the evolution from individual workstations to collaborative spaces and ancillary products, Knoll is not only expanding the breadth of our offerings through our constellation of brands but also strengthening our presence in the marketplace. We are continuing to partner with our dealers to ensure our customers understand that Knoll provides not just systems or workstations and work chairs but rather a complete family of complementary ancillary products. Together, we are meeting the demands of our customers while capturing more of their total spend and elevating the profitability of our engagements. 
This approach has served as a catalyst for dealers to invest in their spaces. Their showrooms are becoming extensions of our own, offering not just product showcases but places to find new integrated solutions from all of Knoll, such as Filzfelt architectural solutions and coverings. Dealers help people to understand workplace needs and planning capabilities, and Knoll is providing more of the training and education that helps them add value and increase their profits when they sell Knoll.
Our principal Knoll Office product lines, described below, include systems furniture, seating, storage, tables, desks and KnollExtra® ergonomic accessories. The Office segment comprised approximately 60.3% of our sales in 2017, 62.8% of our sales in 2016, and 62.2% of our sales in 2015.

KnollExtra also includes marker boards, free-standing and mounted LED lighting and other technology support for the changing workplace. 
Studio Segment
Our Studio segment is comprised of KnollStudio, HOLLY HUNT®, KnollEurope and DatesWeiser. The Studio portfolio includes lounge seating; side, cafe and dining chairs; barstools; and training, conference, dining and occasional tables. KnollStudio includes many of our best-known furnishings, making Knoll a renowned source of classic modern and contemporary design. HOLLY HUNT® designs, produces and showcases high quality products such as residential furniture, lighting, rugs, textiles and leathers. Our Knoll Europe business offers products designed specifically for the European market, in addition to many of our popular KnollStudio and Office products. DatesWeiser, designs and produces sophisticated meeting and conference area tables known for high quality and technological integration.
KnollStudio
KnollStudio has a long history of working with celebrated architects and designers from around the world, including Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Marcel Breuer, Harry Bertoia, Eero Saarinen, Isamu Noguchi, Warren Platner, Frank Gehry, Maya Lin, Jens Risom, Richard Schultz, and Kazuhide Takahama. In addition, KnollStudio manufactures a collection of original furniture designs by Florence Knoll. Their iconic designs often draw designers and customers into the larger Knoll constellation of brands.
The KnollStudio strategy is to both maintain and mine revered masterpieces-reintroducing those that were discontinued and are now mid-century classics, and keeping others refreshed and relevant for contemporary audiences. We enrich this heritage by collaborating with such leading contemporary designers as Mark Krusin, Marc Newson and David Adjaye, to create future classics for residential and commercial markets. 
Our principal KnollStudio product lines include seating, lounge furniture, side, café and dining chairs as well as conference, training and occasional tables. While KnollStudio designs represent different viewpoints and eras, they all embrace a modernist aesthetic. As a result, designers can integrate our ensemble of products into harmonious and inspiring settings furnished entirely with Knoll. With the trend towards residentially-inspired workplaces, KnollStudio products have gained cross-over appeal between residential and commercial settings. KnollStudio offers unparalleled quality for workplaces, homes, hotels and restaurants, as well as government and educational institutions.
To expand our audiences, our flagship Knoll Showroom in New York City and our knoll.com website reach retail consumers and designers alike. Our Knoll Space retail sales program brings consumers the best of Knoll furnishings for their home and home office, through more than 50 specialty retailers and e-tailers, with collectively more than 90 locations in the United States and Canada.
PixelTM is one our most recent KnollStudio offerings. Introduced in 2015 as part of the KnollStudio line, Pixel is a comprehensive collection of flexible, architecturally-inspired meeting tables. Its intuitive Pixel Connect system and a patent-pending flip mechanism make it simple to attach, separate and nest tables for various meeting and training applications. Pixel received the 2015 Best of Neocon Gold award in its category. 
Pixel allows access to power wherever needed, offering a range of electrical options and the innovative Pixel Link Power System which makes it easy to connect multiple power centers.

HOLLY HUNT®
As both a premier provider and distributor of furnishings, lighting, textiles and leathers, HOLLY HUNT® significantly expands our reach into the high-end, to-the-trade residential marketplace. Our strategy has been to extend the brand into a broader set of primary markets, opening new showrooms in Dallas, Houston, London and Los Angeles and expanding our product offerings. In 2016, HOLLY HUNT® acquired Vladimir Kagan Design Group, ensuring the legacy of the renowned designer’s iconic products for high profile interiors.
KnollEurope
Our Studio segment includes our KnollEurope business, consisting primarily of KnollStudio products, but drawing on the Knoll portfolio to give our customers a complete office environment. We also offer products designed specifically for the European market, such as the WaTM desk and storage system. Our presence in the European market positions us not only with local clients, but also with international clients who want to maintain their Knoll facility standard across offices worldwide.
DatesWeiser
Our Studio segment includes DatesWeiser which designs, produces, and showcases high-end contemporary conference room and client-facing furniture. DatesWeiser's customers tend to be within the high design luxury markets. DatesWeiser's product offerings are similar in nature to Studio NA, Europe and Holly Hunt and specializes in high-end, quality furniture to fill the luxury market need.
Studio accounted for approximately 30.1% of our sales in 2017, 27.8% of our sales in 2016, and 27.5% of our sales in 2015.
Coverings Segment
Our Coverings segment consists of KnollTextiles, Spinneybeck | FilzFelt, and Edelman Leather. 
KnollTextiles continues to extend its distribution to reach new customers, notably through a KnollTextiles showroom in New York City's D&D building and through the knolltextiles.com website. Our KT Collection of upholstery marries classic modern design for everyday use, in a range of high performance patterns and textures at an affordable price. The company continues to win awards for its design excellence including Best of NeoCon® awards for eleven years running.
Spinneybeck | FilzFelt is expanding from being just a supplier of raw material to being a provider of finished products. The same trends that have been transforming KnollOffice workspaces have created new opportunities for architectural products that offer flexible space divider panels and acoustic control. Spinneybeck has evolved from being an upholstery leather company to being a natural materials company that provides architects and interior designers with architectural and acoustic solutions. Filzfelt 100% wool felt, offered in 63 colors, meets the demand for new and renewable materials, and offers unique properties as an architectural and sound absorbing product. Now we provide not only felt panels, but also the track systems to hang them on, and are exploring innovative new uses of easy-to-install cork tiles for walls or ceilings. Finished architectural products such as these offer the opportunity for more large-scale orders than does upholstery alone. 
Edelman Leather offers beautiful, natural leathers by leveraging its US and London showrooms. Edelman successfully expanded beyond leather coverings in its Edelman showrooms by offering rug furnishings through its distribution partner Ruckstuhl, and in 2016 added Kyle Bunting, a unique Texas manufacturer of handcrafted, one-of-a-kind rugs. We are also developing new leather coverings for the hospitality business, offering quality within the financial constraints of today’s hotels and restaurants. 
The Coverings segment accounted for approximately 9.6% of our sales in 2017, 9.4% of our sales in 2016, and 10.3% of our sales in 2015. 
Product Design and Development 
Our design philosophy and modern perspective reflects a historical commitment to partnering with preeminent industrial designers and architects to commercialize products that meet evolving workplace and residential needs. By combining designers' creative vision with our commitment to innovative materials and technologically advanced processes, we continue to cultivate brand loyalty among target clients. Our enviable history of nurturing the design process fosters strong, lasting relationships that attract the world's leading designers. In addition, these collaborations are consistent with our commitment to a lean organization and incentive-based compensation, by utilizing a variable royalty-based fee as opposed to the fixed costs typically associated with a larger in-house design staff.

Our broad range of research, which explores the connection between workspace design and human behavior; health and performance; and the quality of the user experience, informs our product development initiatives. Our most recent research identified a new way to think about space, referred to as Immersive Planning, and contributed to the development of our most recent product launch - Rockwell Unscripted.
In addition, our Office and Studio segments product development relies upon a New Product Commercialization Process to ensure quality and consistency of our methodology, reducing product development cycle time without sacrificing quality objectives. We use Pro/ENGINEER® solids modeling tools and rapid prototyping technology to compress development cycles and to improve responsiveness to special requests for customized solutions. Working closely with the designers during the early phases of development provides critical focus to yield the most viable products, balancing innovative modern design with practical function. Cross-functional teams are employed for all major development efforts with dedicated leaders who facilitate a seamless flow into manufacturing while aggressively managing cost and schedule opportunities. Increasingly, total environmental impact is factored into product material and manufacturing process decisions. 
Research and development expenses, were $19.2 million for 2017, $21.7 million for 2016, and $20.7 million for 2015.
Sales and Distribution 
We generate sales with our direct sales force and a network of independent dealers, primarily in the Office segment, who jointly market and sell our products. We generally rely on these independent dealers to also provide a variety of important specification, installation and after-market services to our clients. Our dealers generally operate under short-term (one to three year), non-exclusive agreements. Our Studio and Coverings segments market and sell products with their own internal sales force that often work closely with our Office sales force. We also sell our KnollStudio products through a network of independent retailers. HOLLY HUNT and Edelman both operate a network of showrooms to market and sell their products.
Our clients are typically Fortune 1000 companies, governmental agencies and other medium-to-large sized organizations in a variety of industries including financial, legal, accounting, education, healthcare and hospitality. Our Coverings segment also markets and sells products to private aviation, marine and luxury coach industries. Our direct sales force and independent dealers in North America work in close partnership with clients and design professionals to specify distinctive work environments. Our direct sales representatives, in conjunction with the independent dealers, sell to and call directly on key clients. Our independent dealers also call on many other medium and small sized clients to provide seamless sales support and client service. We have an over $11.5 billion installed base of office systems, which provides a strong platform for recurring and add-on sales. “Installed base” refers to the amount of office systems product we have sold in North America during the previous fifteen years. 
Our products and knowledgeable sales force have generated strong brand recognition and loyalty among architects, designers and corporate facility managers, all of whom are key decision-makers in the furniture purchasing process. Our strong relationships with architects and design professionals help us stay abreast of key workplace trends and position us to better meet the changing needs of clients. For example, we have invested in training all of our architect and designer specialists as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED®”) accredited professionals to help clients better address environmental issues that arise in the design of the workplace. 
We have aligned our sales force to target strategic areas of opportunity to include global accounts, health care, higher education and others. We have also placed sales representatives and technical specialists into certain dealerships to support programs such as Knoll Essentials, which is described below. We expanded our sales force by investing in a 15% increase to cover a more dispersed market which has shifted to include increased small to mid-size projects and fewer large projects.
In addition to coordinating sales efforts with the sales representatives, our dealers generally handle project management, installation and maintenance for client accounts after the initial product selection and sale. Although many of these dealerships also carry products of other manufacturers, they have agreed not to act as dealers for our principal direct competitors. We have not experienced significant dealer turnover. Our dealers' substantial commitment to understanding our product lines, and their strong relationships with us, serve to discourage dealers from changing vendor affiliations. We are not significantly dependent on any one dealer, the largest of which accounted for approximately 4.6%, 3.5%, and 4.3%, of our North American sales in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 
As part of our commitment to building relationships with our dealers, we maintain the Knoll Essentials program. Knoll Essentials is a catalog program developed in response to dealer requests for a consolidated, user-friendly selling tool for day-to-day systems, seating, storage, and accessory products. The Knoll Essentials program includes dealer incentives to sell our products. We also employ a dedicated team of dealer sales representatives to work with our dealerships. 
Sales to U.S. and state and local government agencies, respectively, aggregated approximately 4.1% and 6.0%, respectively, of our consolidated sales in 2017. The U.S. government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract.

Manufacturing and Operations 
Our global supply chain manufactures and assembles products to specific customer orders and operates all facilities under a philosophy of continuous improvement and lean manufacturing. Our Office Segment is supported by sites in Canada, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The Studio Segment is supported by sites in Illinois, Italy, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas. Sites in Connecticut, New York and Pennsylvania support our Coverings Segment. In addition, we utilize many third parties to produce a variety of our Office and Studio designs.
We continue to look for ways to ensure that our manufacturing capabilities match our supply chain strategy providing the most value for Knoll. The root of our continuous improvement efforts lies in the philosophy of lean manufacturing that drives operations. As part of this philosophy, we partner with suppliers who can facilitate efficient and often just-in-time deliveries, allowing us to manage our raw materials inventory. We also utilize “Kaizen” work groups in the plants to develop best practices to minimize scrap, time and material waste at all stages of the manufacturing process. The involvement of employees at all levels ensures an organizational commitment to lean and efficient manufacturing operations. These projects improved customer responsiveness, quality and significantly improve productivity.
Raw Materials and Suppliers 
In addition to the continued focus on enhancing the efficiency of the manufacturing operations, we also seek to reduce costs through our global sourcing effort. We have capitalized on raw material and component cost savings available through lower cost global suppliers. This broader view of potential sources of supply has enhanced our leverage with domestic supply sources, and we have been able to reduce cycle times by extracting improvements from all levels throughout the supply chain. 
The purchasing function in North America is centralized at the East Greenville facility for Office, KnollStudio, and Textiles. This centralization, and the close relationships with our primary suppliers, has enhanced our ability to realize purchasing economies of scale and implement “just-in-time” inventory practices. Steel, lumber, paper, paint, plastics, laminates, particleboard, veneers, glass, fabrics, leathers, upholstery filling material, aluminum extrusions and castings are used in our manufacturing process. Both domestic and overseas suppliers of these materials are selected based upon a variety of factors, with the price and quality of the materials and the supplier's ability to meet delivery requirements being primary factors in such selection. We do not generally enter into long-term supply contracts and, as a result, we can be vulnerable to fluctuations in the prices for these materials. No supplier is the only available source for a particular component or raw material. However, because of the specialization involved with some of our components, it can take a significant amount of time, money and effort to move to an alternate source. 
Competition 
The markets in which we compete are highly competitive. We compete on the basis of (i) product design, including performance, ergonomic and aesthetic features; (ii) product quality and durability; (iii) relationships with clients, architects and designers; (iv) strength of dealer and distributor network; (v) on-time delivery and service performance; (vi) commitment to environmental standards by offering products that help clients achieve LEED® certified facilities and minimize environmental impact; and (vii) price. We estimate our share of the North American office furniture market in 2017 and 2016 was 7.4% and 7.0%, respectively. 
Some of our competitors, especially those in North America, are larger and have significantly greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and technical resources than us. Our most significant competitors in primary markets are Herman Miller, Inc., Steelcase, Inc., Haworth, Inc. and, to a lesser extent, Allsteel, Inc., an operating unit of HNI Corporation, and Teknion Corporation. These competitors have a substantial volume of furniture installed at businesses throughout North America, providing a continual source of demand for further products and enhancements. Moreover, the products of these competitors have strong acceptance in the marketplace. Despite our competitors strength in the marketplace, we believe that we have been able to compete successfully in the markets to date.
Competition in the Studio and Coverings segments are much more fragmented than in the Office segment. Our Studio and Coverings businesses serve the mid-to high-end of the market, but compete against many companies, none of which has a dominant market share.

Patents and Trademarks 
We consider securing and protecting our intellectual property rights to be important to the business. We own approximately 49 active U.S. utility patents on various components used in our products and systems and approximately 101 active U.S. design patents. We also own approximately 371 patents in various foreign countries. The scope and duration of our patent protection varies throughout the world by jurisdiction and by individual product. In particular, patents for individual products extend for varying periods of time according to the date a patent application is filed, the date a patent is granted and the term of patent protection available in the jurisdiction granting the patent (generally 20 years from the date of filing in the U.S., for example). We believe that the duration of the applicable patents we are granted is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. We own approximately 78 trademark registrations in the U.S., including registrations to the following trademarks, as well as related stylized depictions of the Knoll word mark: Knoll®, KnollExtra®, Knoll Luxe®, KnollStudio®, KnollTextiles®, Good Design Is Good Business®, Antenna®, Autostrada®, Calibre®, Currents®, Dividends®, Edelman® Leather, Modern Always®, Propeller®, Reff®, Sapper XYZ®, Spinneybeck® Leather, Toboggan®, Generation by Knoll®, Regeneration by Knoll®, MultiGeneration by Knoll®, Remix®, HOLLY HUNT®, GREAT OUTDOORS A HOLLY HUNT COLLECTION® and VLADIMIR KAGAN®. 
We also own approximately 296 trademarks registered in foreign countries. The scope and duration of our trademark protection varies throughout the world, with some countries protecting trademarks only as long as the mark is used, and others requiring registration of the mark and the payment of registration (generally ten years from the date of filing in the U.S., for example). In order to protect the indefinite duration, we make filings to continue registration of our trademarks. 
In October 2004, we received registered trademark protection in the United States for five iconic furniture designs by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe-the Barcelona Chair, the Barcelona Stool, the Barcelona Couch, the Barcelona Table and the Flat Bar Brno Chair. This protection recognizes the renown of these designs and reflects our commitment to ensuring that when architects, furniture retailers, businesses and individuals purchase a Ludwig Mies van der Rohe design, they are acquiring the authentic product, manufactured in accordance with the designer's historic specifications. Barcelona® is a registered trademark in the U.S., Canada and European Community owned by Knoll, Inc.
Foreign and Domestic Operations

Environmental Matters 
We believe that we are substantially in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations for the protection of the environment and the health and safety of our employees based upon existing facts presently known to us. Compliance with federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other related activities has had and will continue to have an impact on our operations, but has, since 1990, been accomplished without having a material adverse effect on our operations. There can be no assurance that such laws and regulations will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs as a result of such laws and regulations. We have trained staff responsible for monitoring compliance with environmental, health and safety requirements. Our goal is to reduce and, wherever possible, eliminate the creation of hazardous waste in our manufacturing processes. While it is difficult to estimate the timing and ultimate costs to be incurred due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations and technology, based on information currently known to management, we do not expect environmental costs or contingencies to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, competitive position, or cash flows. The operation of manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas, however, and we cannot be certain that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future which could adversely affect our operations. 
We have been identified as a potentially responsible party pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, or “CERCLA,” for remediation costs associated with waste disposal sites previously used by us. CERCLA can impose liability for costs to investigate and remediate contamination without regard to fault or the legality of disposal and, under certain circumstances, liability may be joint and several resulting in one responsible party being held responsible for the entire obligation. Liability may also include damages for harm to natural resources. The remediation costs and our allocated share at some of these CERCLA sites are unknown. We may also be subject to claims for personal injury or contribution relating to CERCLA sites. We reserve amounts for such matters when expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable. 
Knoll is committed to using materials and technology efficiently to conserve natural resources, developing energy-efficient processes; diverting waste generated by our operations and products; and protecting the health and safety of our associates and communities. Products that contribute to sustainable development include our GREENGUARD Children & Schools(SM) certified Generation and Remix families of chairs; and our BIFMA Level 3 certified Dividends Horizon and Antenna Workspace products. Each year we issue an Environmental Health & Safety Annual Report which tracks our pursuit of sustainability across all Knoll businesses.

As of December 31, 2017, we employed a total of 3,402 people, consisting of 1,903 hourly and 1,499 salaried employees. The Grand Rapids, Michigan plant is the only unionized plant within North America and has an agreement with the Carpenters Union, Local 1615, of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, Affiliate of the Carpenters Industrial Council (the “Union”), covering approximately 203 hourly employees or 6.0% of the Company's labor force. The Collective Bargaining Agreement was entered into on May 1, 2015 and expires April 2018. From time to time, there have been unsuccessful efforts to unionize at our other North American locations. We believe that relations with our employees are good. Nonetheless, it is possible that our employees may continue attempts to unionize. Certain workers in the facilities in Italy are also represented by unions.
