ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
OVERVIEW
 
Findex.com, Inc. is headquartered in Lake Park, Florida with its base of business operations co-located in the same facility. The Company is currently comprised of EcoSmart and a consolidated variable interest entity, Advanced Nanofibers, LLC. EcoSmart has historically been the driver of both operating overhead and revenue. EcoSmart, was acquired by us in a merger in 2014 and centers around a proprietary line of specialty materials coatings that have a broad range of value-adding industrial, commercial, residential and consumer applications. Advanced Nanofibers, LLC is a variable interest entity. During the fourth quarter of 2016 management determined the Company was the primary beneficiary of Advanced, and consolidated those operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company currently owns a minority 23.88% interest in Advanced, which is a Florida-based, nano-technology firm founded in mid-2016 by the Company and two other technology firms. This collaborative joint venture is focused on globally broadening the industrial utilization of nanoparticle-enhanced nanofibers across a diverse range of mass-market industrial and consumer applications. Despite our lack of corporate control over Advanced Nanofibers, and its lack of revenue to date, it is a venture that our management has been and continues to be very actively involved in developing, and that is increasingly consuming a greater percentage of our financial and human resources, a trend management expects to continue into the foreseeable future.

ECOSMART
 
Our core business is centered around a line of specialty industrial glass-based “smart surface” coatings that have a wide range of uses across each of the industrial, commercial, and household market segments and that are centered around a U.S. patented technology that, either on its own or when coupled with any of an array of available proprietary formula additives, offers a unique combination of beneficial surface properties that allow for a broad array of multi-surface and end-product applications. Among others, such applications include:

▪ | Heavy Construction Equipment/Vehicles 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | Oil and Gas Drilling and Related Heavy Equipment 
▪ | Industrial and Residential HVAC Equipment, Commercial Refrigeration Systems, and Power Generators
▪ | Interior and Exterior Flooring and Tiling, Pavers and Hardscapes 

 
Over time, EcoSmart intends to develop itself in the strategic direction of becoming a leading research-oriented high-tech specialty “smart-surface” materials development and licensing company centered around a highly-qualified research team and state-of-the-art research lab and applying a combination of organic and inorganic chemistries, materials science engineering, and nanotechnology. EcoSmart currently has expertise and capabilities in each of these areas.
 
Products
 
Broadly viewed, the surface is an integral aspect of virtually every physical object and often plays a fundamental role in many of the processes, beyond mere connectivity and structural support, that govern chemical and biological interactions involving the product. In some instances, the surface serves to protect the internal elements of the object that it surrounds; in others, it provides an entry point into those chemical or biological systems. In most, combinations of these attributes are present, and the potential variations are both vast in number and complex in structure.
 
Our specialty coatings business produces, markets, and distributes a line of effectively invisible glass-based specialty coatings – “smart surfaces” – that have a wide range of industrial, commercial, and household applications that add a competitive advantage to a given product or surface through a variety of protective and other features. Conventional coatings, which are bonded by mechanical means to whatever surface they are applied to, tend to fail, ultimately, in the bonding to the substrate, typically due to poor surface preparation or variation of temperature exposures. Uniquely, EcoSmart’s products consist of inorganic and organic combinatorial chemistry that causes them to bond chemically with the substrate, whether metal, cement-based, or organic (e.g. plastics). By utilizing covalent bonding that penetrates into the substrate and reacts directly with the free ion within, the otherwise resulting disbondment is avoided. The result is a much longer lasting and stronger coating, and, in turn, a longer life for the substrate that has been treated.
 
With an addition of only 50 millionths to 2 thousandths of an inch in surface thickness (depending on which product is used), no loss of either hardness, on the one hand, or pliability, on the other, and no reduction in photon (light) penetration, the patented platform technology, either on its own or when coupled with any of an array of available proprietary formula additives, offers the following unique combination of beneficial protective, maintenance-reducing, performance-enhancing and cosmetically-enhancing properties to most surfaces, including metals, plastics, paints, fabrics, vinyl, wood, masonry, or concrete, in each case without regard to temperature, climate or most other environmental conditions, without hazard to either human, animal or plant health/life, and for a period of up to as many as approximately 15-20 years:

Heavy Construction Equipment/Vehicles. This is the market segment application involving foundational heavy terrain construction equipment fleets and individual units. It comprises a wide range of vehicles including gators, bulldozers, excavators, dump trucks, cement mixers, and other, similar types of equipment. This is the market segment application surrounding a vast array of opportunities to sell certain of our coatings to prevent rust, oxidation, corrosion and abrasion breakdown in the heavy construction industry. We believe that our coatings could result in notably significant savings in maintenance costs as well as extended life for these types of equipment/vehicles used in these highly corrosive environments.

Oil and Gas Drilling, Mining and Related Heavy Equipment. This is the market segment application surrounding a vast array of opportunities to sell certain of our coatings to prevent rust, oxidation, corrosion and abrasion breakdown in the oil, gas and mining industries. We believe that our coatings could result in notably significant savings in maintenance costs as well as extended life for equipment, tools, and infrastructure used in these highly corrosive environments. In this market segment, our coatings could be used as protective pipe linings and as protective coating on storage tanks, micro-turbines, hydraulic systems, fleet vehicles, rail cars and shipping containers. According to recent industry reports, and with industrial coatings generally comprising more than approximately a third of the worldwide aggregate coatings market, the oil and gas segment is one viewed by us as holding the greatest growth potential. Based on the preliminary results of early-stage field and lab tests being conducted by prospective customers, and though there can be no assurance, management believes the effectiveness of its products for this purpose is already higher than many competing products, and that the market and demand for these products is potentially very significant. We are aggressively targeting this application based on a combination of all of the factors identified above, and, to date, we have been pursuing potential distribution opportunities through select industry operators. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Industrial and Residential HVAC Equipment, Commercial Refrigeration Systems, and Power Generators. This is the market segment application consisting of coatings for HVAC and commercial refrigeration systems intended to serve as protection from corrosion, including in salt water, acid, alkaline and chemical environments, and from clogging by particles of mold, pollen, dust, and soot. Substantial testing in this area by a variety of industry participants has shown that there is a significant efficiency loss factor on HVAC units due to natural oxidation and the restricted airflow resulting from dirt build-up on the condenser coils. With a product that repels moisture and contaminants, offers increased operating/energy efficiency of 12-15% over the life of a subject condensing unit, and substantially reduced cleaning requirements generally, management believes a significant opportunity exists for the Company within this market. Accordingly, we have targeted this application based on a combination of all of the factors identified above and are currently in the process of pursuing a strategic marketing plan aimed at this segment.

Interior and Exterior Flooring and Tiling, Pavers and Hardscapes. This is the market segment defined by us to include applications involving surfaces consisting of pavers, poured and stamped concrete, natural stone, brick, and ceramic tile. It has been targeted based on a combination of all of the factors identified above, with a particular emphasis on (i) geographic accessibility to the regional market of South Florida, in which the Company maintains its executive offices and principal operations, and (ii) relative ease of installation. At a competitive price point, the Company’s products offer this market a high-grade, functional alternative to comparatively under-performing water-based hardscape sealants, and one with numerous unique, secondary benefits. The marketing and sales strategy being applied by us is a dual-pronged approach aimed at manufacturers of primary materials, on the one hand, and contractor installers, on the other. Our latest entrant into this market is a competitively priced, single-part application paver coating that features greater ease-of-use than many comparable and competing products.

In general, though not necessarily across all segments, we intend to pursue a strategic approach to identify market opportunities that rely on master distribution arrangements within individual product/application industry verticals. An emphasis is being made in the immediate-term on the establishment of such master distribution relationships with prospective sellers that already have in place an industrial customer-base with the greatest likelihood of benefitting from our product(s) and, ideally, without there being an appreciable lag-time in customer adoption of our product because of it effectively serving as an available upgrade to their existing offerings.
 
For purposes of development, competitive analysis, and prioritizing sales initiatives and resource deployment, we view our specialty coatings business in terms of numerous individual markets identified in each case by reference to the particular combination of our product, on the one hand, and targeted surface and application, on the other. While our complete line of individual specialty coatings products includes more than fifteen separate formulations, the following list identifies some of our largest selling products, by name, together with their respective primary targeted surfaces and application categories, as well certain information in each case relating to their unique benefits in relation to the target application.

Certain of the Science Behind Our Technology
 
The most unique feature shared by our coatings, and the specific focal point of a patent held by us and considered by management to be the centerpiece of our smart surface technology, is the positive surface charge they possess once applied. It is this positive surface charge that is responsible for their most unique and valuable properties identified above, including the hydrophobicity, oleophobicity, microbial and fungal resistance, dust-repellance, and the enhanced aerodynamics and hydrodynamics.
 
Hydrophobicity is a term largely unfamiliar to many outside scientific circles, but that describes a quality with which most everybody has a basic familiarity. Surfaces may be characterized as either hydrophilic or hydrophobic depending on whether or not they attract or repel water or other water-based liquids. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces are abundant in both nature as well as in synthetic materials, and they exist both organically and inorganically in terms of chemical composition. A hydrophilic surface 
can be wet and may adsorb water; a hydrophobic surface cannot and will not – it is compositionally incapable of becoming wet. An example of a hydrophilic surface encountered routinely in daily life are sponges, which, of course, readily soak up whatever water with which they come into contact, at least to the point of saturation. Hydrophobic materials and coatings, by contrast, prevent water from pooling on their surfaces. In scientific terms, hybrophobicity is caused by surfaces that disrupt the hydrogen bonding in water; so as to minimize the disruption in its molecular makeup, the water droplet pushes itself away from the surface to minimize its contact area, thus becoming very tightly bound. Hydrophobic materials are generally easy to identify because water forms into droplets upon contact with them after which they tend to roll around freely, like marbles on a flat Formica countertop, as occurs commonly on the freshly waxed exterior of a car or recently cleaned windshield with new wiper blades. The more hydrophobic the material (all the way up to and including so-called “superhydrophobic” surfaces), the stronger this effect, until the water effectively floats or skims across the surface with what amounts to very low friction. Naturally occurring hydrophobic surfaces include many species of plant leaves and flower petals, as well as many types of bird feathers and the outer body parts of a variety of insects; the lotus leaf is among the most hydrophobic of naturally occurring hydrophobic surfaces. Synthetic hydrophobic surfaces include such household-name brands as Scotchgard™ ™ treated fabric, Teflon®® coated metal, or Rain-X®® coated glass.
 
Oleophobicity is a property very comparable to hydrophobicity, but it relates to oil-repellancy, not water-repellancy. There are important technical differences, but, for practical and basic observational purposes, they are very similar.
 
In terms of chemistry, our platform smart surface, and the coating variations identified above for which it serves as a basis, are inorganic, formed as they are of chemically “grown” glass. The process by which they form upon application can be likened to the process, witnessed by many daily in science classrooms, labs, or at home with popular science kits, whereby quartz crystals are effectively “grown” in a solution. This is important because it results in the establishment of a uniquely firm chemical bond between the coating and the surface, far stronger than would exist through either a mechanical or light bonding (the traditional alternatives), fundamentally setting the coatings apart from most others. When coupled with the unusually thin layer they inhabit – approximately 50 millionths to 1-2 thousandths of an inch – the combination of properties leaves them notably flexible, permitting their use in connection with such items as fabrics, plastics, and pliable floor-boards, yet hard, durable, and resilient, particularly when refined with select additives.

 The additives used in our various coating formulations available to customers fall into three basic categories. In the first category are color tints, which, in recent years, have seen major technology advancements in terms of durability, variety and depth of color, reflectivity, and fade-resistance. We have available to us a wide range of the most advanced offerings in this regard. In the second category are additives intended to provide increased hardness and wear-resistance. Here, too, we have access to what we believe are some of the most superior materials available. In the third category are EPA-approved, “on-contact” mechanical microbial germ and virus (so-called) “quat” (industrial and commercial quaternary ammonium) killers. These additives work in such a way as to prohibit the mutation of microbials which can otherwise become resistant over time to chemical kill mechanisms such as antibiotics and are capable of fortifying any of our coatings with additional protection against bacteria and relatively large viruses/microbials, including, for example, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (more commonly known as “MRSA), Clostridium difficile bacterial infection (more commonly known as “C-diff”), and Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (more commonly known as “H1N1” or “Swine Flu”). By combining our coatings – which, based on their positive surface charge, already powerfully discourage the growth of many of the smaller, more common viruses which can exist between active elements of existing “on-contact” killers (such as the Norovirus, for example, a concern long plaguing the vacation cruise ship industry) – with a quat and certain other additives available to us, a unique, broader spectrum of microbial protection is afforded, un-matched, in the belief of the Company’s management, by any other product in anti-microbial effectiveness.
 
Long-Term Strategic Direction
 
Although there can be no assurance, over time, we intend to progress in the strategic direction of becoming a leading research-oriented high-tech specialty “smart-surface” materials development and licensing company centered around a highly qualified research team and state-of-the-art research lab and applying a combination of organic and inorganic chemistries, materials science engineering, and nanotechnology. We currently have developing expertise and capabilities in each of these areas.
 
Organic chemistry is a chemistry sub-discipline involving the scientific study of the structure, properties, and reactions of organic compounds and organic materials (i.e., matter in its various forms that contain carbon atoms). Inorganic chemistry, by contrast, refers to the chemistry sub-discipline aimed at understanding the synthesis and behavior of inorganic and organometallic compounds, generally focused on the silicon atom. Nanotechnology is the creation of functional materials, devices and systems through control of matter (atoms and molecules) on the nanometer length scale (1-500 nanometers), and exploitation of novel phenomena and properties (physical, chemical, biological, mechanical, electrical) at that length scale. Materials science engineering has as its focus, among others, the development of new products based on materials whose properties and behavior are controlled at the micrometer and nanometer scales, and through microfabrication technologies.
 
Manufacturing and Fulfillment
 
We currently conduct all manufacturing and fulfillment operations on our own at our facility in Lake Park, FL. Though output capacity is currently limited, we intend to expand in-house capacity in the near future, subject to our having available to us the requisite capital investment. The manufacturing process is comprised largely of combining and blending raw materials and chemicals, including additives, in each case consistent with our proprietary formulations, and bottling of final product into labeled, quart, gallon and larger containers. In general, on-hand inventory is kept to a minimum and built up based on forecasted near-term sales.

- 9 -
-----

Backlog 
 
In general, we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders and do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Accordingly, we do not believe that backlog information is material to an understanding of our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or other metric of financial performance.
Product Returns Policies and Warranties
 
Our product returns policies and warranties differ materially based on the type of surface to which our products are being applied as well as the anticipated performance life of the particular product.
 
In general, we maintain a consistent return policy relative to any products in relation to which there is either no associated installation or, if there is an installation involved, it is one in which we have no participation or for which we have any responsibility (as may be the case in relation to our paver application specialty coating products). The policy under such circumstances requires that the subject products be returned unopened within no more than 30 days of purchase, and that all shipping charges associated with the return be borne by the customer. For a period of up to five years from purchase, a warranty is extended in such cases to customers relative to both the chemical integrity (as represented upon sale) and the performance integrity of the coatings based on the specific characteristics of the subject product and application, and the corresponding representations made by the Company in relation thereto.
 
Our returns policies and product warranties are general policies and warranties and are subject to change in relation to any particular sale. Further, the general policies and warranties themselves are subject to change from time to time and are likely to evolve as our operations and revenues develop.
 
Significant Customers and Vendors
 
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we generated a significant portion of our revenues from certain customers as follows:
 

 | % of Total Revenues
------------------------+--------------------
Customer | 2016 | | 2015
Dekko Concrete | | 15.46 | % | 4.23 | %
Infiniti Coatings, LLC. | | 14.80 | % | 5.32 | %
Ready Mix USA, LLC. | | 13.38 | % | — | 

 
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our significant product and chemical raw material purchases were as follows:
 

 | % to Total Products
---------+--------------------
 | 2016 | | 2015 | 
Vendor A | 54.73 | % | 46.40 | %
Vendor B | 10.05 | % | — | 
Vendor C | — | | 16.94 | %

 
We currently have no long-term written agreements with any of these vendors. The payment terms are generally net 30 days, and we are not substantially dependent upon any one or more of them; all are easily replaceable with any locally or nationally available supplier.

Research and Development
 
Though a substantial and growing percentage of our operating expense, our research and development (“R&D”) has been very modest in recent years, in real dollar terms, due to a lack of allocable funds. The limited R&D activities that have been pursued over this period have been conducted exclusively in-house.
 
Our R&D objective is to leverage our unique, integrated, emerging science capabilities to drive revenue and margin growth. Our R&D initiatives are principally focused on our strategic priority of achieving a leadership position across the relatively higher margin, science-driven segments of the specialized coatings and surfaces markets in which it operates by developing and refining differentiated, advanced industrial and related coatings and surface materials. We believe that our specialized scientific expertise, together with our developing R&D program, combine to provide us with distinctive, competitive advantages that position us to establish broad global reach over time and deep market penetration in our market verticals.
 
Our EcoSmart R&D team consists of two full-time personnel and two part-time personnel.
 
We continue to protect our R&D investments and assets through pursuit of a comprehensive intellectual property strategy. See discussion under “Intellectual Property.”
 
Regulation
 
We are subject to an extensive array of stringent regulations arising under a broad range of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws relating to the generation, storage, handling, discharge, disposition and stewardship of hazardous wastes and other harmful materials. These regulations have potential implications for us in terms of our manufacturing operations, product handling and use by customers and agents, as well as installation processes. In this regard, we will likely have to expend substantial amounts to comply with such laws and regulations as well as establish and maintain an evolving set of policies to minimize and control our environmental discharge and emissions. Nevertheless, legislative, regulatory and economic uncertainties (including existing and potential laws and regulations pertaining to climate change) may make it difficult for us to project future spending for these purposes and, if there is an acceleration in new regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend substantial additional funds to remain in compliance.
Competition
 
Product performance, technology, cost effectiveness, quality and technical and customer service are major competitive factors in the industrial coatings businesses. We are unaware of any one or more products possessing the same combination of physical properties, and that, on the whole, offers the same array of benefits, as its proprietary line of specialty smart surface coatings. There can be no assurance, however, that there not products under development or already in existence and in the early stages of market introduction of which management is not yet aware. The market for industrial and product performance coatings is extremely large, broad in scope, and consists of many different segments and sub-segments, each of which involves a range of product applications. It is also increasingly characterized by rapidly evolving technology. Precisely because of the wide array of beneficial properties they possess, and notwithstanding the U.S. patent held by us on our platform smart surface technology, the specialty coatings produced and distributed by us should be viewed as competing with other coatings products across a wide variety of the various existing market segments and sub-segments. Hydrophobic, anti-corrosion and antimicrobial coatings, for example, are each segments in which numerous companies are aggressively competing with one another worldwide, both in terms of technology and market share, but that, combined, represent only a minor portion of the aggregate competition that we should be viewed as meaningfully confronting.

- 11 -
------

 
 The competition faced by us in relation to our proprietary line of specialty smart surface coatings includes both public and private organizations and collaborations among academic institutions and large companies, both domestic and foreign, most of which have significantly greater experience and financial resources than us. We expect that our most significant competitors will tend to be larger, more established companies, including many major multinational corporations such as Akzo Nobel N.V., PPG Industries, Inc., Axalta Coating Systems, and Valspar Corporation. In general, these companies are all developing products that, at some level or in one or more ways, compete with ours and, in addition to many existing issued and pending patents, they have significantly greater capital and other resources available to them for research and development, testing, seeking and obtaining any required regulatory approvals, marketing and distribution. In addition, many smaller coatings and related nanotechnology companies have formed strategic alliances or collaborative arrangements, partnerships, and other types of joint ventures with larger, well-established industry competitors that afford these companies’ potential research and development and commercialization advantages, and may be aided in becoming significant competitors through rapid evolution of new technologies. Academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private dedicated research organizations are also financing and conducting research and development activities that could result in the introduction of products directly competitive to our own.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Patents and Licenses
 
The competitive environment in which we operate is largely driven by technology, proprietary or otherwise. In general, companies in this environment seek to develop competitive advantages – both offensive and defensive – through the obtaining and maintaining of relevant patents relating to their respective technological advancements. As a science and technology based company, we believe that securing intellectual property is an important part of protecting our research, and that, in particular, patent, as well as related trade secret – protection, is critical for the new specialty coatings technologies we develop, as well as any products and processes derived through them.
 
By way of assignment, we currently hold a United States patent relating to our smart surface specialty coatings technology:
 

Title | Awarded | Pending | Expiration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+---------+-----------
Method of Treating Surfaces For Self-Sterilization and Microbial Growth Resistance | X | | 2025 

 
Over time, we intend to apply for additional patents relating to advancements we achieve through our research and development initiatives. There can be no assurance however, that any of the patents currently held, or any obtained in the future, will prove adequate to protect our technologies or that we will have sufficient financial and other resources to keep others from infringing the exclusive rights we possess in relation to our technologies. The fields in which we operate have been characterized by significant efforts by competitors to establish dominant or blocking patent rights to gain a competitive advantage, and by considerable differences of opinion as to the value and legal legitimacy of competitors’ purported patent rights and the technologies they actually utilize in their businesses.
 
Because we may license our technology and products in foreign markets, we may also seek foreign patent protection for some specific patents. With respect to foreign patents, the patent laws of other countries may differ significantly from those of the United States as to the patentability of our products or technology.
 
It is possible that competitors in both the United States and foreign countries, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may have applied for, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents, which will have an adverse impact on our ability to make and sell our products. There can also be no assurance that competitors will not infringe on our patents or will not claim that we are infringing on their patents. Defense and prosecution of patent infringement suits, even if successful, are both costly and time consuming. An adverse outcome in the defense of a patent infringement suit could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or potentially even require us to cease our operations.

Trade Secrets
 
Certain aspects of our know-how and technology are not patentable, or, for strategic reasons, are best protected in the determination of management by leaving them unpatented. In this regard, trade secrets play an important part in our intellectual property strategy, and we vigilantly seek to protect them. To protect our proprietary position in trade secrets, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators with access to our technology to enter into confidentiality and invention ownership agreements with us. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure. Further, in the absence of patent protection, competitors who independently develop substantially equivalent technology, or otherwise acquire it, may adversely impact our business. If and when we discover that any trade secrets have been misappropriated, it is expected that we will, unless we otherwise determine for strategic or similar reasons, report the matter to governmental authorities for investigation and potential criminal action, as appropriate. In addition, and to the extent that we have the available financial resources, we intend to take all reasonably required measures in an effort to mitigate any potential adverse economic impact, which may include civil actions seeking redress, restitution and/or damages based on losses sustained by us and/or unjust enrichment by a counter-party.
 
We are currently in the process of evaluating our options in connection with the registering of trademarks for our specialty coatings business, and this process is expected to be ongoing. Unlike patent rights, ownership rights in trademarks do not expire if the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected.
 
ADVANCED NANOFIBERS (VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY)
 
Advanced Nanofibers LLC (“Advanced”) is a variable interest entity of which the Company owned a minority 24.875% interest at December 31, 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2016 management determined that the Company was the primary beneficiary based on qualitative and quantitative factors, and consolidated the entity in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Advanced is a Florida-based, nano-technology firm founded in September 2016 by the Company and two other technology firms as a collaborative joint venture focused on globally broadening the utilization of nanoparticle-enhanced nanofibers across a diverse range of mass-market industrial and consumer applications. Management believes the prospects for Advanced Nanofibers are extraordinary based on the following key factors that afford it a distinct competitive advantage:

▪ | An industrial end-product that is significantly meaningfully to competitive products by virtue of a proprietary high-tech process; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | The ability to deliver that product at a fraction of the cost for which competitive product - meaningfully inferior in quality - is available; and 
▪ | The ability to produce and deliver that product – and to facilitate its use by those handling it - in a way that meaningfully lessens the health and safety risks ordinarily associated with the handling of both nanofibers and nanoparticles.

 
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Advanced Nanofibers is owned and controlled approximately 96% by its three founding entities, each of which are actively involved in its development. In addition to the Company, this includes Nanotech Fibers LLC, a recently organized, Florida-based, closely-held, private firm engaged in various strategic pursuits within and surrounding the nanotech and related materials industrial sector, and EnVont, LLC, a Florida-based, venture-stage developer and marketer of proprietary nanotechnology-based materials and coatings focused on protective thin films, smart coatings and multi-functional particles. Although it is still in a pre-revenue stage of development, our management team devotes a very significant percentage of time to the business of Advanced Nanofibers.
 
Technology
 
EcoSmart management views Advanced Nanofiber’s platform technological contributions as centering around:
 

▪ | disruptive technological advances in the custom molecular bonding of nanofibers to application-specific nanoparticles 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | cost-efficient production capabilities at scale, and 
▪ | materials characteristics that render them relatively safe by industry standards in terms of their production, handling and use.

 Nanofibers are generally recognized as any industrial fibers with diameters of less than 500 nanometers. They can be produced by melt processing, interfacial polymerization, electro-spinning, antisolvent-induced polymer precipitation and/or electrostatic spinning. In their raw form, they can be either polymer-based nanofibers, carbon-based nanofibers, or carbon nanotube composite nanofibers, each of which have different properties and qualities, and corresponding advantages and disadvantages. Advanced Nanofibers is strictly focused for the time being on product development involving polymer-based nanofibers.
 
Historically, the primary obstacles in significantly broadening the use of nanofibers (all types) throughout global industry have been the following:
 

▪ | inadequacy of materials performance, resulting from a technological inability to successfully bond nanoparticles to the surface area of host nanofibers at sufficiently high ratios to achieve the performance objectives, principally attributable to the lack of an effective process for nanoparticle dispersion;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | high cost, due to the combination of ultra-high energy requirements for production, on the one hand, and transport challenges stemming from the finished product being extremely lightweight but voluminous, on the other; and 
▪ | environmental health and safety challenges stemming from the potentially hazardous particulates emitted into the air during the production, transport and handling of these materials. 

 
Because of their relative strength-to-weight ratio, raw nanofibers can be very useful for many industrial purposes and products. The wide-scale benefits potentially derivable by their use, however, have not historically been significant enough to justify the associated expense, leaving adoption rates low. It has only been through the use of nanoparticle additive enhancements (e.g. silicone dioxide [SiO2], titanium dioxide [TiO2], among many others) that the value of the underlying benefits of using nanofibers has been viewed by observers across a wide industrial spectrum to rise to a level significant enough to fundamentally change the economics involved and support a compelling commercial value proposition. But principally due to the lack of an effective production process at the quantum level for dispersion of the nanoparticles throughout and among the fibers, even the use of nanoparticle additive enhancements in connection with nanofibers has never gained the level of industrial traction many have long been projecting. Such a process, if it existed, would ideally enable the successful bonding of a homogenuous mix of the nanoparticles to the surface area of host fibers at an average ratio sufficiently high to achieve most recognized industrial-level performance objective thresholds.
 
Advanced Nanofibers has developed a process that it believes provides a solution to each of the obstacles hindering the wide-scale incorporation of nanofibers in industrial and consumer products. What Advanced Nanofibers is doing is expected by both ourselves and the members of the Advanced Nanofibers senior management team to provide a technological catalyst for participants across the industrial spectrum to finally capitalize on the potential for nanofiber-based applications and the pent-up industrial demand for the substantially higher-quality goods that they make possible.

The unique and compelling aspect of Advanced Nanotech’s proprietary technology is the capacity it enables to molecularly bond performance/application-specific nanoparticle reinforcements to raw nanofibers with an end-result that – owing to extremely high surface-to-weight ratio when compared to traditional fiber-based technologies – exhibits new and improved physical, flexural, chemical and structural properties. Meeting the long-standing, historic challenges in this area head on, the technology centers around a process that enables the much broader dispersibility of those nanoparticles throughout the nanofiber environment within which the bonding process itself occurs. This is accomplished through a hybridized nanofiber surface treatment process with dispersion properties believed by Advanced Nanofiber’s management to be superior to any previously utilized and which results in a homogeneous mix of the nanoparticles on the fibers themselves that is comparatively, and significantly, higher than any other that either we or the Advanced Nanofibers management team are aware.
 
Products


The nanoparticle-enhanced product that Advanced Nanofibers will be producing is expected by the firm’s management to bring a new dimension to polymeric-based advanced composites. Because of its base composition, it can be produced in a virtually limitless array of industrial application-specific varieties, to be used either alone or in conjunction with other fibers and materials, making it an ideal host for a variety of advanced and custom composites.
 
Although Advanced Nanofibers is expecting to produce only polymer-based nanoparticle-enhanced nanofibers in the near-term (inclusive, however, of a wide variety of polymers), to the best of our knowledge, application of the technology possessed by Advanced Nanofibers theoretically extends to both carbon and nanotube composite nanofibers as well.
 
Applications and Markets
 
We anticipate that our nanoparticle-bonded nanofibers have a very broad range of applications and will come to be utilized across and throughout many large global markets, including cement, building materials, textiles, thermoplastics, steel, medical, energy and a wide range of insulation and filtration applications.
 
Initially and currently, Advanced Nanofibers is focused on the global cement industry, a space within which we offer a commercially scalable and economically viable technology platform that intelligently marries innovation and sustainability. In this opportunity-rich domain, we are uniquely able to deliver value-added solutions by reducing emissions, cement content, and minimizing carbon footprint. Nanoparticles, such as silicone dioxide [SiO2] and titanium dioxide [TiO2], have been found to be a very effective additive for achieving high-performance and self-compacting concrete with improved workability and strength. The non-silica addition makes the concrete mixes more cohesive, reducing bleeding and segregation. It also increases density, reduces porosity and improves the bond between cement matrix and aggregates. This produces concrete that shows higher compressive and flexural strength. The addition of nanoparticles results in denser and improved microstructure making concrete more durable and resistant to environmental degradation.

 In recent tests conducted by a highly regarded ASTM testing firm serving the U.S. cement industry, Advanced Nanofibers received certain very positive performance data relating to its nanofiber/particle-enhanced concrete.
 
As the following statistical data highlight, the global cement opportunity reflects one of the largest product markets of any kind:
 

▪ | Approximately a USD$394 billion market worldwide in 2016, up from approximately USD$237 billion in 2011, representing an increase of roughly 40% over the past 5 years. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | According to the Portland Cement Association (PCA), a widely recognized industry group, global cement consumption is expected to have grown 3.7 percent in 2016, and progress at a roughly 4 percent rate during each of 2017 and 2018. At approximately 4.3 billion metric tons in 2014, such consumption shall have exceeded the 5 billion metric ton threshold by 2018. 

 
Advanced Nanofibers is currently in the process of introducing to the market its proprietary NanoAdmix™, an advanced one-component admixture consisting of a blend of nanofibers, nanoparticles and/or admixtures for high-performance cementitious composites and coatings.
 
Manufacturing/Production
 
Historically, the high per-unit costs of delivered product have severely dampened the rate at which nanofibers have been used on a wide scale in industrial and consumer products, both domestically throughout the U.S., and globally. This high cost has been attributable to the combination of the high energy requirements for production, on the one hand, and the transport economics stemming from the finished product being, at once, extremely lightweight yet highly voluminous, on the other.
 
The raw nanofibers Advanced Nanofibers is expected to soon be utilizing as a base in the manufacturing of its bonded nanofibers are expected by us to be the highest-grade polymer nanofibers available. What sets Advanced Nanofibers apart at this level is the notably low price-point at which it is expected to be producing this base product – relying on state-of-the-art, super-high-speed melt-blowing machines in relation to which it holds certain partially exclusive supply rights through a contract manufacturer, - which is expected to be approximately 10-20% of what it otherwise costs to produce.
 
After a several month period of planning, an aggressive push is now underway towards the start of production at a facility in Greenville, South Carolina. While unforeseen events in equipment transport, installation and testing may result in delays, production is currently expected to commence during the latter half of Q2 2017.


With regard to the challenges surrounding product transport economics, Advanced Nanofibers believes that its proprietary manufacturing process is one through which nanofiber can be condensed up to roughly 80% from its original (cotton candy-like) agglomerated form, significantly ameliorating the otherwise existing shipping cost burden.

 Historically, the handling of nanofibers and nanoparticles has posed significant health and safety challenges stemming from the potentially hazardous particulates emitted into the air during the production, transport, and use of these materials, and this, too, has been yet another contributing factor in the anemic growth in the wide-scale industrial use of nanoparticle-enhanced nanofibers. This is because the processes applied to working with the nanoparticles have not included anything to effectively contain them from becoming loose, airborne particulates that can get into the eyes and lungs, and onto the skin, of those handling or being around the materials. Because our proprietary bonding process involves the infusing of the nanoparticles to the nanofibers, which, based on other proprietary and applied methodologies, have been chopped and processed in a manner that still leaves them partially agglomerated, the otherwise potentially harmful nanoparticles are constrained and thus unable to become loose, airborne particulates that can get into the eyes and lungs, and onto the skin, of those handling or being around the materials.
 
CORPORATE INFORMATION
 
Corporate Formation, Legacy, History & Subsidiaries 
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 7, 1997 as EJH Entertainment, Inc. On December 4, 1997, a predecessor corporation with the same name as our own but domiciled in Idaho was merged with and into us. Although the predecessor Idaho corporation was without material assets or operations as of the time of the merger, since being organized in 1968, it had historically been involved in mining and entertainment businesses unrelated to our current business.
 
Beginning in 1997, and although we were not then a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act, our common stock was quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board (originally under the symbol “TIXX”, which was later changed to “TIXXD”). On May 13, 1999, we changed our name to FINdex.com, Inc. On March 7, 2000, in an effort to satisfy a then recently imposed NASD Rule eligibility requirement that companies quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board be fully reporting under the Securities Exchange Act (thereby requiring recently audited financial statements) and current in their filing obligations, we acquired, as part of a share exchange in which we issued 150,000 shares of our common stock, all of the outstanding capital stock of Reagan Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation. At the time of this transaction, Reagan Holdings was subject to the requirements of having to file reports pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act, had recently audited financial statements and was current in its reporting obligations. Having no operations, employees, revenues or other business plan at the time, however, it was a public shell company. As a result of this transaction, Reagan Holdings, Inc. became our wholly owned subsidiary and we became the successor issuer to Reagan Holdings for reporting purposes pursuant to Rule 12g-3 of the Securities Exchange Act. Shortly thereafter, we changed our stock symbol to “FIND”. Though it does not currently have any operations, employees, or revenues, Reagan Holdings remains our wholly owned subsidiary.
 
In addition to Reagan Holdings, we also have one other wholly owned subsidiary, Findex.com, Inc. (i.e. the same name as our own), a Delaware corporation. Like Reagan Holdings, this entity, too, does not currently have any operations, employees, or revenues. This subsidiary resulted from an acquisition on April 30, 1999 pursuant to which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of FINdex Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation, from its then stockholders in exchange for 4,700,000 shares of our common stock, which, immediately following the transaction, represented 55% of our total outstanding common stock. Our purpose for this acquisition (under a previous management) was to broaden our then-existing stockholder base, an important factor in our effort to develop a strong market for our common stock. On May 12, 1999, in exchange for the issuance of 457,625 shares of FINdex Acquisition Corp. common stock, FINdex.com, Inc., another Delaware corporation (originally incorporated in December 1995 as FinSource, Ltd.), was merged with and into FINdex Acquisition Corp., with FINdex Acquisition Corp. remaining as the surviving entity. Our purpose for this merger (under a previous management) was to acquire a proprietary financial information search engine for the Internet which was to serve as the cornerstone for a Web-based development-stage business, but which has since been abandoned. As part of the certificate of merger relating to this transaction, FINdex Acquisition Corp. changed its name to FINdex.com, Inc. We currently own 4,700,000 shares of FINdex.com, Inc. (the Delaware corporation), representing 100% of its total outstanding common stock.
 
On July 23, 2014, we merged with EcoSmart Surface & Coating Technologies, Inc., a Florida corporation (“EcoSmart Florida”). Because, for accounting purposes, this merger was treated in accordance with ASC 805-40, Reverse Acquisitions, and Findex was recognized as the accounting acquiree in relation thereto with EcoSmart Florida as the accounting acquirer, our consolidated financial statements for the reporting period from January 1, 2013 through July 23, 2014 were those of EcoSmart Florida, not the enterprise historically recognized as Findex. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements for the periods since July 24, 2014, the day after which the merger was consummated, recognize Findex and EcoSmart Florida as a single operating enterprise and entity for accounting and reporting purposes, albeit with a carryover capital structure inherited from Findex (attributable to the legal structure of the transaction). Readers of this annual report on Form 10-K should note that, in order to provide materially relevant disclosure regarding certain of Findex’s historical, operational expenses not otherwise appropriately accounted for in our consolidated financial statements given the applied accounting treatment described herein, certain disclosure is contained in the text of this report relating to such expenses, including e.g. executive compensation, director compensation, and audit fees, that does not numerically align with the corresponding figures contained in our consolidated financial statements.

 Prior to the merger with EcoSmart Florida, and since 1999, our business had been developing, publishing, marketing, distributing and direct-selling off-the-shelf consumer and organizational software products for the Windows platform. Following divestitures of two software titles which had consistently accounted for the overwhelming majority of our revenues while owned by us, including our Membership Plus product line, which we sold in late 2007, and our flagship QuickVerse product line, which we sold during 2011, and title acquisitions during the same period that, in the aggregate, had been relatively insignificant in offsetting the loss of revenues associated with those major divestitures, our continuing operations, while not nominal, had been very limited and insubstantial in terms of revenue, both relative to what they had been prior thereto and by any appropriate standalone measure. Specifically, our operations immediately prior to the merger with EcoSmart Florida consisted exclusively of those relating to the FormTool line of products which we acquired in February 2008, as well as two language tutorial products, which were retained after the sale of the QuickVerse product line. Due to a continuing lack of capital over a number of years, we were unable to meaningfully grow the FormTool line and develop related products, and our business and financial prospects became increasingly challenged. Since the merger with EcoSmart Florida, our primary focus has shifted away from the continued development of our FormTool line and much more intently in the direction of our surfaces and coatings business, where we believe the opportunities for our future growth are greater and have significantly more to offer economically.
 
In its most recent corporate form, EcoSmart Florida was organized in 2012. The patents and other intellectual property forming the foundation of the EcoSmart business were originally developed during a preceding period dating back to 2003 in which it was operated by the developers of the Company’s technologies as Surface Modification Technologies, Inc. (“SMT”), a Florida corporation, and EcoSmart, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, which were sold together to The Renewable Corporation, a Florida based company with its common stock then traded in the over-the-counter market (“TRC”) in 2012. On January 20, 2012, EcoSmart Coating Technologies, Inc., a Florida corporation, was organized as a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRC. Simultaneously, EcoSmart Surface Technologies, Inc., also a Florida corporation, was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRC. With common ownership by TRC, the assets of each of SMT and EcoSmart, LLC were thereafter transferred in part to EcoSmart Coating Technologies, Inc. with the remainder to EcoSmart Surface Technologies, Inc. On September 18, 2012, EcoSmart Surface Technologies, Inc. changed its name to EcoSmart Surface & Coating Technologies, Inc. On October 19, 2012, EcoSmart Coating Technologies, Inc. was merged with and into EcoSmart Surface & Coating Technologies, Inc., leaving EcoSmart Surface & Coating Technologies, Inc. as the surviving corporation.
 
The Company became the holder of its minority equity stake in Advanced Nanofibers in mid-September, 2016. Through two private holding entities owned jointly with our general counsel, Michael Membrado, and exclusive of indirect interests held through ownership of Company common stock (disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), our president and chief executive officer, Steven Malone, currently holds a combined approximate 10% equity interest in Advanced Nanofibers, primarily through an ownership interest in Nanotech Fibers.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2017, we had eight full-time and two part-time employees/contractors. One full-time employee/contractor is part of the senior-level executive team, two full-time employees/contractors and two part-time employee/contractor are part of the product research and development and business development team, two full-time employee/contractor is part of the marketing, customer service and sales team, one full-time employee/contractor is part of the internal general counsel team, one full-time employee/contractor is part of the manufacturing team, and one full-time employee/contractor is part of the financial management and administration team.
 
We rely heavily on our current officers and directors in operating the business. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and believe that our relationships with our employees/contractors are good.
