ITEM 1.                        DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
Lannett Company, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company, Lannett, we, or us) was incorporated in 1942 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and reincorporated in 1991 as a Delaware corporation.  We primarily develop, manufacture, market and distribute generic versions of brand pharmaceutical products.  We report financial information on a quarterly and fiscal year basis with the most recent being the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.  All references herein to a fiscal year or Fiscal refer to the applicable fiscal year ended June 30.
 
The Company has experienced total net sales growth at a compounded annual growth rate in excess of 27% over the past seventeen years.  In that time period, total net sales increased from $12.1 million in fiscal year 2001 to $684.6 million in fiscal year 2018.  This growth has been achieved through filing and receiving approvals for abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), strategic partnerships and launches of additional manufactured drugs, opportunities resulting from our strong historical record of regulatory compliance, as well as the acquisitions of Silarx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Silarx) and Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals Inc. (KUPI).
 
Most products that we currently manufacture and/or distribute are prescription products.  Our top five products in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 accounted for 58%, 53% and 57% of total net sales, respectively.  On August 20, 2018, the Company announced that its distribution agreement (the JSP Distribution Agreement) with Jerome Stevens Pharmaceuticals (JSP), which expires on March 23, 2019 will not be renewed.  Accordingly, future compounded annual growth rates and top product concentration rates will decline.  Net sales of JSP products, primarily Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets USP, which is one of our top five products, totaled $253.1 million, $187.0 million and $190.4 million in fiscal year 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, or 37%, 30% and 35% of total net sales, respectively.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
Dependable U.S. Based Supplier to our Customers.  We believe we are viewed within the generic pharmaceutical industry as a strong, dependable supplier due in part to our agile and reliable operations network, as well as having a less complex manufacturing/supply chain based mostly within the U.S.  We have cultivated strong and dependable customer relationships by focusing what is important to our customers and patients along with maintaining adequate inventory levels, employing a responsive order filling system and prioritizing timely fulfillment of those orders.  A majority of our orders are filled and shipped on or the day after we receive the order.
Market Orientation.  We believe that our success depends on our ability to properly assess the competitive market for new products, including market share, the number of competitors and the generic unit price erosion.  We intend to reduce our exposure to competitive influences that may negatively affect our sales and profits, including the potential saturation of the market for certain products, by continuing to emphasize maintenance of a strong product selection process with a focus on internal development where we have technological expertise and external development partnerships for other technologies.
Extensive Experience with Productive Partnerships.  We continue to grow, diversify and strengthen our business by entering into partnerships to distribute both externally developed products and authorized generic equivalents of brand products.  In fiscal year 2018, we successfully launched products such as Diclofenac Sodium ER tablets (Voltaren SR®), Metoprolol Succinate ER tablets (Toprol XR®) and Niacin ER tablets (Niaspan®).  We believe that our success with these products, along with existing alliances, has established us as a strong distribution partner creating the foundation for continued productive partnership alliances in the future.
Ability to Develop Successful Products and Achieve Scale in Production.  We believe that our ability to select viable products for development, efficiently develop such products, including obtaining any applicable regulatory approvals and achieve economies of scale in production are critical to our success in the generic pharmaceutical industry.  We intend to focus on long-term profitability driven in part by securing market positions where fewer competitors are expected.
Strong Track Record of Obtaining Regulatory Approvals for New Products.  During the past three fiscal years, we have received 17 approved ANDAs from the Food and Drug Administration (the FDA).  Although the timing of ANDA approvals by the FDA is uncertain, we currently expect to receive several more during Fiscal 2019.  These regulatory approvals will enable us to manufacture and supply a broader portfolio of generic pharmaceutical products.

Efficient Development Systems and Manufacturing Expertise for New Products.  We believe that our manufacturing expertise, low overhead expenses and skilled product development can help us remain competitive in the generic pharmaceutical market.  We intend to dedicate significant capital toward developing new products because we believe our success is linked to our ability to continually introduce new generic products into the marketplace.
Reputation for Regulatory Compliance.  We have a strong track record of regulatory compliance.  We believe that we have strong effective regulatory compliance capabilities and practices due to the hiring of qualified individuals and the implementation of strong current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).  Our agility in responding quickly to market events and a reputation for regulatory compliance position us to avail ourselves of market opportunities as they are presented to us.
 
In addition, narcotics which are classified by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) as controlled drugs are subject to a rigorous regulatory compliance regimen.  We have been granted a license from the DEA to import raw concentrated poppy straw for conversion into commercial APIs.  Such licenses are renewed annually and non-compliance could result in a license not being renewed.  As a result, we believe that our strong reputation for regulatory compliance allows us to have a competitive edge in managing the production and distribution of controlled drugs.
 
Business Strategies
 
Continue to Broaden our Product Lines Through Internal Development and Strategic Partnerships.
 
We are focused on increasing our market share in the generic pharmaceutical industry while concentrating additional resources on the development of new products, including controlled substance products.  We continue to improve our financial performance by expanding our line of generic products, increasing unit sales to current customers, creating manufacturing efficiencies and managing our overhead and administrative costs.
 
We have three primary strategies for expanding our product offerings: (1) deploying our experienced R&D staff to develop products in-house; (2) entering into product development agreements or strategic alliances with third-party product developers and formulators; and (3) purchasing ANDAs or New Drug Applications (NDA) from other manufacturers.  We expect that each strategy will facilitate our identification, selection and development of additional pharmaceutical products that we may distribute through our existing network of customers.
 
Due to the expiration of the JSP Distribution Agreement in March 2019, management is re-assessing its overall business strategies. Although management cannot predict with certainty the precise impact its plans will have on offsetting the loss of the JSP Distribution Agreement, management is continuing to finalize plans to offset the impact of the loss on a short- and long-term basis.  These plans currently include, among other things, an emphasis on reducing cost of sales, R&D and SG&A expenses; continuing to accelerate new product launches; increasing the level of strategic partnerships; and reducing capital expenditures. Management will also continue its emphasis on accelerating ANDA filings.  Management also plans to attempt, at the appropriate time, to refinance a significant portion of its outstanding long-term debt to reduce principal repayment requirements and eliminate existing financial covenants, which will increase related interest expense, but will positively impact cash flows.
 
In certain situations, we may increase our focus on particular specialty markets within the generic pharmaceutical industry.  By narrowing our focus to specialty markets, we can provide product alternatives in categories with relatively fewer market participants.  We plan to strengthen our relationships with strategic partners, including providers of product development research, raw materials, APIs and finished products.  We believe that mutually beneficial strategic relationships in such areas, including potential financing arrangements, partnerships, joint ventures or acquisitions, could enhance our competitive advantages in the generic pharmaceutical market.
 
In Fiscal 2018, the Company filed its first NDA for Numbrino (C-Topical® Solution).
 
In 2016, the Company announced a strategic partnership with YiChang HEC ChangJiang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, an HEC Group company, to co-develop a biosimilar insulin pharmaceutical product for the U.S. market.  The product is currently in development.  The Company plans to manage the clinical and regulatory steps specific for an FDA approval to market and will have the exclusive U.S. marketing rights to the product.  In addition, we will market other generic products developed by HEC with several launches expected over the next few years.
 
We have several existing supply and development agreements with both international and domestic companies; in addition, we are currently in negotiations on similar agreements with additional companies through which we can market and distribute future products.  We intend to capitalize on our strong customer relationships to build our market share for such products.

Mergers and Acquisitions.
 
We evaluate potential mergers and acquisitions opportunities that are a strategic fit and accretive to our business.  During Fiscal 2016, we completed the acquisition of KUPI, the former subsidiary of global biopharmaceuticals company UCB S.A.  KUPI is a U.S. specialty pharmaceuticals manufacturer focused on the development of products that are difficult to formulate or utilize specialized delivery technologies.  Strategic benefits of the acquisition include expanded manufacturing capacity, a diversified product portfolio and pipeline and complementary R&D expertise.
 
Leverage our Flexibility and Speed.
 
We believe flexibility and speed in decision-making are critical success factors in the generic industry.  Our mid-sized scale and relatively less complex organizational structure as a U.S. based organization results in a more nimble response to securing market opportunities.
 
Leverage Ability to Vertically Integrate as a Manufacturer, Supplier and Distributor of Controlled Substance Products.
 
In July 2008, the DEA granted our subsidiary, Cody Labs, a license to directly import concentrated poppy straw for conversion into opioid-based commercial APIs for use in various dosage forms for pain management.  The value of this license comes from the fact that, to date, only a limited number of companies in the U.S. have been granted this license.  This license, along with Cody Labs expertise in API development and manufacture, allows the Company to perform in a market with barriers to entry, no foreign manufactured dosage form competition and limited domestic competition.  Because of this vertical integration, the Company has direct control of its supply and the potential for a more competitive cost position.  The Company can also leverage this vertical integration not only for direct supply of opioid-based APIs, but also for the manufacture of non-opioid-based APIs.
 
The Company believes that the demand for pain management drugs will remain significant as the Baby Boomer generation ages.  By concentrating on a selective portfolio that includes appropriate use pain management medications along with proper customer development, the Company is well-positioned to take advantage of this opportunity. The Company is currently vertically integrated on three products with several others in various stages of development.
 
Key Products
 
Key Products were selected based on current and future sales and profitability.
 
Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets
 
Levothyroxine Sodium tablets, which are used for the treatment of thyroid deficiency by patients of various ages and demographic backgrounds, are the most prescribed drug in the United States.  The product is manufactured by JSP and distributed under the JSP Distribution Agreement and is produced and marketed in 12 potencies. Net sales of Levothyroxine Sodium tablets totaled $245.9 million in fiscal year 2018.  Levothyroxine is a narrow therapeutic index drug and very difficult to formulate and also requires multiple AB ratings to the various brands.  This has resulted in a less competitive market environment for this molecule. In our distribution of these products, we primarily compete with two brand Levothyroxine Sodium products, AbbVies Synthroid® and Pfizers Levoxyl®, as well as generic products from Mylan and Sandoz, each of which have multiple AB ratings as required.  As described above, on August 20, 2018, the Company announced that the JSP Distribution Agreement which expires on March 23, 2019 will not be renewed.
Fluphenazine Tablets
 
Fluphenazine tablets are used for the treatment of schizophrenia and other mental disorders.  Net sales of Fluphenazine tablets totaled $53.3 million in fiscal year 2018.  Currently, our primary generic competitor for this drug is Mylan.
Digoxin Tablets
 
Digoxin tablets, which are used to treat congestive heart failure in patients of various ages and demographics, are produced and marketed with two different potencies. This product is manufactured by JSP and we distribute it under the JSP Distribution Agreement.  Net sales of this product totaled $4.9 million in fiscal year 2018. The product is highly potent based on Environment, Health & Safety (EHS), regulations and its API availability is limited given there are only two active suppliers, based on the FDA Drug Master File (DMF) list.  In our distribution of these products, we compete with generic products from Mylan, Amneal and Hikma, as well as the brand product Lanoxin® distributed by Concordia and an authorized generic (AG) distributed by Endo.  On August 20, 2018, the Company announced that the JSP Distribution Agreement which expires on March 23, 2019 will not be renewed.

Metoprolol Succinate ER Tablets
 
Metoprolol Succinate ER is a beta-blocker that affects the heart and circulation (blood flow through arteries and veins). It is used to treat angina (chest pain) and hypertension (high blood pressure).  It is also used to treat or prevent heart attack.  This product is the generic version of Toprol XL®.  Net sales of Metoprolol Succinate ER totaled $25.9 million in fiscal year 2018.  We compete with generic products from Teva and Dr. Reddys Labs.
Ursodiol Capsules
 
Ursodiol Capsules are produced and marketed in 300 mg capsules and are used for the treatment of gallstones.  Net sales of Ursodiol capsules totaled $20.3 million in fiscal year 2018.  We compete with generic products from Teva, PureCap and Mylan.
Omeprazole Capsules
 
Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that decreases the amount of acid produced in the stomach. The product is a generic version of the branded drug Prilosec®. It is indicated for heartburn or irritation of the esophagus caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease. KUPI produces Omeprazole DR capsules in 10mg, 20mg and 40mg dosages. Net sales of Omeprazole capsules totaled $20.1 million in fiscal year 2018. In distributing this product, we compete primarily with Sandoz, Dr. Reddys Labs, Apotex and Zydus.
Pantoprazole Sodium DR Tablets
 
Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that decreases the amount of acid produced in the stomach.  The product is a generic version of the branded drug Nexium®.  It is indicated for heartburn or irritation of the esophagus caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease. KUPI produces Pantoprazole tablets in 20mg and 40mg dosages.  Net sales of Pantoprazole in fiscal year 2018 were $19.3 million.  We complete primarily with products from Amneal, Aurobindo, Camber, Cadista, Prasco, Teva and Torrent.
Sumatriptan Nasal Spray
 
Sumatriptan Nasal Spray is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks. This product is a generic version of Imitrex® Nasal Spray.  The Company distributes the 5mg and 20mg dosages.  Net sales of Sumatriptan Nasal Spray totaled $42.1 million in fiscal year 2018. We compete with the generic product from Sandoz.
Diclofenac Sodium Tablets
 
Diclofenac Sodium Tablets is a non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) indicated to relieve pain, inflammation and joint stiffness caused by arthritis.  It is the generic version of Voltaren SR®.  We launched this product in the last month of fiscal year 2018 with net sales of $1.1 million.  It is manufactured by Dexcel Pharma and we distribute under our distribution agreement with Dexcel Pharma.  We compete along with the generic product from Oceanside.
Metolazone Tablets
 
Metolazone is a thiazide-like diuretic.  It is primarily used to treat congestive heart failure and high blood pressure.  It is the generic version of Zarocolyn®.  We launched this product in the last month of fiscal year 2018 with net sales of $1.5 million.  We compete with generic products from Mylan and Sandoz.
Methylphenidate Hydrochloride ER
 
Methylphenidate ER is a central nervous system stimulant indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children six years of age and older, adolescents and adults up to the age of 65. The product is a generic version of the branded drug Concerta®, which is currently marketed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc, and competes with a generic product marketed by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, TriGen, Amneal and Mylan as well as an AG marketed by Teva. The product was approved by the FDA in 2013 with a therapeutic equivalence rating of AB, meaning the FDA deemed it therapeutically equivalent to the brand-name drug, Concerta®.  Net sales of Methylphenidate ER tablets totaled $33.2 million in fiscal year 2018.
 
Per a teleconference win November 2014 the FDA informed KUPI that it was changing the therapeutic equivalence rating of its product from AB (therapeutically equivalent) to BX.  A BX-rated drug is a product for which data are insufficient to determine therapeutic equivalence; it is still approved and can be prescribed, but the FDA does not recommend it as automatically substitutable for the brand-name drug at the pharmacy.
 
7




During the November 2014 teleconference, the FDA also asked KUPI to either voluntarily withdraw its product or to conduct new bioequivalence (BE) testing in accordance with the recommendations for demonstrating bioequivalence to Concerta proposed in a new draft BE guidance that the FDA issued earlier that November.  The Company agreed to conduct new BE studies per the new draft BE guidance.  KUPI submitted the data from those studies to the FDA in June 2015 and met with the FDA to discuss the results in July 2015.
 
On October 18, 2016, the Company received notice from the FDA that it will seek to withdraw approval of the Companys ANDA for Methylphenidate ER. The FDAs notice includes an opportunity for the Company to request a hearing on this matter.  Following the Companys request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for documents to support its request for a hearing, the FDA granted an extension to submit all data, information and analyses upon which the request for a hearing relies.  The FDA has not yet made a decision as to whether to grant a hearing to the Company.
 
The Company intends to continue working with the FDA to regain the AB rating, and in the meantime, maintain the drug on the U.S. market with a BX rating.  However, there can be no assurance as to when or if the Company will regain the AB rating or be permitted to remain on the market.  If the Company were to receive the AB rating, net sales of the product could increase subject to market factors existing at that time.  The Company also agreed to potential acquisition-related contingent payments to UCB related to Methylphenidate ER if the FDA reinstates the AB-rating and certain sales thresholds are met.  Such potential contingent payments are set to expire after December 31, 2020.
 
In August 2018, the Company entered into an exclusive perpetual licensing agreement with Andor Pharmaceuticals, LLC for Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended Release (ER) tablets USP (CII) in 18 mg, 27 mg, 36 mg and 54 mg strengths.  Andors pending ANDA of Methylphenidate included all bioequivalence metrics recommended by the FDA and is expected to be approved as an AB-rated generic equivalent to the brand Concerta®.
 
Under the licensing agreement, Lannett will primarily provide sales, marketing and distribution support of Andors Methylphenidate ER product, for which it will receive a percentage of the net profits.  See Note 22 Subsequent events for more information.
 
Pain Management Products
 
Cocaine Topical® Solution (C-Topical®), a vertically integrated product, is produced and marketed under a preliminary new drug application (PIND) in two different strengths and two different size containers.  C-Topical® is utilized primarily for the anesthetization of the patient during ear, nose or throat surgery, sinuplasty and in emergency rooms.
 
In December 2017, a competitor received approval from the FDA to market and sell a Cocaine Hydrochloride topical product.  This approval affects the Companys right to market and sell its unapproved Grandfathered C-Topical product.  According to FDA guidance, the FDA typically allows the marketing of unapproved products for up to one year following the approval of an NDA for the product.  Subsequently, the Company would not be permitted to market and sell its unapproved C-Topical product.
 
The competitors Cocaine Hydrochloride topical product first appeared in FDAs Orange Book in January 2018, and the Orange Book listing was updated in February 2018 to include New Chemical Entity (NCE) exclusivity.  Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, the grant of NCE exclusivity provides that additional applications for approval of the same product under Section 505(b)(2) may not be submitted to the FDA for approval before the expiration of five years from the date of the approval of the first application.  Because the Company submitted its application for approval prior to the date of approval of the competitors Cocaine Hydrochloride topical application, the Company does not believe the NCE exclusivity will apply to the Companys application.  The FDA continues to review the Companys application, and in July 2018 issued a Complete Response Letter which required an additional study and other information.  The Company cannot say for certain when or if the application will be approved.
 
At this time, the Company cannot predict the ultimate impact that these developments will have on its business and financial performance, including but not limited to any possible price reductions should the competitor commence marketing and selling its C-Topical product in the future, for how long the Company will continue to be permitted to market and sell C-Topical or the possible effect on the Companys pending NDA application.
 
Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution is produced and marketed in three different size containers.  We manufacture this product at Cody Labs and are currently finishing the manufacturing methods and capabilities to make the API.  This drug is prescribed primarily for the management of pain in adults.
 
8




Oxycodone HCl Oral Solution (Oxycodone) was produced until August 20, 2012 and marketed until October 4, 2012 in two different size containers, at which point, as a result of FDA enforcement actions against all market participants, the Company voluntarily exited the market.  Prior to the enforcement actions the Company had submitted an ANDA to the FDA and subsequently received approval and commenced shipping Oxycodone in September 2014.  This drug is prescribed primarily for the management and relief of moderate to moderately severe pain.
 
Other products in the pain management franchise include Hydromorphone HCl tablets, which we are vertically integrated, and Codeine Sulfate tablets.  Additionally, the Company added several pain management products through the Silarx acquisition.  Net sales of pain management products totaled $23.0 million in Fiscal Year 2018.
 
Validated Pharmaceutical Capabilities
 
KUPIs 432,000 square foot Seymour, Indiana facility contains approximately 107,000 square feet of manufacturing space as well as a leased 116,000 square foot temperature/humidity controlled storage warehouse.  The Seymour facility has had satisfactory inspections conducted by the FDA and EMA and similar regulatory authorities of Japan, Taiwan, Brazil, China, Korea and Turkey.  Since 2008, KUPI has made significant improvements to its facility and equipment.  These improvements enabled the facility to increase production from approximately 1.2 billion doses in 2008 to over 2.7 billion doses in 2014. Prior to the acquisition, KUPI also completed a 20,000 square foot expansion of the facility which increased capacity to 3.9 billion doses.
 
In connection with the acquisition of Silarx, the Company acquired an 110,000 square foot manufacturing facility located in Carmel, New York, which sits on 25.8 acres of land.  The facility specializes in liquid products and currently houses manufacturing, packaging, quality and research and development and has capacity for additional manufacturing space, if needed.
 
The manufacturing facility of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Cody Labs, consists of a 73,000 square foot structure located on approximately 15.0 acres in Cody, Wyoming.  The Cody Labs manufacturing facility specializes in API and controlled substance production and currently has capacity for further expansion, both inside and outside the existing structure.  In June 2018, the Company announced the Cody Restructuring Plan, as further described in Note 3. Restructuring Charges.
 
Lannett owns several facilities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Certain administrative functions, manufacturing and research and development facilities are located in a 31,000 square foot facility at 9000 State Road, Philadelphia, PA.  A second, 63,000 square foot facility is located within one mile of the State Road facility at 9001 Torresdale Avenue, Philadelphia, PA and contains our analytical research and development and quality control laboratories.  The facility has capacity for additional manufacturing, packaging or laboratory space, if needed.  We also own a building at 13200 Townsend Road in Philadelphia, PA consisting of 66,000 square feet on 7.3 acres of land which is currently used for warehouse space and shipping.  In June 2018, the Company initiated a process to begin consolidating all shipping and receiving activities to its Seymour, Indiana facility.  The consolidation of shipping and receiving will allow us to vacate the 13200 Townsend Road facility in the future.
 
We have adopted many processes in support of regulations relating to cGMPs in the last several years and we believe we are operating our facilities in substantial compliance with the FDAs cGMP regulations.  In designing our facilities, full attention was given to material flow, equipment and automation, quality control and inspection.
 
We continue to pursue Quality by Design for improving and maintaining product quality in our pharmaceutical development and manufacturing facilities, which is outlined in the FDA report entitled, Pharmaceutical Quality for the 21st Century: A Risk-Based Approach.  The FDA periodically inspects our production facilities to determine our compliance with the FDAs manufacturing standards.  Typically, after completing its inspection, the FDA will issue a report, entitled a Form 483, containing observations arising from an inspection.  The FDAs observations may be minor or severe in nature and the degree of severity is generally determined by potential consequences to the consumer. By strictly complying with cGMPs and the various FDA guidelines as well as adherence to our Standard Operating Procedures, we have never received a cGMP Warning Letter in more than 70 years of business.
 
Research and Development Process
 
Over the past several years, we have invested heavily in R&D projects. The costs of these R&D efforts are expensed during the periods incurred.  We believe that such costs may be recovered in future years when we receive approval from the FDA to manufacture and distribute such products.  We have embarked on a plan to grow in future years, which includes organic growth to be achieved through our R&D efforts.  We expect that our growing list of generic products under development will drive future growth.  Over the past several years, we have hired additional personnel in product development, production and formulation.  The following steps outline the numerous stages in the generic drug development process:
 
9




1.)          Formulation and Analytical Method Development.  After a drug candidate is selected for future sale, product development scientists perform various experiments to incorporate excipients with the APIs to product a robust, stable and bioequivalent dosage form that will then, not only be therapeutically equivalent to the brand name drug, but match its size and shape as per FDA guidance.  These experiments will result in the creation of a number of product formulations to determine which formula will be most suitable for our subsequent development process.  Various formulations are tested in the laboratory to measure results against the innovator brand drug.  During this time, we may use reverse engineering methods on samples of the innovator drug to determine the type and quantity of inactive ingredients.  During the formulation phase, our R&D chemists begin to develop an analytical, laboratory testing method.  The successful development of this test method will allow us to test developmental and commercial batches of the product in the future.  All of the information used in the final formulation, including the analytical test methods adopted for the generic drug candidate, will be included as part of the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) section of the ANDA submitted to the FDA.
2.)          Scale-up and Tech Transfer.  After product development, scientists and the R&D chemists agree on a final formulation for use in moving the drug candidate forward in the developmental process, we then attempt to increase the batch size of the product.  The batch size represents the standard magnitude to be used in manufacturing a batch of the product.  The determination of batch size affects the amount of raw material that is used in the manufacturing process and the number of expected dosages to be created during the production cycle.  We attempt to determine batch size based on the amount of active ingredient in each dosage, the available production equipment and unit sales projections.  The scaled-up batch is then generally produced in our commercial manufacturing facilities.  During this manufacturing process, we document the equipment used, the amount of time in each major processing step and any other steps needed to consistently produce a batch of that product.
 
3.)          Bio equivalency and Clinical Testing.  After a successful scale-up of the generic drug batch, we schedule and perform generally required bio equivalency testing on the product and in some cases, clinical testing, if required by the FDA.  These procedures, which are generally outsourced to third parties, include testing the absorption rate and extent of the generic product in the human bloodstream compared to the absorption of the innovator drug.  The results of this testing are then documented and reported to us to determine the success of the generic drug product.  Success, in this context, means that we are able to demonstrate that our product is comparable to the innovator product in dosage form, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use.
 
Bioequivalence (meaning that the product has the same blood levels and dosage form as the innovator drug) and a stable formula are the primary requirements for a generic drug approval (assuming the manufacturing plant is in compliance with the FDAs cGMP regulations).  Lengthy and costly clinical trials proving safety and efficacy, which are required by the FDA for NDAs (and may include 505(b)(2)NDAs), are typically unnecessary for generic companies.  If the results are successful, we will continue the collection of information and documentation for assembly of the drug application.
 
4.)          Submission of the ANDA for FDA Review and Approval.  An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the proposed labeling, active pharmaceutical ingredient, excipients, container/closure, drug product formulation, drug product testing specification, methodology and results.  Bioequivalence study reports are also included in the ANDA submission.
 
Our ANDAs and NDAs are submitted to the FDA electronically using the most current eCTD standards.  Lannett strives to achieve a first cycle approval for each ANDA under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 (GDUFA) review metrics.
 
Sales and Customer Relationships
 
We sell our pharmaceutical products to generic pharmaceutical distributors, drug wholesalers, chain drug retailers, private label distributors, mail-order pharmacies, other pharmaceutical manufacturers, managed care organizations, hospital buying groups, governmental entities and health maintenance organizations.  We promote our products through direct sales, trade shows and bids.  Our practice of maintaining adequate inventory levels, employing a responsive order filling system and prioritizing timely fulfillment of those orders have contributed to a strong reputation among our customers as a dependable supplier of high quality generic pharmaceuticals.
Management
 
We have been focused on enhancing the quality of our management team in anticipation of continuing growth.  As part of our growth, we have established corporate and non-corporate officer positions.  We have hired experienced personnel from large, established, brand pharmaceutical companies as well as competing generic companies to complement the skills and knowledge of the existing management team.  As we continue to grow, additional personnel may need to be added to our management team.  We intend to hire the best people available to expand the knowledge base and expertise within our team.

Unlike brand, innovator companies, we generally do not develop new molecules.  However, we have filed and received two patents for APIs at our Cody, Wyoming manufacturing facility, with additional patents in process.
 
In fiscal year 2018, we received several approvals from the FDA.  The following summary contains more specific details regarding our latest ANDA approvals.  Market data was obtained from Wolters Kluwer and IMS.
 
On July 13, 2017, we received FDA approval for Cyproheptadine Hydrochloride Syrup (Cyproheptadine Hydrochloride Oral Solution, USP) 2 mg/5 mL, the therapeutic equivalent to the reference listed drug, Periactin® Syrup, 2 mg/5 mL of Merck and Co., Inc.

On May 18, 2018, we received FDA approval for Dronabinol Capsules USP, 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg, the therapeutic equivalent to the reference listed drug, Marinol® Capsules 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg of AbbVie Inc.  For the 12 months ended March 2018, total U.S. sales of Dronabinol Capsules USP, 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg, was approximately $120 million, according to IMS.
 
On May 25, 2018, we received FDA approval for Levofloxacin Oral Solution USP, 25 mg/mL, the therapeutic equivalent to the reference listed drug, Levaquin® Oral Solution, 25 mg/mL, of Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. For the 12 months ended April 2018, total U.S. sales of Levofloxacin Oral Solution USP, 25 mg/mL, was approximately $6 million, according to IMS.
 
We have additional products of various dosage forms currently under development.  Our developmental drug products are intended to treat a diverse range of indications.  The products under development are at various stages in the development cycleformulation, scale-up, clinical testing and/or FDA review.
 
The cost associated with each product that we are currently developing is dependent on numerous factors, including but not limited to, the complexity of the active ingredients chemical characteristics, the price of the raw materials and the FDA-mandated requirement of bioequivalence studies (depending on the FDAs Product Specific Guidance).  With the introduction of GDUFA and additional guidance issued by the FDA, the cost to develop a new generic product varies but now totals several million dollars.
 
In addition, we currently own several ANDAs for products that are not currently marketed and noted as Discontinued in FDAs Orange Book.  Occasionally, we review such discontinued products to determine if the market potential for any of these products has recently changed to make it attractive for us to reconsider manufacturing and selling.  If we decide to commercially market one of these products, we evaluate the requirements necessary for commercial launch, including a filing strategy to properly report the relaunch to the FDA so that the product is moved to the Active section of the Orange Book.
 
In addition to the efforts of our internal product development group, we have contracted with numerous outside firms for the formulation and development of several new generic drug products.  These outsourced R&D products are at various stages in the development cycleformulation, analytical method development and testing and manufacturing scale-up.  These products include orally administered solid dosage products, injectables and nasal delivery products that are intended to treat a diverse range of medical indications.
 
We intend to ultimately transfer the formulation technology and manufacturing process for some of these R&D products to our own commercial manufacturing sites.  We initiated these outsourced R&D efforts to complement the progress of our own internal R&D efforts.
 
We recorded R&D expenses of $29.2 million in fiscal year 2018, $42.1 million in fiscal year 2017 and $45.1 million in fiscal year 2016.  These amounts included expenses associated with bioequivalence studies, internal development resources as well as outsourced development.  While we manage all R&D from our principal executive office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, we have also been taking steps to capitalize on favorable development costs in other countries.  We have strategic relationships with various companies that either act as contract research organizations or API suppliers as well as dosage form manufacturers.  In addition, U.S.-based research organizations have been engaged for product development to enhance our internal development.  Fixed payment arrangements are established between Lannett and these research organizations and in some cases include a royalty provision.  Development payments are normally scheduled in advance, based on attaining development milestones.
 
Raw Materials and Finished Goods Suppliers
 
Our use of raw materials in the production process consists of pharmaceutical chemicals in various forms that are generally available from several sources.  In addition to the raw materials we purchase for the production process, we purchase certain finished dosage inventories.  We sell these finished dosage form products directly to our customers along with the finished dosage form products manufactured in-house.  We generally take precautionary measures to avoid a disruption in raw materials and finished goods, such as finding secondary suppliers for certain raw materials or finished goods when available and maintaining adequate inventory levels.
 
The Companys primary finished goods inventory supplier is JSP, in Bohemia, New York.  Purchases of finished goods from JSP accounted for 37% of our inventory purchases in fiscal year 2018, 36% in fiscal year 2017 and 52% in fiscal year 2016.  On March 23, 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with JSP for the exclusive distribution rights in the United States to the current line of JSP products, in exchange for 4.0 million shares of the Companys common stock.  The JSP products covered under the agreement included Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine with Codeine Phosphate Capsules USP; Digoxin Tablets; and Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, sold generically and under the brand-name Unithroid®.  On August 19, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with JSP to extend its initial contract to continue as the exclusive distributor in the United States of three JSP products: Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine with Codeine Phosphate Capsules USP; Digoxin Tablets USP; and Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets USP.  The amendment to the original agreement extended the term of the initial contract, which was due to expire on March 22, 2014, for five years through March 23, 2019.
 
12




In connection with the amendment, the Company issued a total of 1.5 million shares of the Companys common stock to JSP and its designees.  The Company recorded a $20.1 million expense in cost of sales, which represented the fair value of the shares on August 19, 2013.  Both Lannett and JSP have the right to terminate the contract if one of the parties does not cure a material breach of the contract within thirty (30) days of notice from the non-breaching party.  On August 20, 2018, the Company announced that the JSP Distribution Agreement which expires on March 23, 2019 will not be renewed.
 
Over time, we have entered into supply and development agreements with JSP, Summit Bioscience LLC, HEC Pharm Group, Andor Pharmaceuticals LLC, Dexcel Pharma, Aralez Pharmaceuticals (Aralez) and various other international and domestic companies.  The Company is currently in negotiations on similar agreements with other companies and is actively seeking additional strategic partnerships, through which it will market and distribute products manufactured in-house or by third parties.  The Company plans to continue evaluating potential merger and acquisition opportunities as well as product acquisitions that are a strategic fit and accretive to the business.
 
Customers and Marketing
 
We sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors, generic drug distributors, mail-order pharmacies, group purchasing organizations, chain drug stores and other pharmaceutical companies.  The pharmaceutical industrys largest wholesale distributors, Amerisource Bergen, McKesson and Cardinal Health, accounted for 29%, 17% and 5%, respectively, of our total net sales in fiscal year 2018 and 28%, 21% and 6%, respectively, of our total net sales in fiscal year 2017.  Our largest chain drug store customer accounted for 6% and 5% of total net sales in fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017, respectively.
 
Sales to wholesale customers include indirect sales, which represent sales to third-party entities, such as independent pharmacies, managed care organizations, hospitals, nursing homes and group purchasing organizations, collectively referred to as indirect customers.
 
We enter into definitive agreements with our indirect customers to establish pricing for certain covered products.  Under such agreements, the indirect customers independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these agreed-upon prices.  We will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed-upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesalers invoice price.  This credit is called a chargeback. For more information on chargebacks, see the section entitled Critical Accounting Policies in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.  These indirect sale transactions are recorded on our books as sales to wholesale customers.
 
We promote our products through direct sales, trade shows and group purchasing organizations bidding processes.  We also market our products through private label arrangements, under which we manufacture our products with a label containing the name and logo of our customer.  This practice is commonly referred to as private label.  Private label allows us to leverage our internal sales efforts by using the marketing services from other well-respected pharmaceutical competitors.  The focus of our sales efforts is the relationships we create with our customer accounts.
 
Strong and dependable customer relationships have created a positive platform for us to increase our sales volumes.  Historically and in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, our advertising expenses were immaterial.  When our sales representatives make contact with a customer, we will generally offer to supply the customer our products at fixed prices.  If accepted, the customers purchasing department will coordinate the purchase, receipt and distribution of the products throughout its distribution centers and retail outlets.  Once a customer accepts our supply of a product, the customer typically expects a high standard of service, including timely receipt of products ordered, availability of convenient, user-friendly and effective customer service functions and maintaining open lines of communication.
 
We believe that retail-level consumer demand dictates the total volume of sales for various products.  In the event that wholesale and retail customers adjust their purchasing volumes, we believe that consumer demand will be fulfilled by other wholesale or retail sources of supply.  As a result, we attempt to develop and maintain strong relationships with most of the major retail chains, wholesale distributors and mail-order pharmacies in order to facilitate the supply of our products through whatever channel the consumer prefers.  Although we have agreements with customers governing the transaction terms of our sales, generally there are no minimum purchase quantities applicable to these agreements.

Competition
 
The manufacturing and distribution of generic pharmaceutical products is a highly competitive industry.  Competition is based primarily on a reliable supply and price.  In addition to competitive pricing, our competitive advantages are our ability to provide strong and dependable customer service by maintaining adequate inventory levels, employing a responsive order filling system and prioritizing timely fulfillment of orders.  We ensure that our products are available from national wholesale, chain drug and mail-order suppliers as well as our own warehouse.  The modernization of our facilities, hiring of experienced staff and implementation of inventory and quality control programs have improved our competitive cost position.
 
We compete with other manufacturers and marketers of generic and brand-name drugs.  Each product manufactured and/or sold by us has a different set of competitors.  The list below identifies the companies with which we primarily compete with respect to each of our major products in Fiscal 2018:

Government Regulation
 
Pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government, including the FDA and, in cases of controlled substance products the DEA, as well as other federal regulatory bodies and state governments.  The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA), the Controlled Substance Act (the CSA) and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, pricing, advertising and promotion of our generic drug products.  Non-compliance with applicable regulations can result in fines, product recalls and seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, personal and/or corporate prosecution and debarment and refusal of the government to approve NDAs.  The FDA also has the authority to revoke previously approved drug applications.
 
Generally, FDA approval is required before a drug can be marketed.  A new drug is one not generally recognized by qualified experts as safe and effective for its intended use and submitted to FDA as a NDA.  The FDA review process for new drugs is very extensive and requires a substantial investment to research and test the drug candidate.  A less burdensome approval pathway is used for generic drug products, the ANDA.  Typically, the investment required to develop a generic drug is less costly than the new drug. Some drug product may be submitted as a 505(b)(2) NDA, allowing some of the required research and testing to be waived by relying on FDAs previous findings of safety and efficacy and literature.  For additional information on the FDA approval pathways, refer to section 505(b)(1) and 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act for NDAs, section 505(j) for ANDAs and resources available on the FDA website, www.fda.gov.

There are currently three ways to obtain FDA approval of a drug:
 
·                  New Drug Applications (NDA): Unless one of the two procedures discussed in the following sections is available, a manufacturer must conduct and submit to the FDA complete clinical studies to establish a drugs safety and efficacy.  The new drug approval process generally involves:
 
·                  completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing in compliance with the FDAs GLP regulations;
 
·                  submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 
·                  performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use;
 
·                  satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with the FDAs cGMP regulations; and
 
·                  submission to and approval by the FDA of an NDA.
 
The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.  Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent Institutional Review Board.  Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.  These phases generally include:
 
·                  Phase I, during which the drug is introduced into healthy human subjects or, on occasion, patients and is tested for safety, stability, dose tolerance and metabolism;
 
·                  Phase II, during which the drug is introduced into a limited patient population to determine the efficacy of the product in specific targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and
 
·                  Phase III, during which the clinical trial is expanded to a larger and more diverse patient group at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to further evaluate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety.
 
The drug sponsor, the FDA, or the independent Institutional Review Board at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
The results of preclinical animal studies and human clinical studies, together with other detailed information, are submitted to the FDA as part of the NDA.  The NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information.  The FDA may disapprove the NDA if applicable FDA regulatory criteria are not satisfied or it may require additional clinical data.  Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-market regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur or are identified after the product reaches the marketplace.  In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 
The FDA has broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products and withdraw approvals.
 
Satisfaction of FDA new drug approval requirements typically takes several years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.  Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and/or require additional procedures which increase manufacturing costs.  Success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials.  Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval.  Even if a product receives regulatory approval, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.

·                  Abbreviated New Drug Applications: An ANDA is similar to an NDA except that the FDA generally waives the requirement of complete clinical studies of safety and efficacy.  However, it may require bioavailability and bioequivalence studies.  Bioavailability indicates the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of a drug in the bloodstream needed to produce a therapeutic effect.  Bioequivalence compares one drug product with another and indicates if the rate of absorption and the levels of concentration of a generic drug in the body are within prescribed statistical limits to those of a previously approved drug.  Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, an ANDA may be submitted for a drug on the basis that it is the equivalent of an approved drug regardless of when such other drug was approved.  The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product.  A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced innovator drug, if it is intended for a different use, or if it is not subject to an approved Suitability Petition.  However, such a product might be approved under an NDA, with supportive data from clinical trials.
 
In addition to establishing a new ANDA procedure, the Hatch-Waxman Act created statutory protections for approved brand-name drugs.  Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, an ANDA for a generic drug may not be made effective until all relevant product and use patents for the brand-name drug have expired or have been determined to be invalid.  Prior to this act, the FDA gave no consideration to the patent status of a previously approved drug.
 
Upon NDA approval, the FDA lists in its Orange Book the approved drug product and any patents identified by the NDA applicant that relate to the drug product.  Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the FDAs Orange Book before expiration of the referenced patent(s), must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the ANDA has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which the ANDA is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification.  A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA refers.  Before the enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the MMA), which amended the Hatch-Waxman Act, if the NDA holder or patent owner(s) asserted a patent challenge within 45 days of its receipt of the certification notice, the FDA was prevented from approving that ANDA until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in an ANDA applicants favor, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay.  In some cases, NDA owners and patent holders have obtained additional patents for their products after an ANDA had been filed but before that ANDA received final marketing approval and then initiated a new patent challenge, which resulted in more than one 30-month stay.  The MMA amended the Hatch-Waxman Act to eliminate certain unfair advantages of patent holders in the implementation of the Hatch-Waxman Act.  As a result, the NDA owner remains entitled to an automatic 30-month stay if it initiates a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of its receipt of notice of a paragraph IV certification, but only if the patent infringement lawsuit is directed to patents that were listed in the FDAs Orange Book before the ANDA was filed.  An ANDA applicant is now permitted to take legal action to enjoin or prohibit the listing of certain of these patents as a counterclaim in response to a claim by the NDA owner that its patent covers its approved drug product.
 
If an ANDA applicant is the first-to-file a substantially complete ANDA with a paragraph IV certification and provides appropriate notice to the FDA, the NDA holder and all patent owner(s) for a particular generic product, the applicant may be awarded a 180-day period of marketing exclusivity against other companies that subsequently file ANDAs for that same product.  A substantially complete ANDA is one that contains all the information required by the Hatch-Waxman Act and the FDAs regulations, including the results of any required bioequivalence studies.  The FDA may refuse to accept the filing of an ANDA that is not substantially complete or may determine during substantive review of the ANDA that additional information, such as an additional bioequivalence study, is required to support approval.
 
Such a determination may affect an applicants first-to-file status and eligibility for a 180-day period of marketing exclusivity for the generic product.  The MMA also modified the rules governing when the 180-day marketing exclusivity period is triggered or forfeited and shared.  Prior to the legislation, the 180-day marketing exclusivity period was triggered upon the first commercial marketing of the ANDA or a court decision holding the patent invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed.  For ANDAs accepted for filing before March 2000, that court decision had to be final and non-appealable (other than a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari).  In March 2000, the FDA changed its position in response to two court cases that challenged the FDAs original interpretation of what constituted a court decision under the Hatch-Waxman Act.  Under the changed policy, the 180-day marketing exclusivity period began running immediately upon a district court decision holding the patent at issue invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, regardless of whether the ANDA had been approved and the generic product had been marketed.  In codifying the FDAs original policy, the MMA retroactively applies a final and non-appealable court decision trigger for all ANDAs filed before December 8, 2003 leaving intact the first commercial marketing trigger.  As for ANDAs filed after December 8, 2003, the marketing exclusivity period is only triggered upon the first commercial marketing of the ANDA product, but that exclusivity may be forfeited under certain circumstances, including if the ANDA is not marketed within 75 days after a final and non-appealable court decision by the first-to-file or other ANDA applicant, or if the FDA does not tentatively approve the first-to-file applicants ANDA within 30 months.
 
16




In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent market exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA.  If the listed drug is a NCE, the FDA may not accept an ANDA for a bioequivalent product for up to five years following approval of the NDA for the NCE.
 
If the listed drug is not a NCE but the holder of the NDA conducted clinical trials essential to approval of the NDA or a supplement thereto, the FDA may not approve an ANDA for a bioequivalent product before expiration of three years.  Certain other periods of exclusivity may be available if the listed drug is indicated for treatment of a rare disease or is studied for pediatric indications.
 
·                  Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications: For a drug that is identical to a previously approved drug, a prospective manufacturer need not go through the full NDA procedure.  Instead, it may demonstrate safety and efficacy by relying on published literature and reports where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference.  The Hatch-Waxman Act permits the applicant to rely upon certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product.  The manufacturer must also submit, if the FDA so requires, bioavailability or bioequivalence data illustrating that the generic drug formulation produces the same effects, within an acceptable range, as the previously approved innovator drug.  Because published literature to support the safety and efficacy of post-1962 drugs may not be available, this procedure is of limited utility to generic drug manufacturers and the resulting approved product will not be interchangeable with the innovator drug as an ANDA drug would be unless bio equivalency testing were undertaken and approved by FDA.  Moreover, the utility of Section 505(b)(2) applications have with the exception of Grandfathered drugs  been diminished by the availability of the ANDA process, as described above.
 
Additionally, certain products marketed prior to the FDCA may be considered GRASE (Generally Recognized As Safe and Effective) or Grandfathered.  GRASE products are those old drugs that do not require prior approval from FDA in order to be marketed because they are generally recognized as safe and effective based on published scientific literature.  Similarly, Grandfathered products are those which entered the market before the passage of the 1938 act or the 1962 amendments to the act.  Under the grandfather clause, such a product is exempted from the effectiveness requirements [of the act] if its composition and labeling have not changed since 1962 and if, on the day before the 1962 amendments became effective, it was (1) used or sold commercially in the United States, (2) not a new drug as defined by the act at that time and (3) not covered by an effective application.
 
Manufacturing cGMP Requirements
 
Among the requirements for a new drug approval, facilities identified in each application that perform operations related to the drug product, including drug substance manufacturers and outside contract facilities, must conform to FDA cGMP regulations.  The FDA may perform pre-approval inspections to assess a companys compliance with cGMP regulations.  These inspections include reviews of procedures, operations, and data used to support the application and ongoing drug product manufacturing and testing.  FDAs cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance systems as well as the corresponding records and documentation.  In complying with the evolving standards set forth in the cGMP regulations, we must continue to expend time, money and effort in many areas of the company ensure compliance.
 
Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including but not limited to, the seizure of non-complying drug products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and/or civil and criminal penalties.
 
Adverse experiences with the product and certain non-compliance events may need to be reported to the FDA and could result in regulatory actions such as labeling changes or FDA request for application withdrawal or product removal.
 
Other Regulatory Requirements
 
With respect to post-market product advertising and promotion, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet.  The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the FDCA and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter directing entities to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA and state and/or federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions.  Some of our products require participation in Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) programs, including our opioid products. A shared system REMS encompasses multiple prescription drug products and is developed and implemented jointly by two or more companies marketing the same products.  These programs can add significant costs for the Company, depending on market share and complexity of the program.
 
17




We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research.  In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products and withdraw approvals.
 
Any one or a combination of FDA regulatory or enforcement actions against the Company could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
 
DEA Regulation
 
We maintain registrations with the DEA that enable us to receive, manufacture, store, develop, test and distribute controlled substances in connection with our operations.  Controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of five schedules promulgated and administered by the DEA under the CSA.  The CSA governs, among other things, the distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security and disposal of controlled substances.  We are subject to periodic and ongoing inspections by the DEA and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess our ongoing compliance with the DEAs regulations.  Any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions, including the revocation or a denial of renewal of our DEA registration, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.
 
Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
Because of the significant federal funding involved in Medicare and Medicaid, Congress and state legislatures have enacted and actively enforce, a number of laws whose purpose is to eliminate fraud and abuse in federal health care programs.  Our business is subject to compliance with these laws, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Dodd-Frank and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).
Anti-Kickback Statutes and Federal False Claims Act
 
The federal health care programs fraud and abuse law (sometimes referred to as the Anti-Kickback Statute) prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as Medicare or Medicaid.  The definition of remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example gifts, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payment of cash and waivers of payments.  Several courts have interpreted the statutes intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal health care covered business, the statute has been violated.  Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs.  In addition, some kickback allegations have been claimed to violate the Federal False Claims Act, discussed in more detail below.
 
The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry.  Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, Congress authorized the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) to issue a series of regulations, known as safe harbors.  These safe harbors, issued by the OIG beginning in July 1991, set forth provisions that, if all of their applicable requirements are met, will assure health care providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute.  The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued.
 
However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as OIG.
 
Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute.  Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for health care items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on marketing of health care services and products, among other activities and recently have brought cases against companies and certain sales, marketing and executive personnel, for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business.
 
Another development affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the Federal False Claims Act (FFCA) and in particular, action brought pursuant to the FFCAs Whistleblower or Qui Tam provisions.  The FFCA imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program.  The Qui Tam provisions of the FFCA allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery.  In recent years, the number of suits brought against health care providers by private individuals has increased dramatically.  In addition, various states have enacted false claims law analogous to the FFCA, although many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a federal health care program.
 
When an entity is determined to have violated the FFCA, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties.  Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits or causes another to submit a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government.  The federal government has used the FFCA to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals and improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, in addition to the more predictable allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered.  In addition, the federal government has prosecuted companies under the FFCA in connection with off-label promotion of products.  Our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesale or estimated retail prices of our products, the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement of our products and the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.  We are unable to predict whether we will be subject to actions under the FFCA or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions.  However, the costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could significantly affect our financial performance.
 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)
 
The FCPA of 1977, as amended, was enacted for the purpose of making it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business.  Specifically, the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA prohibit the bribery of government officials.
 
HIPAA and Other Fraud and Privacy Regulations
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created two new federal crimes: health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters.  The HIPAA health care fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowing and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors.  A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion from government-sponsored programs.  The HIPAA false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services.  A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines and/or imprisonment.
 
Pricing
 
In the United States, our sales are dependent upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including federal and state programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and private organizations such as commercial health insurance and managed care companies.  Such third-party payors increasingly challenge the price of medical products and services and instituting cost containment measures to control or significantly influence the purchase of medical products and services.
 
Over the past several years, the rising costs of providing health care services has triggered legislation to make certain changes to the way in which pharmaceuticals are covered and reimbursed, particularly by government programs.  For instance, recent federal legislation and regulations have created a voluntary prescription drug benefit, Medicare Part D, which revised the formula used to reimburse health care providers and physicians under Medicare Part B and imposed significant revisions to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.  These changes have resulted in and may continue to result in, coverage and reimbursement restrictions and increased rebate obligations by manufacturers.
 
19




In addition, there continues to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of health care.  Examples of how limits on drug coverage and reimbursement in the United States may cause reduced payments for drugs in the future include:
 
·                  changing Medicare reimbursement methodologies;
 
·                  revising drug rebate calculations under the Medicaid program;
 
·                  reforming drug importation laws;
 
·                  fluctuating decisions on which drugs to include in formularies; and
 
·                  requiring pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies.
 
Also, over the last few years, several states have passed legislation or have proposed legislation that have imposed price reporting requirements for both generic and brand pharmaceutical products and that include price transparency, price increase notification and supplement rebate requirements.
 
We cannot predict the likelihood or pace of such additional changes or whether there will be significant legislative or regulatory reform impacting our products, nor can we predict with precision what effect such governmental measures would have if they were ultimately enacted into law.  However, in general, we believe that legislative and regulatory reform activity likely will continue.
 
Current or future federal or state laws and regulations may influence the prices of drugs and, therefore, could adversely affect the prices that we receive for our products. Programs in existence in certain states seek to set prices of all drugs sold within those states through the regulation and administration of the sale of prescription drugs. Expansion of these programs, in particular, state Medicaid programs, or changes required in the way in which Medicaid rebates are calculated under such programs, could adversely affect the price we receive for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, generic pharmaceutical drug prices have been the focus of increased scrutiny by certain states attorney generals, the U.S. Department of Justice and Congress. Decreases in health care reimbursements or prices of our prescription drugs could limit our ability to sell our products or decrease our revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
The Company believes that under the current regulatory environment, the generic pharmaceutical industry as a whole will be the target of increased governmental scrutiny, especially with respect to state and federal anti-trust and price-fixing claims.
 
See Note 11 Legal, Regulatory Matters and Contingencies for a description of current state and federal anti-trust and price-fixing claims.
 
Other Applicable Laws
 
We are also subject to federal, state and local laws of general applicability, including laws regulating working conditions and the storage, transportation, or discharge of items that may be considered hazardous substances, hazardous waste, or environmental contaminants.  We monitor our compliance with laws and we believe we are in substantial compliance with all regulatory bodies.
 
As a publicly-traded company, we are also subject to significant regulations and laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Since its enactment, we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices and we continue to update the program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements.
