Introduction
 
Consolidated Gems, Inc. ("Consolidated Gems” or the “Company", “we,” “our” or “us”), formerly Electrum International, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was originally incorporated in Florida as We Sell for U Corp. (“We Sell for U”) on November 12, 2007. The principal stockholder of Consolidated Gems is Power Developments Pty Ltd., an Australian corporation (“Power”), an entity majority owned by the Company’s president, which owned 82.85% of Consolidated Gems as of December 31, 2016.
 
In December 2008, Power acquired a 96% interest in Consolidated Gems from Edward T. Farmer and certain other stockholders. Mr. Farmer resigned as Sole Director and Officer of Electrum, Joseph Gutnick was appointed President, Chief Executive Officer and a Director and Peter Lee was appointed Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. Commencing in fiscal 2009, the Company decided to focus its business on energy opportunities.
