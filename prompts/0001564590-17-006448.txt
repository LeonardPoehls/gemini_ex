 Item 1.Business
 Overview
 The principal business of Quorum Health Corporation and its subsidiaries is to provide hospital and outpatient healthcare services in our markets across the United States.  As of December 31, 2016, we owned or leased 36 hospitals in rural and mid-sized markets, consisting of 27 wholly-owned hospitals, four majority-owned hospitals and five leased hospitals, which are located in 16 states and have a total of 3,459 licensed beds.  In addition, through Quorum Health Resources LLC (“QHR”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, we provide a wide range of hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services.  Over 95% of our net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to our hospital operations business and the remainder related to our hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services business.  Our company became an independent, publicly-traded company on April 29, 2016 upon the spin-off (“Spin-off”) of 38 hospitals, their affiliated facilities and QHR from Community Health Systems, Inc. (“CHS” or “Parent” when referring to the carve-out period prior to April 29, 2016).  The terms of the spin-off and related financing transactions, including the transition services agreements between us and CHS, are described below in the section entitled “The Spin-off”.
 As used in this report, the terms (“QHC,” “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us”) refer to Quorum Health Corporation and its subsidiaries.  Quorum Health Corporation is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 2015 to facilitate our Spin-off from Community Health Systems, Inc., as described below.  All references within this Annual Report on Form 10-K to our financial statements, financial data and operating data refer to such data on a consolidated and combined basis unless otherwise noted.  For a definition of consolidated and combined basis, see “Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations”.
 For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated total net operating revenues of $2.1 billion, loss from operations of $285.6 million, net cash provided by operating activities of $81.1 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $162.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures of $181.9 million.  For information regarding why the Company believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures present useful information to investors and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures to net income (loss) attributable to Quorum Health Corporation, the most directly comparable financial measure under United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP” or “GAAP”), see “Item 6 — Selected Financial Data”.  Our net losses in 2016 were primarily due to: (1) $291.9 million of impairment charges related to our hospital operations business, consisting of $166.9 million of impairment to long-lived assets and $125.0 million of impairment to goodwill; (2) a $22.8 million reduction in net operating revenues as a result of a change in estimate related to collectability of patient accounts receivable; (3) higher than expected operating costs associated with the transition services agreements with CHS and other third-party contracts in comparison to the allocated costs from CHS during the carve-out period; and (4) the net operating losses from the hospitals that we have targeted for divestiture (the “divestiture group”), which includes two hospitals divested in December 2016, one hospital divested in March 2017 and an additional six hospitals that we intend to divest in the next twelve months.
 We generate patient revenues from the healthcare services we provide at our hospitals and affiliated outpatient facilities.  Our hospital services include general and acute care, emergency department, general and specialty surgery, critical care, internal medicine, obstetrics, diagnostic, psychiatric and rehabilitation services. We also generate revenues from the outpatient healthcare services we provide at both our hospitals and affiliated outpatient service facilities, including physician practices, urgent care centers, imaging centers and surgery centers, which are located in the same and immediately surrounding communities as our hospitals.  We prioritize building and maintaining a strong presence in the communities where we operate hospitals in collaboration with the local residents, business leaders and governmental agencies.  We continuously seek to improve our market share in each community by building patient loyalty to both our hospitals and physicians and by maintaining a strong reputation for quality of patient care.  In most of our markets, which we generally define as the county where our hospital resides, we are the sole provider of general and acute hospital healthcare services, which means we typically have less direct competition from other hospital companies for our hospital services.  Some of our hospitals are located in markets that are adjacent to highly populated areas where the population, available workforce and demand for healthcare services are likely to continue to grow.  Such factors could increase the demand for healthcare services from our facilities due to the close proximity of our hospitals and outpatient services facilities to these neighboring markets.
 We generate non-patient revenues from our hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services business.  QHR is a leading provider of hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services in the United States.  The clients of QHR are hospitals that are not affiliated with our hospital operations business that enter into contracts with us to receive these non-patient services.  As of December 31, 2016, QHR had contracts to provide management advisory services to 95 hospital clients located in 33 states with a total of approximately 5,700 licensed beds.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, QHR also provided consulting and other support services to approximately 85 hospital clients located in 34 states with a total of approximately 5,100 licensed beds.  By managing and consulting with non-affiliated hospitals that are often located in similar markets as our owned and leased hospitals, we hope to benefit from the opportunity to build relationships and partnerships in these communities and to enhance our knowledge of overall U.S. market conditions beyond those markets in which we currently operate hospitals.  In addition to our non-patient revenues from our QHR business, we generate other non-patient revenues, primarily from rental income and hospital cafeteria sales.

The Spin-off
 On April 29, 2016, Quorum Health Corporation was formed as an independent company through a spin-off from Community Health Systems, Inc. of 38 hospitals, affiliated outpatient service facilities and QHR.  The Spin-off was accomplished through the distribution of 100% of QHC common stock to CHS stockholders of record on April 22, 2016 (the “Record Date”).  Each CHS stockholder received a distribution of one share of QHC common stock for every four shares of CHS common stock held as of the Record Date, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares.  QHC common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “QHC” on May 2, 2016. 
 In connection with the Spin-off, we issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 11.625% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Senior Notes”) on April 22, 2016 and entered into a credit agreement on April 29, 2016, consisting of an $880 million senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) and a $100 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility,” and together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Senior Credit Facility”).  In addition, we entered into a $125 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Credit Facility”).  The net offering proceeds of the Senior Notes, together with the net borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, were used to make a $1.2 billion payment from QHC to CHS and to pay our transaction and financing fees and expenses.  
 In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into certain agreements with CHS that governed or continue to govern matters related to the Spin-off.  These agreements include, among others, a Separation and Distribution Agreement, a Tax Matters Agreement and an Employee Matters Agreement. We also entered into various transition services agreements with CHS that define agreed upon services to be provided by CHS to QHC.  The transition services agreements have five year terms and include, among others, the provision for services related to information technology, payroll processing, certain human resources functions, patient eligibility screening, billing, collections and other revenue management services.
 Pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, CHS made a non-cash capital contribution of $530.6 million and transferred $13.5 million of cash to us on the Spin-off date.  The cash transfer consisted of an agreed upon $20.0 million for the initial funding of our working capital, reduced by $6.5 million for the difference in estimated and actual financing fees and expenses incurred at the closing of the Spin-off.

Our Hospital Operations Business
 Our hospitals and their affiliated outpatient service facilities generate revenues by providing a broad range of general and acute inpatient and outpatient healthcare services to patients living in or traveling to the communities in which we are located.  Each of our hospitals has a corporate board of directors, a board of trustees, or both (in all cases, the “hospital board”), which include members from the local community and the hospital’s medical staff.  The hospital board oversees the operations of the hospital and is responsible for matters such as establishing and monitoring policies related to medical, professional and ethical practices at the hospital and also ensuring these practices conform to U.S. healthcare industry standards and regulatory requirements.  Each of our hospitals has an active quality assurance program to monitor patient safety and quality of care standards at the hospital and its affiliated outpatient service facilities and to meet accreditation and other federal and state regulatory requirements.  Our hospitals conduct patient satisfaction surveys and engage in other quality of care assessment activities that are reviewed and monitored by our senior and hospital management teams on a continuing basis as part of our initiatives to maintain a high-quality reputation in each of the communities we serve.
 The U.S. healthcare industry has been trending in recent years toward treatment of an increasing number of medical conditions in outpatient settings.  We provide outpatient healthcare services at both our hospitals and their affiliated facilities, including physician practices, urgent care centers, imaging centers and surgery centers which we own or lease that are located in the same and immediately surrounding communities as our hospitals.  For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, outpatient healthcare services represented 55.4%, 56.8% and 53.9%, respectively, of our net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts.
 Our Hospital Management Advisory and Healthcare Consulting Services Business
 In addition to the healthcare services provided through our hospitals and their affiliated outpatient service facilities, we also operate QHR, a leader in hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services.
 As of December 31, 2016, QHR had contracts to provide management advisory services to 95 hospital clients located in 33 states with a total of approximately 5,700 licensed beds.  In some cases, we are engaged under these contracts to provide experienced hospital management professionals that are employees of our company to serve as the chief executive officer and chief financial officer for the hospital client on an interim or permanent basis.  As part of the services we provide, our hospital clients receive operations support from QHR corporate and regional management teams.  This service benefits our hospital clients as a result of the broader experience of our QHR corporate and regional management teams in providing services to hospitals of all sizes in diverse markets throughout the United States.
 Our hospital management advisory contracts generally have terms of three to five years.  QHR generates revenues from its management advisory contracts by charging a management advisory fee for its services, which is typically a fixed fee charge agreed upon by QHR and the hospital client’s board of directors and is typically not a calculation based on the hospital client’s revenues or other operating measures.  As specified in the terms of each management advisory contract, QHR is not responsible for hospital licensure, physician credentialing, professional and general liability insurance coverage, capital investments or other functions of the hospital client.  These functions are normally the responsibility of a hospital’s board of directors or board of trustees.  QHR is also not responsible for funding any hospital operating expenses for its hospital clients.  In its capacity as a provider of management advisory services to hospitals, QHR is not considered a healthcare provider for hospital licensure and certificate of need purposes.
 QHR has a nationally recognized consulting services division and promotes healthcare consulting services to hospital clients that do not receive services from its management advisory services business.  QHR generates revenues from its consulting contracts by charging a consulting fee for its services based on the nature, scope and timeline of the services defined for each specific contract.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, QHR had contracts during some or all of the year to provide healthcare consulting and 
 4

other support services to approximately 85 hospitals in 34 states totaling approximately 5,100 licensed beds.  QHR provides consulting services to support a variety of the operational needs hospitals may face including, among others, assistance with revenue and accounts receivable management, electronic health records (“EHR”) management, patient flow management and regulatory compliance management.  QHR also provides consulting services to large, sophisticated medical institutions that contract with us to provide hospital-related advice on specific topics.  
 QHR’s primary services include:
  
• | Hospital Management Advisory and Operations Support. QHR provides hospital and other healthcare organization clients with operational, financial and strategic guidance, as well as interim senior level management when needed. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hospital Group Purchasing. QHR offers group purchasing services to hospitals and other healthcare organizations through its Quorum Purchasing Advantage Program. Through this program, hospital and other healthcare organization clients can enter into a contract with QHR to buy discounted medical supplies, medical equipment, pharmaceuticals and other products and services from the same group purchasing organization used by us for our hospital operations business. QHR also assists with managing its clients supply chain for such purchases when needed. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Online Solutions for Hospitals. QHR offers a suite of web-based applications and software tools through its Vantage App Suite that are designed to support hospital and other healthcare organization clients in their efforts to improve operating and financial performance. These web-based tools are available through online subscriptions and include, among others, applications for measuring productivity, managing medical and drug supply costs, reviewing operating results against benchmark targets for performance and maintaining compliance contracts. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Education Programs. The Quorum Learning Institute educates healthcare leaders, professionals and other medical staff each year, from trustees and senior level management executives to department managers and other staff. It offers programs through national conferences, classroom courses, webinars and online resources. The Quorum Learning Institute programs address current issues in healthcare and provide technical training courses for new and advancing healthcare professionals and medical staff.

Business Strategy
 Our business strategy is to grow our revenues and operating margins by implementing and executing initiatives to expand specialty care and outpatient service lines at each of our hospitals, effectively utilize physician recruitment programs to identify and attract talented physicians and medical staff, and enhance patient safety, quality of care and satisfaction in the services we provide.  We continuously aim to manage our operating costs, primarily through the efficient management of staffing and medical supply inventory levels at each of our hospitals.  In addition, our strategic initiatives include investing capital in renovations, expansion, medical-related technology and equipment at our existing healthcare facilities and also in acquiring new healthcare facilities.  Our goal is to increase our market share in each of the communities we serve and to further expand our overall market share by attracting out-of-market patients to our healthcare facilities.  As part of our efforts to accomplish these goals, we operate our healthcare facilities in accordance with the following strategic objectives:

• | refine our portfolio to include high-quality, profitable hospitals and outpatient service facilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expand the breadth and capacity of the specialty care service lines and outpatient services we offer;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enhance patient safety, quality of care and satisfaction at our healthcare facilities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve the operating and financial performance of our hospital operations business;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve financial results by pursuing the sale of underperforming hospitals; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | grow our revenues through selective acquisitions.
--+--------------------------------------------------

Refine our Portfolio to Include High-Quality, Profitable Hospitals and Outpatient Service Facilities
 We are refining our portfolio of hospitals and outpatient service facilities, primarily by divesting underperforming businesses, with the goal of improving market share in each of the communities we serve.  In most of our markets, which we generally define as the county where our hospital resides, we are the sole provider of general and acute hospital healthcare services.  We monitor the unique aspects of the individual communities we serve and utilize hospital-specific operating and marketing strategies to achieve our goals and benefit these communities.  By focusing on building strong community, physician and employee relationships and by establishing strong local market leadership teams at our hospitals and outpatient service facilities, we believe we can enhance our delivery of high-quality healthcare services and improve operating performance at our hospitals and outpatient service facilities.  We have local management leadership teams at each of our hospitals and additionally have local physician and clinical leadership groups in each of our markets.  We aim to achieve a high level of presence and involvement in the communities we serve and to further our development of good relationships with local residents, business leaders and governmental agencies.  We empower our individual hospital management teams to develop comprehensive strategic plans that position their respective hospitals to meet the unique 
 5

healthcare needs of their local community and to look for opportunities to grow market share through selective acquisitions or the opening of new outpatient service facilities, including physician practices. We believe we have developed a reputation for partnering with the local communities of our hospitals to grow both the specialty care service lines and medical technology available to patients.
 Expand the Breadth and Capacity of the Specialty Care Service Lines and Outpatient Services We Offer
 Each of our markets has unique healthcare needs and gaps in available specialty care service lines and we assess these needs on an ongoing basis to prioritize our recruitment efforts.  We are focused on the execution of effective primary care and specialty care physician retention and recruitment programs, and additionally non-physician recruitment and retention programs, at each of our hospitals for the purpose of building and maintaining the confidence of community residents in the stability and breadth of medical treatment available to them locally through our healthcare facilities.  We invest capital in new and existing specialty care service lines and medical technology at our hospitals to continuously improve and enhance the quality of care experienced by our patients and with the intent of reducing the potential migration of our patients and local community residents to competing in-market and out-of-market providers.  We also invest capital to expand our outpatient service line offerings.  We believe this widens the catchment area for our hospitals and is consistent with prevailing market drivers in the U.S. healthcare industry, including patient preference for a convenient medical treatment facility, physician preference toward the increased efficiency of utilizing non-hospital settings when available, and both patient and third-party payor preferences toward the typically lower cost of care in outpatient settings.  In particular, we are targeting four specialties, which are orthopedics, general surgery, gastroenterology and cardiology. We anticipate the addition of these services will bolster utilization and increase acuity of our services, as measured by case mix index and revenues per case.
Enhance Patient Safety, Quality of Care and Satisfaction at our Healthcare Facilities
 Clinical quality is a high priority for us.  We have various programs that support our hospitals and outpatient service facilities to continuously improve the safety, quality of care and satisfaction of patients receiving services from us.  As an example, we maintain active safety and quality training programs for our senior hospital management, chief nursing officers, quality control directors, physicians and other medical staff at our healthcare facilities. We also have programs that focus on sharing information among our hospital management teams to align best practices in medical treatment, operations and regulatory compliance.  We seek to provide our hospitals with the infrastructure and technological capability to deliver high-quality care to patients.  We believe measurements of patient, physician, medical staff and employee satisfaction provide important insight for our hospital leadership teams into the quality of care being administered to patients.  Each of our hospitals conducts patient, physician, medical staff and employee satisfaction surveys to identify methods and opportunities for improving patient safety, quality of care and satisfaction.   In addition, we have standardized many of our processes for documenting compliance with accreditation requirements and clinical best practices that have positive track records in leading to improved patient experiences at our healthcare facilities.  For example, we established a baseline at each of our hospitals in April 2013 for monitoring the Serious Safety Event Rate.  As of September 30, 2016, we have reported 80% fewer serious safety events in comparison to our baseline in 2013.
Improve the Operating and Financial Performance of our Hospital Operations Business
 We intend to improve the operating and financial performance at each of our hospitals and outpatient service facilities through frequent and ongoing evaluation of our operations, focusing on hospital-specific strategic initiatives, growing revenues by expanding specialty care and outpatient service line offerings, controlling operating costs and aligning incentive compensation with operating and financial performance to reward our hospital management teams.  In general, we believe our opportunities for improving operating and financial performance are hospital-specific and we intend to provide our hospital management teams with the autonomy to develop an operating and marketing strategy tailored to the individual community they serve.  Our strategic initiatives and operating cost control efforts include tasks such as continuously focusing on revenue cycle management and collections, adhering to established protocols related to medical supplies utilization, monitoring medical staffing levels and reducing contract labor usage. We believe these efforts, in combination with other initiatives aimed at improving our operating and financial performance, should lead to improved cash flow generation for us in the future.
Improve Financial Results by Pursuing the Sale of Underperforming Hospitals
 We perform an ongoing strategic review of our hospitals based upon an analysis of financial performance, current competitive conditions, market demographic and economic trends, joint venture opportunities and capital allocation requirements to assess our overall portfolio of hospitals.  As part of this strategy, we engage in initiatives to divest underperforming hospitals and outpatient service facilities which, in turn, we believe will allow us to reduce our corporate indebtedness and refine our hospital portfolio to become a sustainable group of hospitals and outpatient service facilities with higher operating margins.  We will continue to pursue divestiture opportunities that align with this strategy.
 On March 31, 2017, we sold 60-bed Cherokee Medical Center and its affiliated outpatient facilities (“Cherokee”), located in Centre, Alabama, for $4.3 million.  For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our operating results included pre-tax losses of $5.0 million, $5.3 million and $4.2 million related to Cherokee.  In addition to the above, we recorded $3.9 million and $2.0 million of impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of Cherokee during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We do not expect the loss on sale of this hospital will be material, after consideration of the impairment charges recorded in 2016.
 6

On March 30, 2017, we announced that we have a definitive agreement to sell 231-bed Trinity Hospital of Augusta and its affiliated outpatient facilities (“Trinity”), located in Augusta, Georgia.  We currently anticipate completing the sale of this hospital in the second quarter of 2017.  
 On December 31, 2016, we sold 56-bed Barrow Regional Medical Center and its affiliated outpatient facilities (“Barrow”), located in Winder, Georgia, for $6.6 million.  For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our operating results included pre-tax losses of $14.5 million, $6.2 million and $3.9 million related to Barrow.  In addition to the above, we recorded a $1.2 million net loss on the sale and $4.0 million of impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of Barrow during the year ended December 31, 2016.  
 On December 1, 2016, we sold 64-bed Sandhills Regional Medical Center and its affiliated outpatient facilities (“Sandhills”), located in Hamlet, North Carolina, for $7.2 million.  For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our operating results included pre-tax losses of $6.9 million, $2.0 million and $2.3 million related to Sandhills. In addition to the above, we recorded a $1.0 million net loss on the sale and $4.8 million of impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of Sandhills during the year ended December 31, 2016.
 We utilized the proceeds from the three completed divestitures to pay down our Term Loan Facility.  Our strategic review process is ongoing and we have targeted six additional hospitals for divestiture with the intent of utilizing all proceeds to pay down our secured debt.  We intend to divest these hospitals in the next twelve months.  We may be unable to divest or realize proceeds from the sale of any or all hospitals we consider for divestiture.  We may also be subject to additional impairment charges in the future as a result of our ongoing strategic review process.
 Grow our Revenues through Selective Acquisitions
 As part of our business strategy, we seek attractive hospital acquisition opportunities meeting the following criteria:
  
• | located in cities and counties with stable, growing populations and positive economic trends;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | currently operate as tax-exempt (not-for-profit) hospitals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | present opportunities for capacity and service line expansion; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | align with our goals for improving overall operating and financial performance.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also seek to acquire selective outpatient service facilities, primarily physician practices, located in the same and immediately surrounding communities as our existing hospitals and will invest capital into building new outpatient service facilities when needed.  We believe these strategic in-market initiatives will further strengthen our community relationships and benefit our patients and the community residents through increased availability of local specialty care and outpatient service lines.
 Competition
 The U.S. healthcare industry is highly competitive.  Our business strategy includes pursuing selective acquisitions of hospitals in markets new to us.  We face competition from other for-profit hospital companies and from not-for-profit hospital entities that generally seek to acquire the same types of hospitals as us.  In addition, some hospitals are sold at auctions, which may result in higher purchase prices than we believe are reasonable.
 We face competition from other healthcare providers for patients.  We utilize both employee and non-employee physicians at our hospitals and outpatient service facilities.  Our non-employee physicians, in most cases, also provide services at healthcare facilities not owned by us.  We seek to attract our physicians’ patients to our facilities by maintaining a reputation for high quality of care and patient satisfaction, providing convenient inpatient and outpatient settings for the delivery of healthcare services, and ensuring that we invest in technologically advanced medical equipment.  Our ability to effectively compete for patients is impacted by commercial and managed care payor programs that influence patient choice by offering health insurance plans that restrict patient choice of provider.  For example, plans with narrow network structures restrict the number of participating in-network provider plans and plans with tiered network structures impose higher cost-sharing obligations on patients who obtain services from providers in a disfavored tier.
 In most of our markets, which we generally define as the county where our hospital resides, we are the sole provider of general and acute hospital healthcare services, which means we typically have less direct competition for our hospital services.  Our hospitals face competition from out-of-market hospitals, including hospitals in urban areas that may have more comprehensive specialty care service lines, more advanced medical equipment and technology, more extensive medical research capabilities and resources or greater access to medical education programs.  Patients in the markets where we operate hospitals may travel to out-of-market hospitals to seek medical treatment for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, the need for services we do not offer or as a result of a physician referral.  Patients who seek medical treatment from an out-of-market hospital may subsequently shift their preferences to that hospital for future healthcare services.  We also face competition from other specialty care providers, including outpatient surgery, orthopedic, oncology and diagnostic centers that are not affiliated with us.  Our hospitals and many of the hospitals with whom we compete engage in physician alignment strategies, which may include employing physicians, acquiring physician 
 7

practice groups, and participating in Accountable Care Organizations (“ACOs”) and, to the extent permitted by law, physician ownership of healthcare facilities.
 In our markets where we are not the sole provider of general and acute hospital healthcare services, our primary competitor is generally a not-for-profit hospital.  Not-for-profit hospitals are typically owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or not-for-profit entities that are financially supported by endowments and charitable contributions.  Not-for-profit hospitals do not pay income or property taxes and are able to make capital investments without paying sales tax. These financial advantages may better position such hospitals to maintain more modern and technologically upgraded healthcare facilities and equipment and to offer more specialized healthcare services than those available at our hospitals.
 The trend toward increasing clinical transparency and value-based purchasing within the U.S. healthcare industry may have an adverse impact on our competitive position and patient admissions volumes in ways that we are unable to predict.  For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), requires hospitals to publish or make available to the public their standard charges for healthcare services.  In addition, CMS publicizes on its Hospital Compare website certain data submitted by hospitals in connection with Medicare reimbursement claims, which includes individual hospital performance data related to quality of care measures and patient satisfaction surveys.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 In the rural and mid-sized markets where we operate, we believe we have strengths in our hospital operations that differentiate us from our competitors, including our commitment and ability to respond to the demand for better access to high-quality patient care, improved patient experience through the entire treatment and billing process and continuous improvement in clinical quality.  We believe our competitive strengths are summarized as follows:

• | strong presence in the communities we serve;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | geographically diversified hospital portfolio;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | track record of continuous improvement in clinical quality, safety and patient experience; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | dedicated and experienced management teams.
--+--------------------------------------------

Strong Presence in the Communities We Serve
 Our hospitals are the sole providers of general and acute hospital healthcare services in most of the markets we serve throughout the United States.  These communities rely on our hospitals for access to quality healthcare services, as well as to make a positive societal and economic impact in their regions. Our hospitals are dedicated to providing local employment opportunities, engaging in local sponsorships and offering community health education through lecture programs, health fairs and screening events. 
Geographically Diversified Hospital Portfolio
 We have a geographically diversified portfolio of 36 hospitals located across 16 states.  Many of our hospitals operate in markets experiencing population growth.  We believe our existing hospital portfolio is geographically well-positioned to adapt to ongoing changes in the U.S. healthcare industry and to respond to individual community needs related to healthcare services.  Additionally, as part of our business strategy and to enhance our long-term growth, we are actively engaged in refining our hospital portfolio, primarily by divesting underperforming hospitals. In December 2016, we completed the sales of two hospitals, Sandhills and Barrow, located in North Carolina and Georgia, respectively.
Track Record of Continuous Improvement in Clinical Quality, Safety and Patient Experience
 We are committed to providing a high-quality and cost-effective healthcare experience for patients in collaboration with our physicians, medical staff and third-party payors.  We have continued to see a reduction in our Serious Safety Events, as last reported through September 30, 2016, with an 80% reduction from our 2013 baseline.  Our hospitals continually strive to achieve clinical excellence designations, such as Chest Pain Center accreditation by the Society of Cardiovascular Patient Care and Primary Stroke Center accreditation by The Joint Commission.
Dedicated and Experienced Management Teams
 Our dedicated senior management team has significant public company and hospital operations experience, including a proven track record of acquiring and integrating hospitals. We believe the breadth of healthcare industry expertise and experience from both our senior management team and the management teams at each of our hospitals will drive our long-term growth.

U.S. Healthcare Industry
 Overview
 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) reported that total U.S. healthcare expenditures in 2015 grew by 5.8% to approximately $3.2 trillion. CMS projections published in 2017, which do not take into account initiatives or programs that may result from the 2016 federal elections, indicate that total U.S. healthcare spending will grow at an average annual rate of 5.9% for 2018 through 2019. CMS also projected that total U.S. healthcare spending will grow by an average of 5.8% annually from 2020 through 2025, exceeding $5.5 trillion by 2025 and accounting for approximately 19.9% of the total U.S. gross domestic product. CMS expects healthcare spending to be largely influenced by changes in economic growth and population aging, and anticipates faster growth in medical prices.
 Hospital care, the category within the U.S. healthcare industry in which we classify our hospital operations business, is the largest category of U.S. healthcare expenditures.  The hospital care category is also broadly defined to include services provided at acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric healthcare facilities that are owned by the government or investors or that operate as not-for-profit facilities.  CMS defines the hospital care category to include all services provided by hospitals to patients.  Services include room and board, ancillary charges, services of employed physicians, inpatient pharmacy, hospital-based nursing home, home health care and any other service billed by hospitals in the United States for patient care.  In 2016, hospital care expenditures are projected to have grown 4.9%, amounting to over $1 trillion. CMS estimates that the hospital services category will exceed $1.1 trillion in 2017, and projects growth in this category at an average of 5.5% annually from 2016 through 2025.  According to the American Hospital Association, as of January 2017, there are approximately 4,862 community hospitals in the United States and approximately 1,829 of these hospitals are located in rural communities, which are the primary markets in which we operate hospitals.
 Demographic Trends
 According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2015, the U.S. population included approximately 47.8 million people living in the United States age 65 or older, comprising 14.9% of the total U.S. population.  By 2030, the U.S. Census Bureau predicts the number of people age 65 or older living in the United States will increase to approximately 74.1 million, or 20.6% of the total U.S. population.  Due to increasing life expectancy, people living in the United States age 85 or older is also expected to increase from approximately 6.3 million in 2015 to 9.1 million by 2030.  The increase in life expectancy is expected to increase the demand for healthcare services and, as importantly, the demand for more innovative means of delivering healthcare services.  The hospital care category of the U.S. healthcare industry will likely benefit the most from these increases in demand related to healthcare services.
 Based on U.S. Census Bureau data compiled by us for the specific markets in which we operate hospitals, the number of people living in our service areas grew 0.9% from 2011 to 2016 and is expected to grow 1.3% from 2016 to 2021.  The national average population growth was 4.4% and 3.7% for these respective periods.  The number of people age 65 or older living in our service areas grew 16.2% from 2011 to 2016 and is expected to grow 14.7% from 2016 to 2021.  The national average population growth for people age 65 or older was 20.7% and 17.6% for these respective periods.  The number of people age 65 or older living in our service areas comprised 15.6% of the total population in our service areas in 2016 and is expected to comprise 17.7% of the total population in these same service areas by 2021.  The number of people age 65 or older living in the United States was 15.1% and 17.1% for these respective periods.  On a similar basis, the number of people age 85 or older in our service areas grew 10.7% from 2011 to 2016 and is expected to grow 5.4% from 2016 to 2021.  The national average population growth for people age 85 or older was 13.4% and 5.7% for these respective periods.  The number of people age 85 or older living in our service areas comprised 1.9% of the total population in our service areas in 2016 and is expected to comprise 2.0% of the total population in these same service areas by 2021.  The number of people age 85 or older living in the United States was 1.9% and 2.0% for these respective periods.  
 Hospital Consolidation Trends
 Various sectors of the U.S. healthcare industry are experiencing consolidation activity in reaction to efforts to reform the overall reimbursement payment system.  We believe that consolidation activity in the hospital care category will continue to be a trend of the U.S. healthcare industry in the future.  The majority of consolidations occur through mergers and acquisitions of municipal or not-for-profit hospital systems that are acquired by for-profit hospital systems.  Reasons for this consolidation activity generally include the following:

• | desire to enhance the quality of care and breadth of local healthcare service lines available in communities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | need for additional recruitment of specialty care and primary care physicians or other medical staff;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | general economies of scale, such as those that can be achieved through contracting for medical and drug supply purchase agreements and professional and general liability insurance coverage as a combined hospital system;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mitigating risks associated with ongoing changes in reimbursement rates available from both governmental and non-governmental third-party payors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
9

 
• | changes to healthcare reimbursement payment models that more closely tie reimbursement rates to the cost-effective delivery of patient services and the quality of care administered to patients; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other ongoing regulatory changes within the U.S. healthcare industry.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Hospital companies are acquiring an increasing number of physician practices and other outpatient service facilities as part of their physician alignment strategies to position themselves for readmissions, payment bundling and other payment restructuring models. Similarly, commercial and non-governmental managed care third-party payors have been consolidating and, in some cases, acquiring complementary service providers in an effort to offer more competitive programs.
 Payment Trends
 In recent years, the Affordable Care Act and the consolidation activity within the U.S. healthcare industry, among other factors, have resulted in higher deductible and co-payment requirements due from patients, which in turn have increased financial risk for hospitals.  The amount of uncollectible patient account balances is expected to increase in response to rising medical prices and to greater financial burden on insured patients.  These increases may be partially offset by the reduction in costs associated with previously uninsured patients benefiting from Medicaid expansion due to the Affordable Care Act, but it is unclear whether this expansion will remain in effect.
Outpatient Services Trends
 In recent years, hospitals have experienced an increase in the percentage of total revenues associated with outpatient healthcare services.  This shift in revenues is primarily attributable to advances in medical technology, which have permitted more procedures to be performed in an outpatient setting.  In addition, increased pressure from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, commercial health insurance companies and managed care plans to reduce the number of days a patient stays in the hospital has also contributed to the increase in outpatient healthcare services.  Patients and third-party payors have been seeking services through outpatient service facilities on an increasing basis as the number of outpatient service facilities and the types of services available through outpatient service facilities increase.  Certain third-party payors are imposing limitations and adjusting coverage of inpatient services for types of services currently available in outpatient settings.  For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, outpatient healthcare services represented 55.4%, 56.8% and 53.9%, respectively, of our net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts.  We expect the percentage of total revenues attributable to outpatient healthcare services will continue to increase in the future and will, in turn, inhibit the growth of inpatient admissions at our hospitals.
Health Insurance Coverage Trends
 The Affordable Care Act, as currently structured, mandates that substantially all U.S. citizens maintain health insurance coverage, while expanding access to coverage through a combination of private sector health insurance reforms and public program expansion. In recent years, most of the states that have experienced the greatest reductions in rates of uninsured individuals have been those that expanded Medicaid coverage and established health insurance exchanges (“Exchanges”) at the state level.   The outcome of the 2016 federal elections cast considerable uncertainty on the future of the Affordable Care Act, and, although some states are considering expanding their Medicaid programs, it is unclear whether the trend of increased coverage will continue.  In addition, several private health insurers have withdrawn, or have announced their intent to withdraw, from the Exchanges, which may threaten the stability of those marketplaces.
Revenues
 We generate revenues by providing healthcare services at our hospitals and their affiliated outpatient service facilities to patients seeking medical treatment.  Hospital revenues depend on, among other factors, inpatient occupancy and acuity levels, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges and negotiated payment rates for the healthcare services provided.  Our primary sources of payment for the healthcare services we provide to patients are from third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid programs, Medicare and Medicaid managed care programs, commercial insurance companies, other managed care programs, workers’ compensation carriers and employers.  Self-pay revenues are the portion of our revenues generated from providing healthcare services to patients who do not have health insurance coverage as well as the patient responsibility portion of charges that are not covered for an individual by a health insurance program or plan.  Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than collection of amounts due from government or other non-government third-party payors.  We generate non-patient revenues from our hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services business, rental income and hospital cafeteria sales.
 Our operating revenues related to our hospital operations business are adjusted for contractual allowances, or differences in our standard charges for the healthcare services we provide and the reimbursement rates that we will ultimately receive as payment for these services.  Standard charges and reimbursement rates for routine inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of medical procedure performed and the geographical location of the hospital.  The reimbursements we ultimately receive as payments for services are determined for each patient instance of care, based on the contractual terms we negotiate with third-party payors or based on federal and state regulations related to governmental healthcare programs.  We record contractual allowance in the period in which services are performed and the patient’s method of payment is verified.  Except for emergency department services, our policy is to determine the payment methodology with patients prior to when the services are performed.  Estimates for contractual allowances 
 10

are subject to change, in large part, due to ongoing contract negotiations and regulation changes, which are typical in the U.S. healthcare industry.  Revisions to estimates are recorded in the periods in which they become known and may be subject to further revisions.  Additional revisions to estimates may be made in future periods as they become known. Self-pay and other third-party payor discounts are incentives offered to uninsured or underinsured patients or other payors to reduce their costs of healthcare services with the purpose of maximizing our collection efforts.
 As of December 31, 2016, we recorded a change in estimate of $22.8 million to reduce the net realizable value of our patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted both contractual allowances and the provision for bad debts in our statements of income.  The portion of this change in estimate that impacted contractual allowances was $11.4 million and related to increasing delays associated with collections on accounts receivable under the Illinois Medicaid program.  The remainder of the change in estimate, also $11.4 million, impacted the provision for bad debts and related to our assessment of the collectability of our managed care and commercial accounts receivable aged greater than one year based on a review of historical cash collections for these accounts.
 A summary of our net operating revenues, before the provision for bad debts, by payor source follows (dollars in thousands):
  
 | Year Ended December 31, | 
-----------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+----------
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 
 | $ Amount | | % of Total | | $ Amount | | % of Total | $ Amount | | | % of Total | 
Medicare | $ | 673,074 | | 27.8 | % | $ | 656,799 | | 26.9 | % | | $ | 681,010 | 28.3 | %
Medicaid | | 446,273 | | 18.4 | % | | 443,479 | | 18.1 | % | | | 420,050 | 17.4 | %
Managed care and commercial | | 952,535 | | 39.4 | % | | 984,480 | | 40.3 | % | | | 907,667 | 37.7 | %
Self-pay | | 242,095 | | 10.1 | % | | 247,234 | | 10.0 | % | | | 287,470 | 11.9 | %
Non-patient | | 105,076 | | 4.3 | % | | 113,866 | | 4.7 | % | | | 113,805 | 4.7 | %
Total net operating revenues, before the provision for bad debts | $ | 2,419,053 | | 100.0 | % | $ | 2,445,858 | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 2,410,002 | 100.0 | %

 The table above includes an $11.4 million change in estimate we recorded as of December 31, 2016 to reduce the net realizable value of patient accounts receivable due to increasing delays associated with collections on accounts receivable under the Illinois Medicaid program, as described above.  This portion of the change in estimate impacted contractual allowances associated with Medicaid revenues.
 In 2016, we began classifying our revenues related to Medicare Advantage Plans as Medicare revenues.  As a result, we retroactively reclassified those amounts from managed care and commercial revenues to Medicare revenues for all periods presented in the table above.  For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Medicare revenues related to Medicare Advantage Plans were $170.4 million, $146.9 million and $133.0 million, respectively, or 25.3%, 22.4% and 19.5% as a percentage of total Medicare revenues, respectively.  Revenues from Medicaid managed care programs are included in Medicaid revenues in the table above, which is consistent with our presentation in prior periods.  See Note 2 — Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies — Reclassifications in the accompanying financial statements.
 Charity Care
 In the ordinary course of business, we provide healthcare services to patients who are financially unable to pay for care and do not qualify for coverage under a governmental program. We assess the eligibility of these patients for charity care services primarily based on a patient’s household income relative to the poverty level guidelines established by the federal government.  We record the gross charges for charity care services at our standard billing rates as self-pay revenues and fully offset these charges in contractual allowances in the same period.  We do not record a provision for bad debts related to these charges, as it is our policy not to pursue collection of payments from charity care patients.  To the extent we receive reimbursement payments through a governmental assistance program to subsidize the care provided, we reduce both the self-pay revenues and the contractual allowance for the related service.  Charity care services have no net impact to our net operating revenues.
Provision for Bad Debts
 To provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future, we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of our receivables to their estimated net realizable value.  The primary uncertainty in collectability of our revenues relates to uninsured patients and the patient financial responsibility portion of payments due from insured patients.  Collections are impacted by the economic ability of patients to pay, the effectiveness of CHS’ collection efforts pursuant to our transition services agreements with them, and our own collection efforts.  Significant changes in payor mix, business office operations, economic conditions, or trends in federal and state governmental healthcare coverage, among other things, could affect our collection levels and are considered in our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts.  See “Item 1.  Business — Agreements with CHS Related to the Spin-off” for additional information on the transition services agreements.
 11

We have an established process to determine the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts that relies on a number of analytical tools and benchmarks.  No single statistic or measurement determines the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Some of the analytical tools we utilize include, but are not limited to, monitoring historical cash collections experience, revenue trends by payor classification and days revenue outstanding.  As discussed above, we recorded a change in estimate as of December 31, 2016 to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of our assessment of the collectability of our managed care and commercial accounts receivable aged greater than one year based on a review of historical cash collections for these accounts.
 Reimbursement under Governmental Healthcare Programs
 We receive payments for a substantial portion of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including Medicare managed care plans, known as Medicare Advantage Plans, and the Medicaid managed care plans.  Medicare is a federal program that provides health insurance benefits to individuals age 65 and older, some disabled individuals and individuals with end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is a federal and state funded program, administered at the state level, which provides health insurance benefits and subsidies to individuals who are unable to afford to pay for healthcare services or health insurance on their own. All of our hospitals are certified as providers under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  
 The payments we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than the standard charges at our hospitals for the healthcare services provided.  Furthermore, reimbursement payments under federally-funded healthcare programs are subject to across-the-board spending cuts to the federal budget imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011.  These sequestration cuts, as they are known, require reductions in reimbursement rates through federal fiscal year 2025.  The Affordable Care Act, as currently structured, also imposes significant reductions on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates.  The federal government evaluates reimbursement rates annually.  Legislation or regulation resulting from the repeal, replacement or amendment of the Affordable Care Act may result in further payment reductions in the Medicare or Medicaid programs that could negatively impact our business. Our ability to operate our hospitals and affiliated healthcare facilities successfully in the future may depend, in large part, on our ability to adapt to the ongoing regulatory changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  See “Item 1.  Business — U.S. Healthcare Industry” for statistical information on U.S. population trends.
 Medicare Reimbursement
 Under the Medicare program, we are paid for inpatient and outpatient healthcare services provided to qualifying Medicare beneficiaries at our hospitals and other healthcare facilities.  Medicare is funded by the federal government under a series of individual programs.  For example, the Part A program covers hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health and hospice care services and the Part B program covers physician services, preventive care, durable medical equipment, hospital outpatient services, laboratory tests, x-rays, mental health care and some home health and ambulance services.  Medicare Advantage Plans, which is the customary term for the Part C program, are administered by private third-party payors that contract with the Medicare program to provide Medicare Part A and Part B benefits to participants.  They include plans organized as health management organizations (“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”), private fee-for-service plans, special needs plans and Medicare medical savings account plans.  We are paid directly by the third-party payor that administers a Medicare Advantage Plan for the healthcare services we provide to patients enrolled in one of these plans.  The regulations governing reimbursement under the Medicare program also generally apply to Medicare Advantage Plans.
 Inpatient Medicare Reimbursement.  Reimbursement rates for inpatient acute care services provided to Medicare beneficiaries are generally determined based on a prospective payment system.  Under the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”), our hospitals are paid a predetermined amount based on the patient’s diagnosis. Specifically, each discharge is assigned to a medical severity diagnosis-related group (“MS-DRG”) based upon the patient’s course of medical treatment during the relevant inpatient stay. The base MS-DRG payment rate does not consider the actual costs incurred by an individual hospital in providing a particular inpatient service. Each MS-DRG is assigned a relative weight that reflects the average amount of resources, as determined on a national basis, that are needed to treat a patient with that particular diagnosis compared to the amount of hospital resources that are needed to treat the average Medicare inpatient stay.  The IPPS payment for each discharge is based on two national standardized base payment rates, one that covers hospital operating expenses and the other that covers hospital capital costs.  The base MS-DRG payment rate for operating expenses is adjusted by a wage index to reflect geographical differences in labor costs.  While a hospital generally does not receive additional reimbursement beyond the MS-DRG payment, hospitals may qualify for an “outlier” payment when a patient’s medical treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified regulatory threshold.
 CMS adjusts the MS-DRG payment rates annually, using the “market basket index” to account for changes to the costs of goods and services purchased by hospitals.  For federal fiscal year 2017, which began on October 1, 2016, CMS increased the reimbursement rate by 0.95% for hospitals that successfully report the quality measures of the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (“IQR”) Program and are meaningful EHR users.  This rate increase accounts for a projected market basket update of 2.7%, reduced by a multi-factor productivity adjustment of 0.3%, a 0.75% reduction required by the Affordable Care Act, and a negative 1.5% documentation and coding recoupment adjustment required by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. It also reflects a positive adjustment of approximately 0.8% to remove the effects of prior adjustments intended to offset the estimated increase in IPPS expenditures resulting from the Medicare program’s “two-midnight rule”. Under the “two-midnight rule,” services provided to Medicare patients are only payable as inpatient hospital services when there is a reasonable expectation that the hospital care is medically necessary and is 
 12

required across two midnights, absent unusual circumstances.  Hospital stays expected to need less than two midnights of hospital care are subject to medical review on an individual case basis. For federal fiscal year 2017, hospitals that do not successfully report quality data under the IQR Program will be subject to a 25% reduction of the market basket update.  Hospitals that are not meaningful EHR users are subject to an additional 75% reduction of the market basket update.
 The DRG payment rates are also adjusted pursuant to provisions of the Affordable Care Act that promote value-based purchasing, linking payments to quality and efficiency. For example, hospitals that meet or exceed defined quality performance standards receive greater reimbursement, while hospitals that do not satisfy the quality performance standards may receive reduced Medicare inpatient hospital payments. The amount collected from the reductions is pooled and used to fund the payments that reward hospitals based on a set of quality measures that have been linked to improved clinical processes of care and patient satisfaction. CMS scores each hospital on its achievement relative to other hospitals and improvement relative to that hospital’s own past performance. Similarly, hospitals that experience “excess readmissions” for conditions designated by CMS within 30 days of the patient’s date of discharge receive inpatient payments reduced by an amount determined by comparing that hospital’s readmission performance to a risk-adjusted national average. In addition, CMS incentivizes hospitals to improve Hospital Acquired Condition (“HAC”) rates by reducing total inpatient Medicare payments by 1% for hospitals that rank among the lowest-performing 25% with respect to HACs.  
 Outpatient Medicare Reimbursement. CMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients without Part A coverage) under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system (“OPPS”).  Other items and services, such as physical, occupational and speech therapies, durable medical equipment, and clinical diagnostic laboratory services, are reimbursed pursuant to fee schedules.
 Hospital outpatient services paid under the OPPS are grouped into ambulatory payment classifications (“APCs”).  Services for each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require.  CMS has established a payment rate for each APC, and it updates these rates annually on a calendar year basis.  For calendar year 2017, CMS issued a final rule that it estimates will result in a 1.7% payment increase for hospitals paid under the OPPS.  This reflects a market basket increase of 2.7%, a negative 0.3% multi-factor productivity adjustment and the 0.75% reduction required by the Affordable Care Act annually for calendar years 2017 through 2019.  Hospitals that fail to meet quality data reporting requirements are subject to a 2.0% reduction to the market basket update.
 CMS is implementing, as required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, a site-neutral Medicare reimbursement policy.  Effective as of January 1, 2017, this policy limits reimbursement under the OPPS for items and services that are provided at certain off-campus outpatient provider-based departments (“off-campus OPBDs”) of hospitals.  Items and services that are subject to the policy are reimbursed under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (“MPFS”).  For calendar year 2017, CMS has adopted a set of MPFS payment rates that are specific to off-campus OPBDs, which are set at approximately 50% of the OPPS rates.  However, the site-neutral payments do not apply to items and services rendered in a dedicated emergency department or at off-campus OPBDs that are located within 250 yards of a remote location of a hospital.  CMS will also continue to make OPPS payments for services performed by grandfathered, or “excepted,” off-campus OPBDs, which include those that were billing Medicare for outpatient hospital services prior to November 2, 2015.
 Medicare Bundled Payments.  The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation, which is part of CMS, works to identify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for healthcare services that create savings under the Medicaid and Medicaid programs, while maintaining or improving quality of care. Some of the current and proposed initiatives involve bundled payments, which link payments to participating providers for services provided during an episode of care. Generally, providers participating in a bundled payment arrangement agree to receive one payment for services provided to patients for certain medical conditions or during each episode of care. In contrast to the traditional fee-for-service model, bundled payments are intended to align incentives for providers, encouraging more effective and efficient care.
 As of April 2016, hospitals located in markets selected by CMS, are required to participate in the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (“CJR”) model, a mandatory bundled payment initiative focused on knee and hip replacements. Participating providers are evaluated against quality standards and Medicare spending targets established by CMS for each episode of care. An episode of care begins with a patient’s hospital admission and includes all related care by the hospital and other providers within 90 days of discharge. Depending on whether overall CMS spending per episode exceeds or falls below the target and whether quality standards are met, hospitals may receive supplemental Medicare payments or owe repayments. On January 3, 2017, CMS published a final rule implementing a new bundled payment model for cardiac care and expanding the existing CJR model for hip surgery care. Hospitals in markets selected by CMS will be accountable for the cost and quality of care provided to Medicare patients for a heart attack, bypass surgery, hip surgery or femur bone treatment. The final rule also includes a cardiac rehabilitation incentive payment program.   CMS may continue to introduce mandatory bundled payment initiatives.  We operate one hospital within the geographical areas currently being tested and could become subject to additional bundled payment initiatives if CMS expands such programs into more areas where we operate hospitals.
 Medicare-Dependent Hospital Program.  The Medicare program also makes reimbursement rate adjustments under a Medicare-Dependent Hospital program that applies to low admission volume hospitals, referred to as rural extenders, to ensure hospital access for rural Medicare beneficiaries.  The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) extended the Medicare-Dependent Hospital program through federal fiscal year 2017.  If future legislation is not passed to further extend the Medicare-
 13

Dependent Hospital program, we could experience a reduction in our net operating revenues at certain of our hospitals that currently qualify for participation in this program.
 Medicare Physician Services Payments.  Physician services provided to Medicare patients are reimbursed based on the MPFS, which is adjusted annually.  Under MACRA, the MPFS reimbursement rate will increase 0.5% each calendar year through 2019. MACRA also established the Quality Payment Program (“QPP”), a payment methodology intended to reward high-quality patient care. Beginning in 2017, physicians and certain other healthcare clinicians are required to participate in the QPP through one of two tracks. Under both tracks, performance data collected in 2017 will affect Medicare payments in 2019. CMS expects to transition increasing financial risk to providers as the QPP evolves. The Advanced Alternative Payment Model (“APM”) track makes incentive payments available for participation in specific innovative payment models approved by CMS, such as certain ACO models or a Medicare Shared Savings Program. Providers may earn a 5% Medicare incentive payment between 2019 and 2024 and will be exempt from reporting requirements and payment adjustments imposed under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”) if the provider has sufficient participation (based on percentage of payments or patients) in an Advanced APM. Alternatively, providers may participate in the MIPS track. Providers who choose the MIPS track initially will be subject to a performance-based reimbursement rate increase or decrease of up to 4% of the provider’s Medicare payments based on their performance with respect to clinical quality, resource use, clinical improvement activities and meaningful use of EHR. The adjustment percentage will increase incrementally, up to 9%, by 2022. MIPS will consolidate components of three existing incentive programs: the Physician Quality Reporting System, the Physician Value-Based Payment Modifier, and the Medicare EHR Incentive Program.
 Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments.  In addition to making payments related to specific patient services, Medicare provides financial support to hospitals that treat a disproportionately large number of low-income patients.  These Disproportionate Share Hospital (“DSH”) payments are determined annually based on statistical information required by the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and are paid as a percentage addition to MS-DRG payments.   Medicare DSH payments are being reduced to 25% of the amount they otherwise would have been prior to the enactment of the Affordable Care Act.  The 75% reduction in DSH payments are earmarked for an uncompensated care payment pool that is further reduced each year by a formula that reflects reductions in the U.S. uninsured population that is under 65 years of age. Thus, the greater the rate of coverage for the previously uninsured population, the more the Medicare uncompensated care pool will be reduced. Each eligible hospital is then paid, out of the uncompensated care pool, an amount based upon its estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.  The IPPS final rules for federal fiscal years 2017 and 2016 established the uncompensated care amounts to be distributed to qualifying hospitals in these years as nearly $6.0 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively.
 Medicare Administrative Contractors.  CMS competitively bids the Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”) in 12 defined jurisdictions. Each MAC is geographically assigned and serves both Medicare Part A and Part B providers within its given jurisdiction. As a result of consolidation efforts, CMS gave chain providers the option of having all hospitals use one home office MAC. Although we elected to use one MAC, CMS has not yet transitioned all of our hospitals to one MAC and has not provided a clear timeline for doing so. MAC transitions impact Medicare claims processing, which could delay reimbursement payments and adversely affect our cash flow. MAC transitions may also be prompted by the periodic re-soliciting by CMS of MAC bids in a jurisdiction.
Medicaid Reimbursement
 Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states to provide healthcare benefits to certain low-income individuals. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a prospective payment system or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. Amounts received under the Medicaid programs are often significantly less than the hospital’s standard charges for the services provided.  State Medicaid agencies may also fund Medicaid Managed Care Plans, which are administered by managed care organizations (“MCOs”). The MCOs receive a set per member per month payment for their administrative services from the applicable state Medicaid agency.  We are paid directly by the MCO for the healthcare services we provide to patients enrolled in one of these plans. The regulations that govern the reimbursement rates of the Medicaid programs also generally apply to Medicaid managed care plans. Budget pressures have prompted many states to consider reducing Medicaid funding, as Medicaid is often the state’s largest program. Some states have adopted or are considering legislation intended to reduce coverage, increase enrollment in managed care programs or otherwise finance the system. However, the Affordable Care Act, as enacted, requires that states maintain certain eligibility standards until October 1, 2019. The Affordable Care Act also prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical services provided to patients to treat HACs. We can provide no assurance that reductions to Medicaid funding will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.  
 The Affordable Care Act required states to expand Medicaid coverage by adjusting eligibility requirements such as income thresholds. A number of states have opted out of the Medicaid expansion provisions, which they may do without losing federal funding. Some states that have opted out of the Medicaid coverage expansion are evaluating other options such as waiver plans to operate an alternative Medicaid expansion program. The 2016 federal elections, which resulted in the election of a Republican president and Republican majorities in both houses of Congress, increased the likelihood of significant changes to the Affordable Care Act, including its Medicaid expansion provisions. This has created significant uncertainty with regard to the future of the Medicaid programs, particularly in states that opted to expand coverage pursuant to the Affordable Care Act. Nine of the 16 states in which we 
 14

operate hospitals have expanded coverage under their state Medicaid programs.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, our hospitals and affiliated outpatient service facilities located in these nine states generated 70.4% of our total net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts.
 Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital and Supplemental Payments.  Currently, 15 states in which we operate hospitals utilize supplemental payment programs, including disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) programs, for the purpose of providing additional payments for services to providers, such as our hospitals, to offset a portion of the cost of providing care to Medicaid and indigent patients. These programs are designed with input from CMS and funded with a combination of federal and state resources, including, in certain states, taxes, fees or other program costs (collectively, “provider taxes”) levied on the providers participating in the programs.  Hospitals that provide care to a disproportionately high number of low-income patients may receive Medicaid DSH payments.  The federal government distributes federal Medicaid DSH funds to each state based on a statutory formula. States then distribute the DSH funding among qualifying hospitals, as determined in each state.  States have broad discretion to define which hospitals qualify for Medicaid DSH payments and the amount of such payments.  Under the most recent updates to the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid DSH funding will be reduced annually by an additional $1 billion each year in comparison to the prior year beginning with a $2 billion reduction in federal fiscal year 2018 and ending with an $8 billion reduction in federal fiscal year 2025.  In addition to DSH payments, some states operate programs that provide for supplemental payments to bridge the gap between hospital operating costs and Medicare reimbursement. Various federal policy changes are focused on limiting the use of other types of supplemental payments.
 We recognize the reimbursement payments due to us from state supplemental payment programs in the periods amounts are estimable and revenue collection is reasonably assured.  These amounts are recorded in operating revenues as favorable contractual allowances and the costs we incur under these programs are recorded as other operating expenses.
 The following table shows the portion of our Medicaid reimbursements attributable to state supplemental payment programs (in thousands):
  
 | Year Ended December 31, | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+--------
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | | 2014
Medicaid revenues | $ | 220,389 | | $ | 211,696 | | $ | 192,771
Provider taxes and other expenses | | 76,616 | | | 75,929 | | | 73,149 
Reimbursements attributable to state supplemental payment programs, net of expenses | $ | 143,773 | | $ | 135,767 | | $ | 119,622

 Several states in which we operate face budgetary challenges that have resulted, and likely will continue to result, in reduced Medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers.  Continuing pressure on state budgets and other factors could result in future reductions to Medicaid payments, payment delays or additional provider taxes being assessed on hospitals participating in these programs.
 The California Department of Health Care Services implemented the Hospital Quality Assurance Fee (“HQAF”) program, imposing a fee on certain general and acute care California hospitals.  Revenues generated from these fees provide funding for the non-federal supplemental payments to California hospitals that serve California’s Medicaid (“Medi-Cal”) and uninsured patients.  Under the most recent phase of the program, covering the period January 2014 through December 2016, we recognized $34.4 million, $31.5 million and $25.2 million of operating revenues, net of provider taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 In November 2016, California voters approved a state constitutional amendment measure that extends indefinitely the statute that imposes fees on California hospitals seeking federal matching funds.  However, the current program expired on December 31, 2016 and CMS has not approved a new program. Consistent with the first four phases of the HQAF Program, we will not recognize any revenues under the new program until CMS completes the approval process.  HQAF funding levels are based in part on Medi-Cal utilization.  As a result, changes in coverage of individuals under the Medi-Cal program could affect the revenues and cash flows of our California hospitals under future phases of the HQAF Program.  We are currently estimating the 2017 to 2019 HQAF Program will be approved in the fourth quarter of 2017 and that our revenues will be approximately $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, all of which will be recorded in the fourth quarter.  We cannot provide any assurances of the amount of revenues our hospitals may receive from or the timing of CMS’ approval of the 2017 to 2019 HQAF Program, the timing of the related cash flows, or that the program will be approved at all.
 Electronic Health Records Incentive Payments
 Pursuant to the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), we are eligible to receive incentive payments under the Medicare and Medicaid programs related to our hospitals and physician clinics that demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology. If we fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology, we are subject to payment reductions. For acute care hospitals that failed to demonstrate meaningful use in 2015, the IPPS market basket increase will be reduced by 75% in 2017. Each of our hospitals and physician clinics has completed the initial adoption phase of EHR 
 15

implementation and is currently in the process of implementing the remaining two phases.  EHR incentive payments are subject to audit and potential recoupment if it is determined that the applicable meaningful use standards were not met and are also subject to retrospective adjustment because the cost report data upon which the incentive payments are based are further subject to audit.
 Although we believe that our hospitals are currently in compliance with the meaningful use standards, there can be no assurance that all of our hospitals will remain in compliance and therefore not be subject to the HITECH penalty provisions.  We incur both capital expenditures and operating expenses in connection with the implementation of EHR technology initiatives. The amount and timing of these expenditures does not directly correlate with the timing of the receipt of EHR payments or the recognition of EHR incentives as earned.  We record EHR incentives in our statements of income as a reduction to our operating costs and expenses.  As we move toward the full implementation of certified EHR technology in accordance with all three phases of the program, our EHR incentives will decline and ultimately end.  For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our EHR incentives earned were $11.5 million, $25.8 million and $44.7 million, respectively.  We anticipate that we will earn approximately $5 million of EHR incentives in 2017.
 TRICARE
 TRICARE is the U.S. Department of Defense’s healthcare program for members of the armed forces. Under the TRICARE program, hospitals and other healthcare providers are reimbursed for healthcare services provided to qualifying patients using an inpatient DRG-based payment system and an outpatient prospective payment system similar to those used to make reimbursement payments under the Medicare program.
 Reimbursement under Non-Governmental Plans and Programs
 Managed Care and Commercial Plans 
 In addition to governmental healthcare reimbursement programs, we are paid for a portion of the healthcare services we provide to patients by private third-party payors, including commercial health insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs, other managed care companies, workers’ compensation carriers and employers. Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between the standard charges for our services and the contracted payment amounts that we receive from non-government third-party payors, but are responsible for the portions of the payment for services that are not covered by programs or plans under contract. These amounts generally consist of the deductibles and co-payment obligations of their coverage. The deductible and co-payment obligations due from patients, which we include in the self-pay payor category, have increased in recent years in response to the rising costs of healthcare services.  
 Commercial health insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care companies generally attempt to manage their costs by seeking discounted fee structures or fixed fee charge arrangements with providers to reduce their payouts below the provider’s standard charges or the charges initially billed to them.  They also utilize other strategies, such as narrowing the provider options in their networks, to restrict the pool of providers that insured patients may utilize under their coverage. To remain competitive, we actively engage in the negotiation of discounts or fixed fee charge arrangements with commercial health insurance and other private managed care companies. The negotiated discounts and fixed fee charge arrangements are typically less than the reductions in reimbursement rates imposed on us by governmental payors.  If an increasing number of private third-party payors succeed in negotiating discounted or fixed fee structures with us or if we are unable to negotiate acceptable contractual terms with these payors and therefore do not participate in some or all of the commercial health insurance and managed care networks in our markets, our results of operations or cash flows may be adversely impacted. There can be no assurance that we will retain our existing reimbursement payment arrangements with private third-party payors with whom we currently do business or that these third-party payors will not attempt to further reduce the reimbursement payments they ultimately pay to us for our services in the future.
 Commercial health insurance companies that participate on the Exchanges, which were established pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, are required to offer a set of minimum coverage benefits and a minimum number of levels of plans that vary depending on the percentage of total premium costs to be paid by the insured individual. Our hospitals participate in the provider networks of various insurers offering plan options on the Exchanges. However, the number of insurers participating in the Exchanges decreased significantly for the 2017 plan year. In many cases, these private third-party payors are opting out of the Exchanges due to the rising costs of participation.
 Accountable Care Organizations
 With the aim of reducing healthcare costs by improving quality and operational efficiency, ACOs are gaining traction in both the public and private sectors of the U.S. healthcare industry. An ACO is a network of providers, including hospitals, physicians and other designated healthcare-related professionals, which work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficiency in the delivery of healthcare services. ACOs are intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency initiatives. Pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, HHS established a Medicare Shared Savings Program that seeks to promote accountability through the creation of ACOs. Medicare-approved ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. HHS has 
 16

significant discretion in determining key elements of ACO programs. Certain waivers are available from fraud and abuse laws for ACOs.  We do not currently participate in any public or private-sector ACOs.
 Affordable Care Act
 Over the last decade, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have passed a large number of laws and regulations intended to result in major changes to the U.S. healthcare system. The most prominent of these reform efforts, the Affordable Care Act was designed to, among other things, increase access to affordable health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens, reduce government program spending, improve patient quality of care and impose more stringent enforcement against providers for false claims and other misconduct.
 It is difficult to predict the full impact of the Affordable Care Act due to a number of factors, including clarifications and modifications resulting from executive orders, the rule-making process, the outcome of court challenges, the development of agency guidance, unknowns related to state Medicaid program expansion and the level of participation in the health insurance exchange system, and budgetary issues at federal and state levels. Further, the future of the Affordable Care Act is uncertain following the 2016 federal elections. The newly elected president and certain members of Congress have stated their intent to repeal or significantly modify the Affordable Care Act but have not yet agreed upon replacement reforms. The impact of repeal or changes to the Affordable Care Act and any newly enacted reforms on the healthcare industry is difficult to assess.   
 As part of these initiatives, the Affordable Care Act, as currently structured, mandates that substantially all U.S. citizens maintain health insurance coverage, while expanding access to health insurance coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms. Changes to the Medicaid program expanded the categories of individuals that qualify for coverage. Provisions focused on the private sector prohibit health insurance companies from imposing annual coverage limits and excluding individuals based on pre-existing conditions. In addition, the Affordable Care Act and require that large employers offer health insurance coverage to full-time employees to avoid tax penalties. Some provisions of the Affordable Care Act have increased our operating costs and made changes to these programs that could adversely impact the reimbursement we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These changes include reductions to the Medicare annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019, a productivity offset to the Medicare market basket update, and reductions to disproportionate share hospital payments. 
 Other Government Laws and Regulations
 Licensure, Certifications and Accreditations
 Hospitals and other healthcare providers are subject to laws and regulations regarding licensing, certification or accreditation, and may be subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local governmental agencies evaluating compliance and performance with such requirements.  In addition, healthcare providers participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to extensive regulatory requirements in order to continue to qualify for participation in these programs. 
 Regulations imposed on healthcare facilities for licensure, certification and accreditation address compliance areas such as the following:
  
• | the adequacy of medical care, equipment and staff;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | operating policies and procedures;
--+-----------------------------------


• | billing and coding for services, including classifying the acuity level of care provided;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proper handling of reimbursement overpayments;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | preparing and filing of Medicare and Medicaid annual cost reports;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | relationships between referral sources and recipients;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | maintaining adequate compliance records;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | utilization reviews of services provided at our facilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | standard charges for patient services;
--+---------------------------------------


• | compliance with building codes;
--+--------------------------------


• | environmental protection; and
--+------------------------------


• | patient privacy and security.
--+------------------------------

 Failure to comply with applicable licensure, certification, and accreditation standards may result in criminal penalties, civil sanctions, loss of operating licenses, or restrictions on our ability to participate in certain government programs.  All of our hospitals 
 17

and other healthcare facilities are currently licensed under appropriate state laws and are qualified to participate in both federal and state Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 Fraud and Abuse Provisions
 Federal and state governments have enacted various laws intended to prevent and reduce healthcare fraud and abuse, which continue to be a top enforcement priority. Violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties, including exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Civil monetary penalties increased significantly in 2016, as required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, were further adjusted in 2017, and will be updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.
Federal False Claims Act
 The federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) prohibits knowingly making false claims or statements to the U.S. government, including submitting false claims for reimbursement under government programs. The FCA broadly defines the term “knowingly”. Although simple negligence does not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity may constitute “knowingly” submitting a false claim and result in liability. The FCA can be used to prosecute fraud involving issues such as coding errors, billing for services not provided, and submitting false cost reports. Its reach extends to payments involving federal funds in connection with the Exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act. Violations of other statutes, such as the Stark Law, can serve as a basis for liability under the FCA.
 Among the potential bases for liability under the FCA are knowingly and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and knowingly failing to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding annual cost report is due, whichever is later.  Overpayments are deemed to have been “identified” when a provider has, or should have, through reasonable diligence determined that a reimbursement overpayment was received and quantified such overpayment.
 A provider that is determined to be liable under the FCA is required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the federal government, plus a mandatory civil penalty ranging from $10,957 to $21,916 for each separate false claim, after accounting for 2017 updates.  These penalties will be updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.  Settlements entered into prior to litigation usually involve a less severe calculation of damages. The FCA also contains “qui tam” or whistleblower provisions, which allow private individuals to file a complaint or otherwise report actions alleging the defrauding of the federal government by a provider.  If the federal government intervenes, the individual that filed the initial complaint may share in any settlement or judgment. If the federal government does not intervene in the action, the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue its allegation independently and may receive a larger share of any settlement or judgment.  When a private individual brings a qui tam action under the FCA, the defendant generally is not be made aware of the lawsuit until the federal government commences its own investigation or determines whether it will intervene.
 Any provider that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid reimbursement payments is required to distribute and make available to all employees, contractors and any other agents detailed information about its policies related to false claims, false statements and whistleblower protection under certain federal laws, including the FCA, and similar state laws.
 Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
 The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“Anti-Kickback Statute”), a subsection of the Social Security Act, makes it a felony to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit, or receive remuneration, directly or indirectly, in  order to induce patient referrals or business that is reimbursable under any federal  healthcare  program.  Violations under the Anti-Kickback Statute may result in exclusion from federal healthcare programs and the imposing of criminal and civil fines, including the payment of damages up to three times the total dollar amount involved. The civil monetary penalties have been and will continue to be updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. Further, submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false claim under the FCA.
 The HHS Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) is responsible for identifying and investigating fraud and abuse activities in federal healthcare programs.  As part of its duties, the OIG provides guidance to healthcare providers by identifying types of activities that could violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. The OIG has published regulations that set forth “safe harbors” protecting certain payment and business practices, outlining activities and business relationships that are deemed not to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute.  The failure of a particular activity to comply with the safe harbor regulations does not necessarily mean that the activity violates the Anti-Kickback Statute; however, such failure may lead to increased scrutiny by the OIG or other governmental enforcement agencies.
 The OIG has identified the following incentive arrangements as potential violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute:
  
• | payment of any incentive by a hospital to a physician when the physician makes a patient referral to the hospital or to a healthcare facility that benefits the hospital;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provision of free or significantly discounted office space or equipment to physicians to entice them to locate in close proximity to the hospital;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provision of free or significantly discounted billing, nursing or other medical and administrative staffing services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 18


 
• | provision of free training for a physician or a physician’s medical and office staff, including management and laboratory training, but excluding compliance training;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provision of guarantees that provide that if a physician’s income falls below a predetermined level, the hospital will pay the remainder to them;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provision of low-interest or interest-free loans, or loans that may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to the hospital;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of the costs of a physician’s travel and expenses for conferences;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment for services to a physician, in which such services require few, if any, substantive duties to be performed by the physician or that are in excess of the fair market value of the services rendered;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | coverage of a physician on the hospital’s group health insurance plan at an inappropriately low cost to the physician;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | purchases from a physician made by a hospital for goods and services at prices in excess of their fair market value;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | rental of space in physician offices at prices below fair market value; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | engaging in relationships with physician-owned entities, often referred to as physician-owned distributorships (“PODs”), which derive revenues from the sale or arrangement for sale of implantable medical devices whereby the physician orders such medical devices and then uses them for their own patients in surgeries or procedures performed at the hospital or other outpatient service facility.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have a variety of financial arrangements with physicians who refer patients to our hospitals. Physicians own interests in some of our facilities. Physicians may also own our stock. We have contracts with physicians providing for a variety of financial arrangements, including employment contracts, leases, management agreements and professional service agreements. We provide financial incentives to recruit physicians to relocate to communities served by our hospitals. These incentives include relocation packages, reimbursement for certain direct expenses, income guarantees and, in some cases, loans.  Although we strive to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, taking into account available guidance from the OIG including the “safe harbor” regulations, we cannot make assurances that the OIG or other regulatory agencies may not determine that our actions are in violation.  If that happens, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties or may become excluded eligibility to participate in the Medicare, Medicaid, or other government healthcare programs.
 The Stark Law
 The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law”. This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to healthcare entity in which they or any of their immediate family members have ownership interests or other financial arrangements if the entity provides certain “designated health services”. These types of referrals are commonly known as “self-referrals”. The Stark Law also prohibits entities that provide designated health services reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid from billing these programs for any items or services that result from a prohibited referral and requires the entities to refund amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to the prohibited referral. “Designated health services” include inpatient and outpatient hospital services.
 Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of reimbursement payments under federal healthcare programs, civil monetary penalties of up to $24,253 per claim submitted, after taking into account 2017 updates, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, the Stark Law provides for a penalty of up to $161,692 for engaging in activities intended to circumvent the Stark Law prohibitions. These penalties will be updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.
 There are ownership and compensation arrangement exceptions to the self-referral prohibitions under the Stark Law. For example, one exception allows a physician to refer patients to a healthcare entity in which the physician has an ownership interest if such entity is located in a rural area, as defined under the Stark Law. There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and healthcare entities, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements. From time to time, the federal government has issued regulations that interpret the provisions included in the Stark Law.
 Another Stark Law exception, known as the “whole hospital” exception, allows a physician to make a referral to a hospital if the physician owns an interest in the entire hospital, as opposed to an ownership interest in a department of the hospital. A hospital is considered to be physician-owned if any physician, or an immediate family member of a physician, holds stock, debt or other types of investment arrangements in the hospital or in any owner of the hospital, excluding physician ownership through publicly traded securities that meet certain conditions. CMS regulations impose various restrictions and disclosure requirements on physician-owned hospitals. Physician-owned hospitals must disclose their physician ownership in writing to patients and must make a list of their physician owners available upon request to the public. Each physician owner who is a member of a physician-owned hospital’s medical staff must agree, as a condition of their inclusion on the medical staff and their admitting privileges at the hospital, to disclose in writing to all patients whom they refer to the hospital their ownership interest, or an immediate family members’ ownership interest, in the hospital. Failure to comply with the physician-ownership regulations may result in the hospital’s loss of eligibility to participate in the Medicare program.
 19

The Affordable Care Act narrowed the “whole hospital” exception to the Stark Law.  Although existing physician investments in a whole hospital may continue under a “grandfather” clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, physicians are prohibited, from the time the Affordable Care Act became effective, from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital. In addition, the Affordable Care Act restricts the ability of existing physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their aggregate licensed beds, operating rooms and procedure rooms. 
 Other Fraud and Abuse Laws
 Under various federal laws and regulations, any individual or entity that knowingly and willfully defrauds or attempts to defraud a healthcare benefit program, including both governmental and private healthcare programs and plans, may be subject to fines, imprisonment or both. The Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMP Law”) imposes substantial civil penalties on providers that, for example, knowingly present or cause to be presented a claim for services not provided as claimed, offer remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary’s selection of a healthcare provider, or bill Medicare amounts that are substantially in excess of a provider’s usual charges. Notably, the CMP Law requires a lower burden of proof than some other fraud and abuse laws. Criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for a number of other prohibited activities, including engaging in certain gainsharing arrangements or contracting with an individual or entity known to be excluded from a federal healthcare program. 
 Federal enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from federal healthcare programs any investors, officers, and managing employees associated with business entities that have committed healthcare fraud, even if those individuals had no knowledge of the fraud.
 State Laws
 A number of states, including states in which we operate hospitals, have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private individual or entity may file a civil lawsuit in a state court. Federal laws provide an incentive to states to enact false claims laws at the state level that are comparable to the FCA.
 In addition, many states in which we operate have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals. Many states have also passed self-referral legislation similar to the Stark Law, prohibiting the referral of patients to entities with which the physician has a financial relationship. Often these state laws are broad in scope and may apply regardless of the source of payor for the healthcare services provided. These statutes at the state level typically include criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of licensure, for violations.  There is little precedent for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws.
 Program Integrity
 CMS contracts with third parties to promote the integrity of the Medicare program through review of quality concerns and detection efforts to identify improper reimbursement payments. Most non-governmental managed care programs require similar utilization reviews.  Quality Improvement Organizations (“QIOs”), for example, are groups of physicians and other healthcare quality experts that work on behalf of CMS to ensure that Medicare pays only for the delivery of healthcare goods and services to Medicare beneficiaries that are considered reasonable and necessary courses of treatment and that are provided in the most appropriate setting. Among other responsibilities, QIOs are tasked with conducting short stay inpatient hospital reviews to evaluate compliance with the two midnight rule. Providers that exhibit persistent noncompliance with Medicare payment policies may be referred by a QIO to a Recovery Audit Contractor.
 Under the Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) program, CMS contracts with third parties nationwide to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the Medicare program, as required by statute. RACs review claims submitted to Medicare for billing compliance, including correct coding and medical necessity. Compensation for RACs is on a contingency basis, based upon the amount of overpayments and underpayments identified, if any. CMS recently reduced the number of claims that RACs may audit by limiting the number of records that RACs may request from hospitals based on each provider’s claim denial rate for the previous year.
 The RAC program’s scope also includes Medicaid claims. States may coordinate with Medicaid RACs regarding recoupment of overpayments and refer suspected fraud and abuse to appropriate law enforcement agencies. Under the Medicaid Integrity Program, CMS employs private contractors, referred to as Medicaid Integrity Contractors (“MICs”) to perform reviews and post-payment audits of Medicaid claims to identify potential overpayments. MICs are assigned to five geographic jurisdictions within the United States. Besides MICs, other approved contractors and state Medicaid agencies have increased their review activities of Medicaid payments.
 We maintain policies and procedures to respond to RAC requests and payment denials. Payment recoveries resulting from RAC reviews and denials are appealable, and we pursue reversal of adverse determinations at appropriate appeal levels. Depending upon the growth of RAC programs and our success in appealing claims, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Currently, there are significant delays in the assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law Judges. According to the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals, the average processing time in fiscal year 2016 was nearly two and a half years. In June 2016, HHS proposed changes to the Medicare appeals process intended to streamline the process and improve efficiency, but also stressed the need for additional funding.
 20

Annual Cost Reports
 Hospitals participating in the Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs are required to meet specified financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require submission of annual cost reports identifying medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients.
 Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and some Medicaid programs are subject to routine governmental audits. These audits may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. Finalization of these audits often takes several years. Providers can appeal any final determination made in connection with an audit. MS-DRG outlier payments have been and continue to be a subject of CMS audit and adjustment. The OIG is also actively engaged in audits and investigations into alleged abuses of the MS-DRG outlier payment system.  For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded net favorable (unfavorable) contractual allowance adjustments in net operating revenues of $(5.8) million, $(15.1) million and $9.2 million, respectively, related to previous program reimbursement estimates and final cost report settlements.  The 2015 and 2014 amounts were impacted by an $11.1 million Illinois cost report settlement which was recorded as a favorable adjustment in 2014 and an unfavorable adjustment in 2015 upon its reversal in the second quarter due to contract negotiations that were finalized in that quarter.
 HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) Administrative Simplification provisions and their implementing regulations require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards and code sets for certain healthcare claims and reimbursement payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the U.S. healthcare industry.   HHS is in the process of adopting standards for additional electronic transactions and establishing operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction. Health plans and healthcare providers covered by HIPAA, including our hospitals, were required to implement updated standard code sets, known as the “ICD-10” coding system, by October 1, 2015.
 HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and implementing regulations extensively regulate the use, disclosure, confidentiality, availability and integrity of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information,” and provide for a number of individual rights with respect to such information. These requirements apply to health plans and most health care providers, which are known as “covered entities”. Vendors, known as “business associates,” that handle protected health information, on behalf of covered entities must also comply with most HIPAA requirements. A covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. In order to comply with HIPAA, covered entities must, among other things, maintain privacy and security policies, train workforce members, maintain physical, administrative, and technical safeguards, enter into confidentiality agreements with business associates, and permit individuals to access and amend their protected health information.  In addition, covered entities must report breaches of unsecured (unencrypted) protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, but not to exceed 60 calendar days from the discovery date of the breach. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain cases involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to report on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. All non-permitted uses or disclosures are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate can demonstrate that there is a low probability that the information has been compromised.  
 HIPAA violations may result in criminal penalties and a range of civil penalties of up to $55,910 per violation with a maximum civil penalty of $1,677,299 for violations of the same requirement in the same calendar year, after taking into account 2017 updates. These civil penalties are subject to annual updates to reflect changes to the consumer price index. State attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages up to $25,000 for violations of the same requirement in a calendar year in response to HIPAA violations that affect their state residents. HHS has the discretion in many cases to resolve HIPAA violations through informal means without the imposition of penalties.  However, HHS is required to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect and can and has imposed significant penalties. HHS also conducts compliance audits, which could lead to further compliance reviews or to enforcement actions. 
 Our healthcare facilities continue to remain subject to other applicable federal or state laws that are more restrictive than the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, which could result in additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions against entities whose inadequate data security programs may expose consumers to fraud, identity theft and privacy intrusions, including the security programs of entities subject to HIPAA regulation. Various state laws and regulations require entities that maintain individually identifiable information (even if not health-related) to report data breaches to affected individuals and, in some cases, state regulators. In connection with our corporate compliance program, we have implemented a comprehensive set of privacy and security policies and procedures. We expect compliance with HIPAA and other privacy and security standards to continue to impose significant costs on our hospitals and operations.
State Certificate of Need Laws
 In some states where we operate hospitals and outpatient service facilities, the construction or expansion of healthcare facilities, the acquisition of healthcare facilities, the transfer or change of ownership related to healthcare facilities and the addition of new 
 21

licensed beds or healthcare service lines at healthcare facilities may be subject to review, prior approval or notification with a state regulatory agency under a certificate of need (“CON”) program.  Such laws are generally in place for the reviewing state regulatory agency to determine the public need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities and services in a specific market.  As of December 31, 2016, we operated 26 hospitals in 10 states that have adopted CON programs.  See “Item 2.  Properties” for a table that denotes the states where we operate hospitals in which CON programs are present.  The failure to provide required notification and obtain necessary approval in states having a CON program can result in the inability to expand, acquire or change ownership related to healthcare facilities in a particular market.  Violations of these state laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of a hospital’s licenses.
 Not-for-Profit Hospital Conversion Legislation
 Many states, including some where we have hospitals and others where we may in the future acquire hospitals, have adopted legislation regarding the sale or other disposition of hospitals operated by not-for-profit entities. In other states that do not have specific legislation, the attorneys general have demonstrated an interest in these transactions under their general obligations to protect charitable assets from waste. These legislative and administrative efforts primarily focus on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds from the sale by the not-for-profit seller. These reviews and, in some instances, approval processes can add additional time to the closing of a hospital acquisition. There can be no assurance that future actions at a state level will not seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire not-for-profit hospitals. If these activities are widespread, they could limit our ability to acquire hospitals in general.
 Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting
 Some states have adopted laws that prohibit unlicensed individuals or business entities from employing physicians. Some states also have adopted laws that prohibit unlicensed individuals or business entities from making direct or indirect payments to physicians or that prohibit these parties from engaging in fee-splitting arrangements.  Physicians that violate these laws are subject to sanctions, including loss of licensure, civil and criminal penalties and rescission of business arrangements. Laws, such as these, vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or state regulatory agencies. We structure our arrangements with employed physicians to comply with the state laws where we operate. We can give no assurance that governmental agencies responsible for enforcing these laws will not assert that we are in violation of these laws. These laws could also be interpreted by the courts in a manner inconsistent with our interpretations.  See “—Employees and Medical Staff — Physicians” below for additional information on our employed physicians.
 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
 All of our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”). This federal law requires any hospital that participates in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every individual that enters the hospital’s emergency department seeking treatment and, if the patient is suffering from an emergency medical condition, including active labor, requires the hospital to either stabilize the patient’s condition or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to another healthcare facility that can handle the condition. The obligation of the hospital to examine and stabilize emergency medical conditions or otherwise make an appropriate transfer of the patient to another suitable healthcare facility exists regardless of a patient’s ability to pay for treatment.  Outpatient service facilities that lack emergency departments or otherwise do not treat emergency medical conditions are not generally subject to EMTALA; however, they are required to have policies and procedures that address the handling of situations in which an individual presents at their facility seeking emergency medical treatment, such as transferring the patient to the closest hospital with an emergency department. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient’s ability to pay, including exclusion from participation in the Medicare program and civil monetary penalties. These penalties increased significantly in 2016, were further adjusted in 2017, and will be updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. In addition to these penalties, a harmed patient, the patient’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another participating hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil lawsuit against that other hospital.
Medical Malpractice Tort Law Reform
 Laws related to medical malpractice liability have historically been maintained at the state level. All states have laws governing medical malpractice liability lawsuits. Almost all states have eliminated joint and several liability in medical malpractice lawsuits and many states have established caps on the damage awards or attorney fees permissible in such lawsuits.  Recently, many states have introduced legislation to address medical malpractice tort reform. Proposed solutions include enacting limits on non-economic damages, malpractice insurance reform and gathering lawsuit claims data from malpractice insurance companies and the courts for the purpose of assessing the connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates. Medical malpractice reform legislation has also been proposed, but not adopted, at the federal level that could preempt additional state legislation in this area.
 22

Environmental Regulation
 Our hospitals and outpatient service facilities are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, including medical and pharmaceutical waste products.  Our compliance costs related to environmental laws are not significant and we do not anticipate that these costs will become material to us in the future.
Supply Contracts
 We purchase medical supplies, equipment, pharmaceuticals and certain other items under an agreement with a group purchasing organization (“GPO”) that covers all of our hospitals and their affiliated outpatient service facilities.  By participating in a group purchasing organization, we believe that we can procure items at more competitively priced rates than we would pay for similar items without such agreement.  In addition, we provide a service opportunity to our QHR hospital clients to contract with us for purchases that we make on their behalf under the terms of our agreement with this group purchasing organization.
 Agreements with CHS Related to the Spin-off
 In connection with the Spin-off and effective as of the Spin-off date, we entered into certain agreements with CHS that at the time of Spin-off governed the allocation to us of various assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including investments, property, employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) that were previously part of CHS.  In addition, these agreements govern certain relationships and activities between us and CHS for a definitive period of time after the Spin-off date, as specified by each individual agreement.
 A summary of these agreements follows:
  
• | Separation and Distribution Agreement. This agreement governed the principal actions of both QHC and CHS that needed to be taken to effect the Spin-off. It sets forth other agreements that govern certain aspects of our relationship with CHS following the Spin-off.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to the agreements referenced above, we entered into certain transition services agreements and other ancillary agreements with CHS defining agreed upon services, as specified by each agreement, to be provided by CHS to us commencing on the Spin-off date.  The agreements generally have terms of five years.
 A summary of the major transition services agreements follows:

• | Computer and Data Processing Transition Services Agreement. This agreement defines services to be provided by CHS for information technology infrastructure, support and maintenance. Services include, but are not limited to, operational support for various applications, oversight, maintenance and information technology support services, such as helpdesk, product support, network monitoring, data center operations, service ticket management and vendor relations. Fees are based on both a fixed charge for labor costs, as well as direct charges for all third-party vendor contracts entered into by CHS on QHC’s behalf.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Receivables Collection Agreement (“PASI”). This agreement defines services to be provided by CHS’ wholly-owned subsidiary, PASI, which currently serves as a third-party collection agency to us related to accounts receivable collections of both active and bad debt accounts of QHC hospitals, including both receivables that existed as of the Spin-off date and those that have occurred during the operating period since the Spin-off date. Services include, but are not limited to, self-pay collections, insurance follow-up, collection letters and calls, payment arrangements, payment posting, dispute resolution and credit balance research. Fees are based on the type of service and are calculated based on a percentage of recoveries.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For the year ended December 31, 2016, the total expenses we incurred related to the transition services agreements since the Spin-off date was $44.7 million and the allocations from CHS to us for these same services prior to the Spin-off date were $21.7 million, or on a combined basis the total expenses in 2016 were $66.4 million.  For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the allocated costs from CHS for these services were $60.2 million and $40.5 million, respectively.
 Compliance Program
 We recognize that our compliance with laws and regulations impacting our business depends on individual employee actions as well as company-wide operations.  We adopted a compliance program following the Spin-off for our entire business (the “Compliance Program”).  Our Compliance Program focuses on aligning compliance responsibilities with operational functions and is intended to reinforce our company-wide commitment to operate strictly in accordance with the laws and regulations that govern our business.  Our hospital and corporate office management teams manage and oversee compliance among the employees within our hospitals and outpatient services facilities, QHR and all other departments within our company.
 Our Compliance Program contains the following requirements, among others:
  
• | oversight of management at all levels;
--+---------------------------------------


• | a written code of conduct (the “Code of Conduct”);
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | policies and procedures that address specific risk areas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | employee education and training programs;
--+------------------------------------------


• | an internal system available to employees and affiliates to report concerns;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | auditing and monitoring programs; and
--+--------------------------------------


• | policies related to the enforcement of the Compliance Program.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to the above, our Compliance Program includes policies and procedures related to the interpretation and implementation of the HIPAA standards for privacy and security.  It also includes procedures specific to claims preparation and submission, including procedures for coding, billing and annual cost reports.  It addresses policies related to financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources, compliance with the FCA, the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law.  The program includes policies specific to our compliance with EMTALA related to the treatment of hospital emergency room patients regardless of their ability to pay.  We plan to continuously review our Compliance Program and to make necessary updates or changes to be compliant with new laws and regulations or industry standards impacting our business.
 Our written Code of Conduct applies to all persons and businesses associated with our company, including directors, officers, employees and consultants.  We have a confidential disclosure program to enhance the statement of ethical responsibility expected of our employees and all business associates with whom we work, including our accounting, financial reporting and asset management departments. Our Code of Conduct is posted on our website at www.quorumhealth.com.
 Corporate Integrity Agreement
 On August 4, 2014, CHS became subject to the terms of a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the OIG arising from a civil settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, other federal agencies and identified relators that concluded previously announced investigations and litigation related to short stay admissions through emergency departments at certain of their affiliated hospitals.  The OIG has required us to be bound by the terms of the CHS CIA commencing on the Spin-off date and applying to us for the remainder of the five-year compliance term required of CHS, which terminates on August 4, 2019.
 The compliance measures and the reporting and auditing requirements contained in the CIA include:
  
• | continuing the duties and activities of the Corporate Compliance Officer, Corporate Compliance Work Group, and Facility Compliance Officers and committees;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
24

 
• | maintaining a written Code of Conduct, which sets forth our commitment to full compliance with all statutes, regulations, and guidelines applicable to federal healthcare programs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintaining written policies and procedures addressing matters included in our Compliance Program, including adherence to medical necessity and admissions standards for inpatient hospital stays;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continuing general compliance training;
--+----------------------------------------


• | providing specific training for employees and affiliates handling our billing, case management and clinical documentation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | engaging an independent third party to perform an annual review of our compliance with the CIA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continuing the Confidential Disclosure Program and hotline to enable employees or others to disclose issues or questions regarding possible inappropriate policies or behavior;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continuing the screening program to ensure that we do not hire or engage employees or contractors who are ineligible persons for federal healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reporting any material deficiency which resulted in an overpayment to us by a federal healthcare program; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submitting annual reports to the OIG which describe in detail the operations of the corporate Compliance Program.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A material, uncorrected violation of the CIA could lead to our suspension or disbarment from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. In addition, we are subject to possible civil penalties if we fail to substantially comply with the terms of the CIA, including stipulated penalties ranging from $1,000 to $2,500 per day.  We are also subject to a stipulated penalty of $50,000 for each false certification by us or any individual or entity on behalf of us in connection with reports required under the CIA.  The CIA increases the amount of information we are required to provide to the federal government regarding our healthcare practices and our compliance with federal regulations.  We believe that we are currently operating our business in compliance with the CIA and are unaware of any historical actions on our part that could represent a violation under the terms of the CIA.
 Insurance Reserves
 Professional and General Liability and Workers’ Compensation
 As part of the business of owning and operating hospitals, we are subject to legal actions alleging liability on our part. To mitigate a portion of this risk, we maintain insurance exceeding self-insured retention levels for these types of claims.  Our self-insurance reserves reflect the current estimate of all outstanding losses, including incurred but not reported losses, based upon actuarial calculations as of period end. The loss estimates included in the actuarial calculations may change in the future based upon updated facts and circumstances.  Our insurance expense includes actuarially determined estimates of losses for the current year, including claims incurred but not reported, the change in the estimate of losses for prior years based upon actual claims development experience as compared to prior actuarial projections, the insurance premiums for losses in excess of our self-insured retention levels, the administrative costs of the insurance programs, and interest expense related to the discounted portion of the liability. Our reserves for professional and general liability claims and workers’ compensation claims are based upon actuarial calculations updated semi-annually.  These calculations are discounted to present value and consider historical claims data, demographic considerations, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.  Our reserves are discounted based on our risk-free interest rate that corresponds to the period when the self-insured claims are incurred and projected to be paid.
 Prior to the Spin-off, CHS provided professional and general liability insurance and workers’ compensation insurance to QHC and indemnified us from losses under these insurance arrangements related to our hospital operations business. The liabilities for claims related to our hospital operations business were determined based on an actuarial study of our operations and historical claims experience at our hospitals. Corresponding receivables from CHS were established to reflect the indemnification by CHS for each of these liabilities for claims that related to events and circumstances that occurred prior to the Spin-off date.  For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had total liabilities of $116.0 million and $127.4 million related to insurance for professional and general liabilities and workers’ compensation liability, respectively, of which $98.1 million and $122.4 million, respectively, were the indemnified portions for which we have offsetting receivables from CHS.
 Under our current insurance arrangements, our self-insured retention level for professional and general liability claims is $5 million per claim.  Additionally, we maintain a $0.5 million per claim, high deductible program for workers’ compensation.  We maintain a separate insurance arrangement for professional and general liability related to QHR, due to the differing nature of this business.  The self-insured retention level for QHR is $6 million for professional and general liability insurance.
 Employee Health Benefits
 We are self-insured for substantially all of the medical benefits of our employees.  We maintain a liability for our current estimate of incurred but not reported employee health claims based on historical claims data provided by third-party administrators.  The 
 25

undiscounted reserve for self-insured employee health benefits was $11.0 million as of December 31, 2016.  Expense each period is based on the actual claims received during the period plus any adjustment to the liability. 
 There can be no assurance that our future cash flows will be adequate to cover the self-insured portion of professional and general liability, workers’ compensation and medical claims in the future.  If we are required to make payments for claims that exceed the estimated losses we have reserved, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted in the future.
 Employees and Medical Staff
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 14,100 employees, including approximately 3,900 part-time employees. We are subject to various federal and state laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating to employment. We maintain a number of different employee benefit plans.
Physicians
 Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and physicians who are not employees of our hospitals.  Our ability to generate revenues from our hospital operations business is impacted by the number, quality and specialty area of practice of physicians providing healthcare services at our facilities, and additionally the scheduling and admitting of patients by these physicians.  As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 344 employed physicians at our hospitals and affiliated outpatient service facilities.  Some physicians provide services in our healthcare facilities pursuant to a contract with us.  These contracts generally describe the types of healthcare services that the physician is contracted to perform, establishes the duties and obligations of the physician, requires certain performance criteria be met by the physician and fixes the compensation arrangements for the services performed by the physician. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospital’s medical staff and the board of directors of the hospital, in accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve the physician’s acceptance to the medical staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals that we do not own and may terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time. It is essential to our hospital operations business that we attract an appropriate number of quality physicians in the specialty care service areas required to support our hospital operations business and that we maintain good relationships with our physicians.  In some of our markets, physician recruitment and retention are affected by a shortage of physicians in certain desired specialty care service areas and are affected by the difficulty that physicians can experience in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance.
Unions and Labor Relations
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 2,400 employees, including approximately 1,600 part-time employees, at our nine hospitals represented by labor unions.  We consider our employee relations to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages that had a material adverse impact on our business or results of operations.
