ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
Zenosense, Inc. was incorporated on August 11, 2008 in the State of Nevada. Our authorized common stock currently consists of 500,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, with par value of $0.001.
 
In December 2013, we filed an amendment to our charter to change our name from "Braeden Valley Mines, Inc." to "Zenosense, Inc." As a result of the change of our corporate name to Zenosense, Inc., the trading symbol of the company changed to "ZENO."
 
The Company was originally incorporated to acquire and to develop mineral properties with gold and related mineralizations.  On May 15, 2013, our then mining lease expired, and we ceased that business.  We then became a shell company, as defined under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, until December 4, 2013, when we entered into the transaction with Sgenia described below.
 
In the summer of 2013, we became interested in sensory technology devices for use in hospitals and health care environments and negotiated a license agreement with the developers of the technology (the "Sgenia Technology"). In December 2013, we entered into a Development and Exclusive License Agreement (the "License Agreement") with Sgenia Industrial, S.L. ("Sgenia") and its subsidiaries Sgenia Soluciones, S.L. ("Sgenia Subsidiary") and ZENON Biosystem, S.L. ("Zenon"), all of which are formed under the laws of Spain. During 2014 to early 2016 product development of the Sgenia Technology was undertaken for a device to be used for the detection of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus/Staphylococcus aureus ("MRSA/SA") in the healthcare environment and another device for use to detect lung cancer in patients. We provided Zenon with capital for the development of these devices (the "Sgenia Products"), in exchange for a worldwide, exclusive license to manufacture, market and sell the resulting products, subject to certain limitations and a royalty arrangement on a revenue sharing basis. The License Agreement gives us additional rights to improvements and developments to the Sgenia Products and future products using the Sgenia Technology. In 2016 the Sgenia parties did not achieve milestones set forth in the License Agreement, and the Company ceased funding any further development of the Sgenia Technology. Currently, we cannot estimate if and when those milestones will be met.  The License Agreement is still in force, and although no action is being pursued thereunder, if in the future the Sgenia parties are able to re-commence development of the Sgenia Products and the Sgenia Technology, then we will evaluate our involvement with Sgenia.
 
In May 2016, expanded our operations to participate with a third party in the development of what we consider to be a novel Point of Care medical diagnostic device targeting cardiac markers. The object is to develop a device for the rapid diagnosis of heart attack and cardiac related illnesses. On June 20, 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture arrangement, under the name MIDS Medical Ltd ("MML"), a UK Limited company, by way of a Subscription and Shareholders' Agreement ("MML SSA") with a third party medical diagnostic device technology developer ("Partner"). The Company owns a 40% interest, awarded on July 1, 2016, in exchange for its participation and funding obligation of an aggregate amount of $650,000 ("MIDS Funding"), to support MML during a Phase 1 and prospectively during a Phase 2 development of the Partner's MIDS universal immunoassay detection technology platform ("MIDS"). MML will have the right, under license, to use the MIDS Intellectual Property ("MIDS IP") during the development, and the MIDS IP will be transferred to MML in the event MML concludes a commercial deal for MIDS with a third party. The SSA was modified in September and December 2016 and January 2017 to amend the amount and timings of our funding payments to reflect the cash requirements of MML.
 
Currently, our principal operations are the management of our obligations under the MML SSA, including the product review, budget determination and capital funding of the development of the MML. We also monitor our rights and obligations under the License Agreement with Sgenia, and we believe that the Sgenia parties are not pursuing any development activities thereunder.

Business
 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, we actively supported the development of what we believe to be a novel Point of Care ("POC") medical diagnostic business of our joint venture, MML. The core focus is the development of a medical diagnostic device targeting cardiac markers to prospectively deliver a high sensitivity troponin assay for the rapid diagnosis of heart attack and cardiac related illnesses.  The trend toward greater POC testing is driven by the faster diagnostic benefits it provides.  Other reasons have also emerged for the high demand of POC testing, including clinical staff shortages, an ageing population, long-term healthcare cost savings and a decrease in reliance on conventional laboratory services.

MML SSA
 
We entered into the MML SSA with the Partner, effective June 20, 2016, under which we acquired a 40% interest in the joint venture in exchange for management participation and providing funding to support MML during a Phase 1 and prospectively during a Phase 2 development of the Partner's MIDS universal immunoassay detection technology. MML will have the right, under license, to use the MIDS Intellectual Property ("MIDS IP") during the development and the MIDS IP will be transferred to MML in the event MML concludes a commercial deal for MIDS with a third party. At no time prior to a sale will the Company's ownership interest in MML be an equity interest of less than 30%. As a condition of the SSA, MML has a Supply of Services Agreement under which it receives the services of a key person related to the MIDS development. The MML SSA was amended September 28, 2016, December 6, 2016 and January 31, 2017. The amendments primarily reflected changes in the timings of our funding the development budget and a change to the original plan to allow MML to explore a potential enhancement to the MIDS nanoparticle detection method and the exploration of the potential development of a "Magnetic Bridge" detection technique based on the MIDS technology. On January 19, 2017, MML submitted a patent application for this new detection method: "Device and method for accurate measurement of magnetic particles in assay apparatus ".
 
The Company also has additional control rights over MML including representation on the board of directors, rights over the appointment and employment of senior management persons, indebtedness, major transactions, budget approval rights, accounting practices and general operational management supervisory rights. The SSA also provides for a Phase 1 contingency funding (the "Contingency") to be available after March 31, 2017 in an aggregate amount of up to £45,000 (approximately $64,000 as of the date of this report) to be paid by the Company within 20 days of receiving a written notice from MML.
 
The SSA contains various provisions to govern the funding obligations of the Company: if no Contingency is drawn during Phase 1 the Partner will be awarded an enduring 2.5% profit after tax right in MML ("Override") which will increase to a 15% Override if the Company declines to fund Stage 2; if the Company declines to fund Phase 2 and any Contingency has been drawn, the Partner will be awarded a 15% Override decreased by 0.5% for each £7,500 tranche of Contingency drawn down during Phase 1. Any Override will convert on a ratio of 1% Override to 1% of ordinary shares in the event of a sale of MML.
 
The Company's funding obligation for product development under Phase 1 is subject to an approved budget under the SSA, as amended.  Through December 31, 2017, the Company provided the MIDS Funding in full, and it has a potential future current obligation to fund the Contingency. The budget may be modified, but only after agreement between us and our Partner. A Phase 2 development is envisaged and subject to the successful conclusion of Phase 1; in this event the Company and the Partner will formulate a new budget at which point MML may independently elect to obtain alternative funding for Phase 2 at MML's option.
 
The MML SSA is governed by English law, and the venue for actions based on the SSA will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.
 
Background of MML
 
MML has licensed in (from the Partner) a Point of Care (POC), universal immunoassay reader platform ("MIDS") that intends to deliver gold standard laboratory analyzer levels of precision and sensitivity in a hand held device. The MIDS platform will initially be developed to read high sensitivity assays for the main cardiac biomarker troponin I (cTnI, and troponin T, cTnT), a critical marker for myocardial infarction ("MI", "Heart Attack"). A further aim is to create a system capable of testing a panel of up to three cardiac biomarkers from the same sample.
 
MML has a small technical team of employees and contractors with deep expertise and knowledge in the application of nano-magnetic sensing and electronics into immunoassay POC testing.
 

· | Dr. Nasser Djennati, who leads the team, is a UMIST graduate with extensive experience in instrumentation design, analogue and digital electronics, IT, sensor design and specifically in nano magnetic detection applications within the medical POC device area. He has 20 years expertise in Hall Effect technology and magnetic field measurement and experience in the regulatory approvals process for Class II- a medical device products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
MML's team is supported by subcontracting companies expert in the fields of nano-magnetic sensor design and production, microfluidics and assay development.
 
MML's board of directors includes Dr. Nasser Djennati, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Carlos Gil, and the Partner's Chief Executive Officer, Tom Barr.
 
MML's offices and laboratory are located at the UK Government supported Sci-Tech Daresbury campus in the UK. Sci-Tech Daresbury is internationally recognized for leading-edge scientific research and commercial development.

 
We believe our initial market may be the United Kingdom.

Myocardial Infarction and Cardiac Markers
 
As an example of the impact that the MIDS product might have in what might be our first market, we discuss aspects of the United Kingdom market.
 
There are over 175,000 heart attacks in the UK each year, equating to one every three minutes1. This means that each day, approximately 480 people will go to hospital after suffering a heart attack - equivalent to one person every three minutes2.
 

· | The number of heart attack survivors has doubled in the last 40 years as research and healthcare continues to improve.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A 2012 NHS report showed the mortality rate in England during 2002-10 fell by 50% in men and 53% in women3.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Time is of the essence when someone has had or is having a heart attack. Immediate action is critical to limit damage and optimize a better recovery for the patient4. Health care professionals refer to this time frame as the "Golden Hour"5, which described the critical one hour from the onset of a heart attack. Most deaths occur during this period if not treated properly6.
 
Clinical guidelines on chest pain of recent onset recommend taking a blood sample for troponin I or T measurement on initial assessment in hospital as the preferred biochemical markers to diagnose acute MI7 . The guideline further recommends a second troponin measurement to be taken 10 to 12 hours after the onset of symptoms8 .
 
This guidance offers the following guidelines for assessment in hospital for people with suspected ACS;
 

· | Take a resting 12-lead ECG and a blood sample for troponin I or T measurement on arrival in hospital
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Carry out a physical examination
--+---------------------------------


· | Take a detailed clinical history unless ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction is confirmed from the resting 12-lead ECG
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
However, the diagnostic sensitivity of an ECG has been reported as only 55 – 75% for acute myocardial infarction 9.
 
Cardiovascular diseases represent more than 30% of all deaths globally, which is larger than the combined deaths of other diseases such as cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases and digestive diseases10.
 
Cardiac markers are biomarkers measured to evaluate heart function. They are used in the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome11.
 

· | A troponin test measures the levels troponin T or troponin I proteins in the blood12. These proteins are released when the heart muscle has been damaged, such as occurs with a heart attack13.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The more damage there is to the heart, the greater the amount of troponin there will be in the blood.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Troponins are preferred over traditional markers, such as CK-MB or myoglobin, due to their greater specificity and sensitivity14.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Death from cardiovascular diseases can be preventable with accurate early-stage diagnosis and subsequent proper treatment15.

Troponin tests
 
Due to their increased sensitivity and specificity compared with CK-MB and other conventional biomarkers, troponins have been the preferred choice for the diagnosis of heart attacks16. The financial pressure on the NHS of patients occupying beds and requiring monitoring during a traditional 12–24 hour troponin test window is clear17.
 
Large cost savings can be made by reducing amount of time a patient would normally spend in A&E waiting for the results of a laboratory troponin test.
 
If MIDS Medical's rapid POC test was introduced, we believe many patients could avoid undergoing further tests, and beds could be cleared faster. We believe that an estimated £200 million a year could be saved by the NHS18, notwithstanding that a MIDS POC troponin test would command a substantial premium in price over a standard laboratory troponin test.
 
Proposed MML Product Development
 
MML's immunoassay diagnostic platform is being developed into a novel POC cardiac device, MIDS Cardiac, which aims to detect extremely low levels (nano-Tesla) of magnetic field disturbance caused by assay test particles. This is expected to enable high sensitivity assays, previously only available on central laboratory analyzers, in a POC setting, on a small, hand-held device. The system is being developed to be fully automated from the point of application of a small finger-stick blood sample to a test strip - encompassing sample collection, pre-treatment, analyte specific reaction, signal production, signal reaction and final result.
 
The technology will incorporate microfluidic strip design, displacement flow immunoassay, magnetic nanoparticle manipulation and a detection technique comprised of bespoke 'Hall Effect' sensors which will maximise, as far as possible, the sensitivity and accuracy of the result. The platform's microfluidic strip will include a sample deposition area, where antibody coated magnetic nanoparticles will be bonded onto the surface. These nanoparticles will only be dislodged if a biomarker is present within the patient's sample. Upon displacement, the fluid containing the nanoparticles and biomarker will move downstream along the strip's adapted channels towards collection/sensing areas. These areas are located within an external bias magnetic field, which enables the Hall Effect sensors to detect any magnetic field disturbances caused by the nanoparticles. The level of displacement, and hence the biomarker's presence, may also be semi-quantified using an optical sensor at the sample deposition surface by taking a reading before and after the progression of the assay.
 
MIDS Cardiac will initially be developed using the main cardiac biomarker troponin I (cTnI), a critical marker for myocardial infarction. The aim is to create a system capable of testing a range of cardiac biomarkers from the same sample.
 
The MIDS technology aims to deliver certain key USPs as follows:
 

· | Improve the accuracy of immunoassay biomarker detection to provide quantitative measurements of samples, effectively combining the accuracy of high sensitivity cardiac biomarker assays performed on central laboratory ("CL") analyzers with the speed and convenience of a POC, hand held device;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Rapid analytical time; 3 minutes for a single assay test, much faster than existing, less sensitive POC tests19 and very much faster than CL analyzer tests;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Accuracy and sensitivity will permit the use, for the first time, of rapid HS cTnI tests able to rule / in rule out MI, at the POC;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ability to use just a 5 ul (a small drop) of finger-stick blood for a single assay test on an easy to use microfluidic test strip, no other POC cTnI device can do this as they require venous draw20;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ability to multiplex up to three assays on a single test strip using a <15ul finger stick blood sample in under 8 minutes; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Very simple operation by relatively untrained operative - can be used very easily at first contact with patient delivering fully automated results with no requirement for expert interpretation by a highly skilled operative.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Market need (UK example)
 
Emergency department
 
Patients presenting symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) represent a sizable proportion of total attendees in the emergency department21.
 

· | In the UK, around 700,000 patients attend hospital emergency departments each year with chest pains22.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The current standard policy for dealing with patients admitted in these circumstances is to take a troponin measurement on admission and then again 12 hours afterwards to rule out acute myocardial infarction23.
 

· | A typical district general hospital will see around 6,500 patients present with chest pain of suspected cardiac origin each year24.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NHS Glasgow had reported a lower number of 3,000 patients every year who come to the hospital as an emergency with chest pain25 .

Approximately 70% of patients who are admitted to A&E with suspicion of ACS are later ruled out after further investigation26. Conversely, a significant number of patients with ACS are mistakenly discharged home from the emergency department, resulting in avoidable patient mortality 27.
 

· | Approximately 2 to 4% of patients with an ACS are mistakenly discharged28.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Around 14,000 and 50,000 patients a year are wrongly sent home by doctors having suffered a mild heart attack that has been missed by current testing methods29.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Subsequently, medical litigation arising from missed diagnosis is increasing at the rate of 20%30.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A way of rapidly and accurately assessing risk status in suspected patients with ACS would benefit efficiency of the emergency department, patient care, and outcomes31
 
Many of the existing practices, including current POC technologies available, lack the required sensitivity and accuracy to provide fully quantitative measurements; a pre requisite now demanded by healthcare professionals of future POC devices. Many use lateral flow systems that limit the ability of the technology to quantify and detect biomarkers requiring multiple reagents.
 
Cardiac Biomarker Market
 
The global market for in vitro diagnostic tests (both lab based and POC) for cardiac biomarkers was estimated at $3.1 billion in 2012 and nearly $4 billion in 2013. This market is predicted to reach $7.2 billion by 2018, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.8% over the five-year period from 2013 to 201832. The main growth drivers will be new congestive heart failure (CHF) biomarkers, approvals of stroke biomarkers, the growing market in point-of-care testing and the rising awareness of medical care in China and other developing countries33.
 
The cardiac marker market is expected to be the fastest growing point of care market segment through to 201834.
 
The U.S. has the largest share of the cardiac biomarker market, estimated at roughly $2.0 billion in 2013 with a CAGR of 9.6% forecast from 2013–2018, which will help the U.S. maintain its leading position in the market35.
 
In 2013, the European market was valued at about $800 million barely beating out China as the second-largest market behind the U.S.

 
Our Company is in the development stage
 
During the second half of 2016 and early 2017, initial development commenced on the MIDS project, including the specification of a bench rig designed to support first stage testing of a sample of Hall Effect Sensors already supplied to MML in order to examine their behaviour in the detection of magnetic nanoparticles – the core MIDS technology – and to determine how these Hall Effect Sensors should be optimized prior to integration in a micro fluidic test strip.
 
Initial testing of 15.2 nm magnetite nanoparticles in 5 mg/ml aqueous solution showed excellent linearity of average system output signal against sample drop volume and high levels of output signal, even at sample volumes down to 15 nanolitre size.
 In the second quarter of 2017, MML commenced the next stage of the Phase 1 development, developing a "Hybrid Strip" consisting of a first iteration simulation of the MML "MIDS" Lab-on-Chip ("LoC") test strip system, an assembled unit that replicates, as closely as possible, a fully integrated LoC system. The Hybrid Strip is designed to prove the principle of LoC nano-magnetic detection of high sensitivity assay sized quantities of paramagnetic nanoparticles and used to gather data from low doses of nanoparticles & microbeads. Subsequently, initial testing was conducted on both the assembled Hybrid unit and its electronic and microfluidic components, focusing mainly on the electronics of the magnetic sensing system by presenting reducing amounts of a variety of commercially available assay beads and nanoparticles to the Hall sensing electronics by a micropipette dosed carrier. MML tested seven assay bead samples from four leading manufacturers, generally in the size range of 0.5µm to 5 µm. These were mainly composite beads selected for their uniformity and handling characteristics, but having less than ideal magnetic values, to challenge the detection system. In addition one sample of coated magnetite beads with more easily detected, higher magnetic values, was also tested. Ultimately, a bead type with the ideal combination of assay suitability and magnetic value will be selected for an assay to be embodied on the MIDS LoC test strip.
 The following results were obtained by MML:
   
· | All the beads could be magnetically detected in very low quantities, including samples of beads that were previously undetectable in the last round of testing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In a number of instances the current Limit of Detection of fairly standard beads appears to be already at or near to the range advised by assay consultants as prospectively suitable for a high sensitivity troponin assay, subject to the design of the assay.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Crucially, all the beads displayed an excellent and reliable Log2 linear response (the signal doubling with a doubled quantity of beads), which is key to accurate quantitation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


These results were obtained by presenting measured volume of sample beads in their carrier fluid directly to the Hall sensor circuit which limits sensitivity compared to the envisaged LoC set up.

Successful microfluidic flow testing of the Hybrid strip was also conducted. Commercial composite beads were magnetically captured after passing through a hydrophilic channel to collect in the very small detection area, exactly as planned. This testing has also revealed a fluid signal effect on top of the magnetic detection signal, which is expected to be routinely addressed in the next iteration of the Hybrid strip, currently being designed as part of the on-going R&D process.
 Work is on-going for a redesign of the Hybrid Strip and to carry out more quantitative testing. This work includes further substantive changes to the bench reader electronics, informed by the testing to date. These changes are designed to further improve the sensitivity and stability of the system prior to accommodate a second iteration of the microfluidic strip.
 Subject to suitable quantitative results in the microfluidic context MML expects to work closely with its assay consultants throughout a Phase 2 development which, subject to a final development plan being agreed between the Company and MML, will aim to embody an assay on a microfluidic LoC strip.
 Under our arrangement with MML, either MML or our Partner currently is responsible for determining the commercialization strategy. Therefore they will be the primary party responsible for the strategy to satisfy any regulatory approval process, other aspects of licensing, manufacturing or other production and marketing. The Company will have a secondary management and oversight role in the aspects of commercialization. The Company and MML's intention is to licence or partner the MIDS platform with a global major diagnostics company subject to proving up a LoC assay.
 
Sgenia License Agreement
 
Although we have ceased active funding of the License Agreement with the Sgenia parties at this time, the License Agreement continues to be an enforceable agreement between the parties.  If and when Zenon and its affiliates are able to demonstrate the milestones in the License Agreement, the parties will assess their respective capabilities to continue the development and funding obligations of the License Agreement and conclude any modified arrangements as necessary.
 
We entered into the License Agreement, effective December 4, 2013, which was subsequently amended, with the objective of developing a MRSA/SA detection device.  Because the License Agreement covered improvements and variations to the device and other devices based on the Sgenia Technology for use in the hospital and health care environments, the License Agreement was amended and specifically extended to include an additional product to be used for the detection of lung cancer in patients.  In exchange for our funding the development of the Sgenia Products, we obtained a worldwide, exclusive license to manufacture, market and sell the resulting products, subject to certain limitations and a royalty arrangement on a revenue sharing basis.
 
Under the License Agreement, as amended, based on our capital resources and the success of the research activities, we are obligated to fund the development of the Sgenia Products pursuant to a research and development plan proposed by Sgenia. Development includes the testing of a potential device.  All intellectual property developed by Sgenia and/or Zenon at any time during the term related to the manufacturing, formulating and/or packaging processes shall be shared ownership and licensed to us on a royalty-free basis.  Sgenia will supply us, at a negotiated price based on quantity, all of the requirements for the integrated circuits on microchips that are necessary for the operation of the Sgenia Products, once developed.  Sgenia, Zenon and the Company are obligated to work together to research and develop the Sgenia Products and establish written plans and reviewing committees for the management of the overall development project and commercialization of the Sgenia Products.
 
From the date of the License Agreement through December 31, 2017, the Company provided funding for the Sgenia Products of approximately $769,787, and as of that date it has a potential future current obligation to fund approximately €656,000 euros. Our funding obligation is to be based on a budget developed after collaboration and approval with us, as we agree in our sole discretion. As the Sgenia Products and any future products are determined, the Company will formulate a new budget obligations and funding requirements.  Because the Sgenia Product development has not met certain milestones, we are not providing any funding currently.
 
The License Agreement has Sgenia and Zenon as responsible for regulatory filings in jurisdictions selected by the Company, subject to the collaborative process and any regulatory approvals are jointly owned by the parties to the License Agreement. The expenses of meeting the regulatory requirements will be borne by the Company, subject to its right to approve the regulatory budget, which is separate from the development funding budget.
 
In addition to providing the development and regulatory funding, the Company will also pay Zenon royalties for completed sales of the Sgenia Products, payable 60 days after each fiscal quarter of the Company (the "Royalties").  The Royalties will be 20% of net sales, which is calculated based on gross sales of the device and the installation and training for the Sgenia Products, less various expenses, including manufacturing, components acquired from Sgenia, commissions, refunds and discounts and sales taxes.  If the Sgenia Products are sold by Sgenia or Zenon in Spain for original use in Spain, then the Royalties will be reduced. The Company also has the right to sublicense to other parties throughout the world, except in Spain if and when, if at all, Sgenia or Zenon seek to act as the distributor in that territory.
 
Sgenia and Zenon have granted the Company the first right to negotiate for a license to any improvements and variations of the Sgenia Products that are not currently included in the license or other commercial uses of the sensory technology that is based on the Sgenia patents for use in relation to hospital acquired infections, which currently are not licensed under the License Agreement, and for products developed for any other commercial uses for the sensory technology based on the patents held by Sgenia Soluciones and its affiliates.
 
The License Agreement may be terminated by either party if a party commits a material breach that is not cured in 90 days after the non-breaching party provides a notice of the breach.  Upon the termination of the License Agreement for any reason other than the Company's failure to cure a material breach, the Company has the right to dispose of any of the Sgenia Products then on hand, and to complete orders for Sgenia Products then on order.
 
All the parties have agreed to various collaboration obligations to assure and maintain the quality of the Sgenia Products, to oversee manufacturing, marketing and pricing and achieving marketing objectives. The obligations extend to the budgeting and expense of development of the Sgenia Products.

 
Sgenia will be the exclusive supplier of the integrated circuits for the Sgenia Products, which it will be responsible for manufacturing and imprinting with the necessary circuitry.

The Sgenia Products, once manufactured and distributed, may only be sold under the limited warranties of having been manufactured in accordance with specifications, practices and procedures established by the parties, to be free of material defects and free from contamination and to be manufactured and labeled in accordance with applicable health laws and regulations.
 
Sgenia is responsible for prosecuting, maintaining and protecting its patents and patent applications on which the Sgenia Products are based.  The Company may request Sgenia to take action to stop competitive infringement of the Sgenia Products, and take over the responsibility for such action if Sgenia does not act, and retain any award achieved by Company action.
 
The License Agreement is governed by New York law, and the venue for actions based on the License Agreement is to be in New York.
 
Background of Sgenia
 
Sgenia and its subsidiaries are known for its sensor development and is a supplier of sensors related to the control of the Tokamak device used in a nuclear fusion research project. The Tokamak is one of several types of magnetic confinement devices, and is one of the most-researched candidates for producing controlled thermonuclear fusion power. Sgenia is a developer and supplier of the sensors, as well as the sensor technology, applied to the control system. Sgenia has also produced an algal contamination detector for use in water supply applications. The algal sensor scans for the volatile organic compounds ("VOCs") emitted by the target algae. The VOCs form a unique "chemical signature" which may be detected to rapidly and effectively determine the presence or absence of the algae. The Sgenia detector is effectively an electronic "nose" that can "smell" this signature. This algae sensor system underwent a successful eighteen month trial and is under contract with a Madrid area water supplier in Spain. It is likely to be rolled out as a networked solution across the water company's operations.
Proposed Zenosense MRSA/SA Product
 
The MRSA/SA device is based on the sensor platform developed by Sgenia, but requires modifications so that it can use a single low cost sensor to sample the air and continuously monitor for the airborne the VOC signatures emitted by MRSA/SA. The MRSA/SA VOC signatures are emitted when the bacteria has infected and expressed itself as a disease in the patient. If developed fully, we believe that MRSA/SA can be detected prior to the patient being obviously symptomatic, enabling an earlier intervention to contain and control its effect and spread. The device is intended to work by utilizing a single standard sensor to continuously scan for the MRSA/SA signature spectrum of the VOC. In the proposed Sgenia developed MRSA/SA device a single sensor will perform the entire VOC spectrum scan, as Sgenia's adaptive processing software enables it to perform an effectively infinite number of scans, creating tens of thousands of "virtual sensors" from a single sensor. The proposed product is being designed to eliminate the need for 8 to 32 sensors (as in competitor devices) with all the supporting processors, circuit boards and power supply, where each sensor is pre-set to detect a certain part of the MRSA/SA spectrum of VOCs.
 
A patent application was made on the January 17, 2013, under the reference P201330048 with the title (translated from Spanish) "Method of Analysis of a gas and artificial nose". The patent application description refers to: a method that allows the use of a single sensor to act as an unlimited number of sensors: a method of analysis of a gas through an artificial bio-inspired "nose" of general application that uses strategies for adaptive modulation of the sensor's parameters to fit the detection purpose of the nose. This enables an artificial nose of smaller dimensions than one with multiple sensors resulting in good portability, a wide range of applicability and reduced production costs.
 
At this time it is early to formulate a conclusion about the device.

 
Proposed Zenosense Cancer Detection Product
 
As a result of the work performed by Zenon for the MRSA/SA product and based on the Sgenia Technology, a potential additional product was been developed intended for use in detecting lung cancer in patients. The lung cancer detection device incorporates components designed to filter out the VOCs that must be excluded for optimized detection of target VOC biomarkers found in exhaled breath and associated with the incidence of lung cancer. These components and their elements include molecular sieves incorporated in complementary layered and mixed sensor structures to screen incoming VOCs, and a nanometric sensing mesh to maximize the detective area. Zenon has developed new metal oxide materials and combinations of metal oxides, a complementary quartz crystal sensor employing a gas sorbent substrate and a micro gas chromatography chip for pre-detection screening. All components are of a relatively low cost consistent with the Company's intent to create cost effective products.  Development of this device was undertaken during 2015, but the device was not entered into trials. Subsequently, because milestones were not met, the Company ceased funding research and development.
Possible Revenue Lines
 
The Company currently does not generate any revenue.  The potential for any revenue is dependent on the development of the MML and, if development is recommenced, the Sgenia Products, for which no assurance can be given. If the development of the MML and Sgenia Products is successful, the Company believes that its principal sources of revenues will be from sales of the various devices and service fees from the training of personnel in their use. There is no assurance that any marketable product will be developed, approved by regulatory authorities, manufactured or successfully distributed and sold.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to generate any revenues in the future.  The Company will need substantial funding for all the phases of its business plan before it is able to generate any revenues.  The Company has no identified sources of capital for all aspects of its financial needs under the current business plan.

 The Company will also consider licensing arrangements for any of the products and intellectual property that it has rights to.  In the latter case, since the intellectual property is shared with its development partners, these arrangements will require the consent of those parties. No assurance can be given that there could be licensing and royalty revenues.
 
MML Manufacturing
 
The MML technology is in development, the design of which having taken place in mind for manufacturing, but with no manufacturing planned as yet. In addition, MML will rely on the supply of a bespoke nano-magnetic sensor from a particular chosen manufacturer. If required, there is no assurance a suitable alternative supplier can be found, as there are a limited number of suppliers in this field.
 
Regulation
 
The Company expects that any of its devices (the "Products") will be subject to differing levels of regulation in each of their intended markets. Regulation will be oriented towards the efficacy of the Products for their intended purpose, in the healthcare environment and safety. Currently, the first market being contemplated for the Products is outside of the United States, which if successful will then be followed by the United States as an additional market.

FDA Regulation
 
Unless an exemption applies, we believe that each medical device that we plan to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require prior pre-market notification and 510(k) clearance from the FDA.  Although we cannot determine with certainty at this time because the Products are still in the development stage, we believe that they will be categorized as either a Class I or Class II device.
 
The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices being placed in Class I or II require fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk. Class I devices are subject to general controls such as labeling, pre-market notification, and adherence to the FDA's Quality System Regulation (a set of current good manufacturing practice requirements put forth by the FDA, which governs the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of finished devices) ("QSR"). Class II devices are subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidelines, as well as general controls. Some Class I and Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the premarket notification, or 510(k), clearance requirement or the requirement of compliance with certain provisions of the QSR. Devices will be placed in Class III and will require approval of a PMA application (i) if insufficient information exists to determine that the application of general controls or special controls of the device are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, or (ii) if they are life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or (iii)  if the FDA deems these devices to be "not substantially equivalent" either to a previously 510(k) cleared device or to a "pre-amendment" Class III device in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which PMA applications have not been required.
 
Clinical trials are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance. These trials generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE") to the FDA. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as laboratory testing results, and a testing protocol that is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. The FDA's approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward, but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product's safety and effectiveness, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.

 
Any clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA's IDE regulations that govern investigational device labling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators.
 
The withdrawal of previously received approvals or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
After a device is approved or cleared and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
 

· | establishment registration and device listing; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures; 
· | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or "off-label" uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; 
· | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and 
· | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act that may present a risk to health.

 
The FDA enforces regulatory requirements by conducting periodic, unannounced inspections and market surveillance. Inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. Thus, we must continue to spend time, money, and effort to maintain compliance.
 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:
 
· | warning letters; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | fines and civil penalties; 
· | unanticipated expenditures; 
· | delays in approving or refusal to approve our applications, including supplements;
· | withdrawal of FDA approval; 
· | product recall or seizure; 
· | interruption of production; 
· | operating restrictions; 
· | injunctions; and 
· | criminal prosecution. 

 
Contract manufacturers, specification developers, and some suppliers of components will be required to manufacture the Segnia and MML's Products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, equipment, purchase and handling of components, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. We expect that subcontractors' manufacturing facilities will be subject to domestic and international regulatory inspection and review. If the FDA believes contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down the manufacturing operations of contract manufacturers, require recall of products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations, or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot assure you that we or MML will be able to comply with all applicable FDA regulations.

Non-FDA United States Government Regulation
 
The advertising of our products will be subject to both FDA and Federal Trade Commission regulations. In addition, the sale and marketing of medical devices are subject to a complex system of federal and state laws and regulations intended to deter, detect, and respond to fraud and abuse in the healthcare system. These laws and regulations restrict and may prohibit pricing, discounting, commissions and other commercial practices that may be typical outside of the healthcare business. In particular, anti-kickback and self-referral laws and regulations will limit our flexibility in crafting promotional programs and other financial arrangements in connection with the sale of our products and related services, especially with respect to customers seeking reimbursement, if available, through Medicare or Medicaid and other government programs. Sanctions for violating federal laws include criminal and civil penalties that range from punitive sanctions, damage assessments, money penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments, or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or both. These laws also impose an affirmative duty on those receiving Medicare or Medicaid funding to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from the Medicare and other government programs.
 
Many states have adopted or are considering legislative proposals similar to the federal fraud and abuse laws, some of which extend beyond the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These state laws typically impose criminal and civil penalties similar to the federal laws.
 
In the ordinary course of their business, medical device manufacturers and suppliers have been and are subject regularly to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations. Federal and state legislation has increased funding for investigations and enforcement actions, which have increased dramatically over the past several years. This trend is expected to continue. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud also has increased, due in large part to amendments to the Civil False Claims Act in 1986 that were designed to encourage private persons to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits by private persons, known as qui tam relaters, may be filed by almost anyone, including physicians and their employees and patients, our employees, and even competitors.
 
International Device Regulation
 
The medical device regulatory process for international distribution is subject to government regulations that will vary by country from those having few or no regulations to those having extensive pre-market controls and pre-market acceptance.
 
In the EU and some additional countries, for example, medical devices require a Conformité Européenne ("CE") Mark in order to be placed in the market. The CE Mark certifies that a product has met EU consumer safety, health and environmental requirements. CE marking requires meeting the conditions of the European Directive which relates to the medical device to be approved. These directives generally regulate the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling, and post-market surveillance reporting activities for medical devices. Once the CE mark has been duly applied to a device, the manufacturer may commercially distribute the product in all countries that are members of the European Union, and in several other countries that recognize the CE Mark, such as Switzerland and Turkey. Similar to the US, once the device has received the CE mark, companies are required to report certain serious adverse events, are required to conduct post-market surveillance, and in some countries are required to register or list the products.
 
The CE mark allows manufacturers to place products on the market and permits free movement of goods. The manufacturer/product owner and its authorized representative in the EU are responsible for all aspects of the product assessment, testing, documentation, declaration of conformity and CE marking, even where a formal processing agent, the notified body, is required, as in the case of non-European based manufacturers. In all cases the manufacturer and representative assume the full responsibility and liability even when using the services of a consultant or test laboratory. Liability is not transferrable to third parties, including the notified body which is required for processing the certification. Generally, there is strict liability applied to medical devices subject to the CE marking by directive 85/374/EEC, and testing and reporting does not change or reduce this liability.
 
The European Commission has proposed a new regulatory scheme for medical devices. The proposals, which are currently being discussed by the Council of the European Union, will impose significant additional obligations on medical device companies. The changes being proposed will increase from the current regulation stricter requirements for clinical evidence and pre-market assessment of safety and performance, new classifications to indicate risk levels, requirements for third party testing by government accredited groups for some types of medical devices, and tightened and streamlined quality management system assessment procedures.  Additionally, the new regulations will require clinical evidence as well as analytical performance levels, the details of which are yet to be provided. If additional provisions proposed by the European Parliament are included in the new regulatory scheme, then there will be involvement of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in regulation of some types of medical devices, in the qualification and monitoring of notified bodies (NBs), and enhancing the roles of other bodies, including a new Medical Devices Coordination Group (MDCG).  The European Parliament's proposed revisions would impose enhanced competence requirements for NBs and "special notified bodies" (SNBs) for specific categories of devices. Although the extent of the proposed regulations is currently uncertain the medical device industry anticipates that there will be significant changes under these initiatives to the regulation of medical devices which will increase the time and costs for obtaining CE marking.
 
To facilitate CE Mark approval, it may be beneficial or necessary to complete the International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") certification process for the Company's comprehensive management system for the design and manufacture of medical devices.
