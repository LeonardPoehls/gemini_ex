Overview 
 We develop, manufacture, and market aesthetic treatment systems that enable plastic surgeons, dermatologists and other medical practitioners to perform non-invasive and minimally invasive procedures to remove hair, treat vascular and benign pigmented lesions, remove multi-colored tattoos, revitalize the skin, reduce fat through laser lipolysis, reduce cellulite, clear nails infected by toe fungus, ablate sweat glands and improve womens health. We also market radiofrequency, or RF, energy-sourced medical devices for precision surgical applications such as facial plastic and general surgery, gynecology, ear, nose, and throat procedures, ophthalmology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, podiatry and proctology. 
 Our product portfolio is composed of a broad range of energy sources including Alexandrite, diode, Nd: YAG, picosecond, pulse dye, Q-switched lasers, intense pulsed light and RF technology. We sell our products globally under the Cynosure, Palomar, ConBio and Ellman brand names through a direct sales force in the United States, Canada, France, Morocco, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, Australia, China, Japan and Korea, and through international distributors in over 120 other countries. 
 A key element of our business strategy is to launch innovative new products and technologies into high-growth aesthetic applications. Our research and development team builds on our existing broad range of laser, light-based technologies and other energies to develop new solutions and products to target unmet needs in significant aesthetic treatment markets. Innovation continues to be a strong contributor to our strength as we continue to add new products to our aesthetic treatment systems portfolio. Recent key innovations and acquisitions and significant partnerships have included: 
 

 | SculpSure® Laser System. We launched our SculpSure laser system for non-invasive fat reduction treatments in the second half of 2015. The SculpSure system requires the use of a Patented Applicator for Contouring, or PAC, to activate each applicator handpiece used in a treatment cycle. We offer PACs in keys containing 100 applicator uses. The SculpSure system is the first hyperthermic laser treatment system cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and has been cleared for marketing in the United Stated for the treatment of flanks and the abdomen. We have also received European Medical Device Directive certification from the European Notified Body, which allows us to place the CE Mark on the SculpSure system for distribution in the European Union and its member states. In December 2015, we received marketing authorization in Australia. In July 2016, we received clearance to market SculpSure in Canada and Korea.

 | Picosecond Technology Platform. In 2013, we launched our PicoSure® system, our picosecond laser technology platform using a 755nm wavelength for the treatment of tattoos and benign pigmented lesions. The PicoSure system was the first commercially available picosecond Alexandrite aesthetic laser platform. Picosecond lasers deliver pulses that are measured in trillionths of a second, in contrast with nanosecond technology, such as our MedLite® and RevLite products, which deliver pulses in billionths of a second. In February 2015, we received FDA clearance to market the PicoSure 532 nm wavelength, which we designed to more effectively treat red, yellow and orange tattoo ink colors, and we offer the wavelength as an upgrade to our current PicoSure customer base. In May 2016, we received FDA clearance to market the PicoSure 1064 nm wavelength, which we designed to more effectively treat black and other dark tattoo ink colors.

Industry 
 Aesthetic Market Opportunity 
 Medical Insight, an independent industry research and analysis firm, estimated that in 2016 total sales of products in the global aesthetic market exceeded $8 billion. Medical Insight believes that total sales of products in the global aesthetic market will increase 11% annually through 2020. 
 Key factors affecting growth rates in the markets for aesthetic treatment procedures and aesthetic laser equipment include: 
 

 | improvements in overall economic conditions and an expanding physician base;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the aging population of industrialized countries and the amount of discretionary income of the baby boomer demographic segment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | greater anticipated growth in Asian markets;
--+---------------------------------------------


 | the desire of many individuals to improve their appearance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


 | the development of technology that allows for safe and effective aesthetic treatment procedures as well as advances in treatable conditions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the impact of managed care and reimbursement on physician economics, which has motivated physicians to establish or seek to expand their elective aesthetic practices with procedures that are paid for directly by patients; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | reductions in cost per procedure, which has attracted a broader base of clients and patients for aesthetic treatment procedures.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Non-Traditional Physician Customers 
 Aesthetic treatment procedures that use lasers and other light-based equipment have traditionally been performed by dermatologists and plastic surgeons. Based on published membership information from professional medical organizations, there are approximately 19,000 dermatologists and plastic surgeons in the United States. A broader group of physicians in the United States, including primary care physicians, obstetricians and gynecologists, have incorporated aesthetic treatment procedures into their practices. These non-traditional physician customers are largely motivated to offer aesthetic procedures by the potential for a reliable revenue stream that is unaffected by managed care and government payor reimbursement economics. We believe that there are approximately 100,000 of these potential non-traditional physician customers in the United States and Canada, representing a significant market opportunity to be addressed by suppliers of lasers and other light-based aesthetic equipment. Some physicians are electing to open medical spas, often adjacent to their conventional office space, where they perform aesthetic procedures in an environment designed to feel less like a health care facility. 
The Structure of Skin and Conditions that Affect Appearance 
 The human skin consists of several layers. The epidermis is the outer layer and contains the cells that determine pigmentation, or skin color. The dermis is a thicker inner layer that contains hair follicles and large and small blood vessels. Beneath the dermis is a layer that contains subdermal fat. The dermis is composed of mostly collagen, which provides strength and flexibility to the skin. 
 The appearance of the skin may change over time due to a variety of factors, including age, sun damage, circulatory changes, deterioration of collagen and the human bodys diminished ability to repair and renew itself. These changes include: 
 

 | unwanted hair growth;
--+----------------------

 
7 
 

 | uneven pigmentation;
--+---------------------


 | wrinkles;
--+----------


 | blood vessels and veins that are visible at the skins surface;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | the appearance of cellulite and fat deposits; and
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | scarring.
--+----------

 Changes to the skin caused by pigmentation are called pigmented lesions and are the result of the accumulation of excess melanin, the substance that gives skin its color. Pigmented lesions are characterized by the brown color of melanin and include freckles, solar lentigines, also known as sun spots or age spots, and café au lait birthmarks. Changes to the skin caused by abnormally large or numerous blood vessels located under the surface of the skin are called vascular lesions. Vascular lesions are characterized by blood vessels that are visible through the skin or that result in a red appearance of the skin. Vascular lesions may be superficial and shallow in the skin or deep in the skin. Shallow vascular lesions include small spider veins, port wine birthmarks, facial veins and rosacea, a chronic skin condition that causes rosy coloration and acne-like pimples on the face. Deep vascular lesions include large spider veins and leg veins. 
 People with undesirable skin conditions, unwanted hair growth or tattoos often seek aesthetic treatments, including treatments using non-invasive or minimally-invasive laser and light-based technologies. 
 Laser and Light-Based Aesthetic Treatments 
 A laser is a device that creates and amplifies a coherent beam of light generally of one wavelength or a narrow band of wavelengths. Lasers have been used for medical and aesthetic applications since the 1960s. Intense pulsed light technology was introduced in the 1990s and uses flashlamps, rather than lasers, to generate incoherent light of multiple wavelengths, often referred to as a broadband of wavelengths. Both lasers and intense pulsed light devices can emit high energy light over varying pulse durations or time intervals. 
 By producing intense bursts of concentrated light, lasers and other light-based technologies selectively target melanin in hair follicles and pigmented lesions, hemoglobin in blood vessels and vascular lesions, water surrounding collagen in or below the dermis, ink in tattoos or fat tissue below the dermis. When the target absorbs sufficient energy, it becomes heated and/or mechanically disrupted to cause a biological reaction useful for treatment. The degree to which energy is absorbed in the skin depends upon the skin structure targetede.g., hair follicle or blood vesseland the skin typee.g., light or dark. Different types of lasers and other light-based technologies are needed to effectively treat the spectrum of skin types and conditions. As a result, an active aesthetic practice may require multiple laser or other light-based systems in order to offer treatments to its entire client base. 
 Different types of lasers are currently used for a wide range of aesthetic treatments. Each type of laser operates at its own wavelength, measured in nanometers, which corresponds to a particular emission and color in the light spectrum. The most common lasers used for non-invasive aesthetic treatments are: 
 

 | Pulse dye lasersmay produce light of various wavelengths; our pulse dye laser produces an orange light that functions at a shallow penetration depth.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Alexandrite lasersproduce a near infrared invisible light that functions with high power at a deep penetration depth.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | CO2 lasersproduce infrared invisible light that creates a deep ablation region.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Diode lasersmay produce light of various wavelengths; our diode lasers produce near infrared invisible light that functions at a deep penetration depth.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Erbium: glass lasersproduce a near infrared invisible light that functions at a deep penetration depth.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
8 
 

 | Er:YAG lasersproduce a near infrared invisible light that creates a shallow ablation region.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Nd:YAG lasersproduce a near infrared invisible light that functions over a wide range of penetration depths or when frequency doubled produce a green light that functions at a shallow penetration depth.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to selecting the appropriate wavelength for a particular application, laser and other light-based treatments require an appropriate balance among three other parameters to optimize safety and effectiveness for aesthetic treatments: 
 

 | energy levelthe amount of light emitted to heat the target;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


 | pulse durationthe time interval over which the energy is delivered; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | spot sizethe diameter of the energy beam.
--+-------------------------------------------

 As a result of the wide variety of aesthetic treatments, patient skin types and users of technology, customer purchasing objectives for aesthetic treatment systems are diverse. We believe that as aesthetic spas and non-traditional physician customers play increasingly important roles as purchasers of aesthetic treatment systems, the market for these products will become even more diverse. Specifically, we expect that owners of different types of aesthetic treatment practices will place different emphases on various system attributes, such as breadth of treatment applications, return on investment, upgradeability and price. Accordingly, we believe that there is significant market opportunity for a company that tailors its product offerings to meet the needs of a wide range of market segments. 
 Our Solution 
 We offer tailored customer solutions to address the market for non-invasive and minimally invasive laser and light-based aesthetic treatment applications, as well as RF energy based surgical and aesthetic applications. These solutions include non-invasive and minimally invasive procedures to remove hair, treat vascular and benign pigmented lesions, remove multi-colored tattoos, revitalize the skin, reduce fat through laser lipolysis, reduce cellulite, clear nails infected by toe fungus, ablate sweat glands and improve womens health.

System Components 
 Each of our systems consists of a control console and one or more handpieces. The systems acquired from Ellman consist of RF-based control consoles where energy is transferred through a handpiece or electrode. Our control consoles are each comprised of a graphical user interface, control system software and high voltage electronics. Depending on the system, the laser or other light source may be within the control console or the handpiece. The graphical user interface allows the practitioner to set the appropriate laser or flashlamp parameters, such as energy and pulse duration, to meet the requirements of a particular application for each particular patient. The control system software communicates the operators instructions from the graphical user interface to the systems components and manages system performance and calibration. For systems having multiple light sources within the control system, the graphical user interface allows the practitioner to change sources with the press of a button. For systems having light sources within handpieces, the graphical user interface automatically detects the connection of each handpiece and provides the appropriate display to the user. 
 The handpieces are used to deliver the light energy from the laser or other light source to the treatment area. For systems having the laser within the control console, the handpieces deliver the laser energy through a maneuverable optical fiber to the treatment area. For systems having the laser or flashlamp within the handpiece, the light energy is shaped through optical components before being delivered to the treatment area. 
 Several of our products use consumable parts. The PicoSure FOCUS Lens Array is a consumable micro lens array tip, which delivers the laser energy to the treatment area. The SmartLipo, Cellulaze and PrecisionTx systems use consumable laser fibers to deliver the laser energy directly to the treatment area. The surgical systems acquired from Ellman use consumable surgical electrodes and accessories. The SculpSure system requires the use of a PAC to activate each applicator handpiece used in a treatment cycle. We offer PACs in keys containing 100 applicator uses. 
 
13 
 
For many applications, practitioners use cooling to protect the skin. The cooling system may be a separate system or integrated into the laser or intense pulsed light system itself. When not integrated, we offer our customers the SmartCool treatment cooling system, which we purchase from a third-party supplier and sell as a private label product under the SmartCool brand. The SmartCool product has nine variable settings and allows the practitioner to provide a continuous flow of chilled air before, during and after treatment to cool and comfort the patients skin. The SmartCool handpiece, which is specially designed for use with our laser systems, interlocks with the laser handpiece. In contrast to some competitive cooling systems, there are no disposable supplies required to use our integrated cooling systems or our SmartCool system. 
 Applications 
 Practitioners use our products to perform a variety of non-invasive procedures to remove hair, treat vascular and benign pigmented lesions, remove multi-colored tattoos, revitalize the skin, reduce fat through laser lipolysis, reduce cellulite, clear nails infected by toe fungus, ablate sweat glands and improve womens health. Practitioners also use our products to perform minimally invasive procedures for the reduction of fat and the treatment of cellulite. The applications of our products are described below. 
 LaserBodySculpting  for the Removal of Unwanted Fat. The SmartLipo system was the first laser lipolysis system to offer a minimally invasive procedure for the removal of unwanted fat. LaserBodySculpting procedures with the SmartLipo system enables physicians to remove localized deposits of fat by inserting a small cannula, or metal tube, containing a laser fiber under the skin in direct contact with the treatment area. The laser energy causes the fat cells to rupture and melt. In addition, the laser energy promotes collagen shrinkage and causes a tissue tightening effect. LaserBodySculpting is a minimally invasive procedure; therefore, it can be performed under local anesthesia with minimal trauma in comparison to alternative liposuction procedures. We also offer our SmartLipo MPX system, which includes a second wavelength and features our patented MultiPlex technology, which enables the energy from two lasers to be blended during delivery by quickly following a pulse of energy from one laser with a pulse of energy from another laser, and also introduced in 2008 SmartSense and ThermaGuide our proprietary intelligent delivery systems. In addition, we sell our SmartLipo Triplex system, which includes a third wavelength. In 2013, we launched the PrecisionTx system for minimally invasive removal of fat in small areas such as the neck and jawline as well as ablation of axillary sweat glands. More recently, we launched in the second half of 2015 our SculpSure laser system, the worlds first FDA-cleared hyperthermic laser treatment for non-invasive lipolysis of the flanks and abdomen. Utilizing patented technology, SculpSure is designed to reduce fat non-invasively by eliminating subcutaneous fat cells. The versatile, hands-free device features a flexible applicator system to treat multiple anatomical areas of the body. SculpSure, which uses a 1060 nm diode laser, can treat an anatomical area in approximately 25 minutes. Patients are able to achieve desired results without downtime or surgery. 
 Cellulite. Cellulite is a deposit of fat that causes a dimple or other uneven appearance of the skin, typically around the thighs, hips and buttocks, more commonly found in women than men. According to published reports, an estimated 85% of women have some degree of cellulite. In 2011, we introduced our Cellulaze Cellulite Laser Workstation into the European community, and in 2012, we received FDA clearance to sell and market the product in the United States. The Cellulaze system was the worlds first minimally invasive surgical device designed to reduce cellulite by restoring the normal structure of the skin and underlying connective tissue. In the Cellulaze procedure, which is performed under a local anesthetic, the physician inserts a small cannula under the skin. Our SideLight 3D side-firing technology directs controlled, laser thermal energy to the treatment zones. The laser is designed to diminish the lumpy pockets of fat, release the areas of skin depression and increase the elasticity and thickness of the skin. Patients require just one treatment. Like the SmartLipo systems, the Cellulaze system incorporates the ThermaGuide intelligent delivery system which allows the physician to accurately monitor temperature and determine the treatment doses that will provide safe and more effective tissue tightening through tissue coagulation and maintain an even, controlled flow of laser energy.

Hair Removal. In a typical laser or pulsed light hair removal treatment the practitioner selects appropriate laser or pulsed light parameters based on the patients skin and hair types. If the system does not have integrated contact cooling in the handpiece, the practitioner often pre-cools the treatment area with cold air from the Zimmer SmartCool system. Next, the practitioner applies the handpiece to the target area. If the handpiece has integrated contact cooling, the skin is pre-cooled upon contact with the handpiece. The handpiece delivers laser or pulsed light energy to the skin and it is selectively absorbed by the target melanin in the hair follicle, destroying the hair follicle without harming the surrounding skin. We commercialized our first laser system for hair removal in 1997 and our first intense pulsed light system for hair removal and removal of pigmented lesions in 2001. Since then, we have launched several workstations including multiple light sources for the treatment of hair removal and various other skin conditions. Today, these systems include the Elite MPX and Icon systems. In 2012, we introduced the Vectus diode laser system for dedicated, high-volume hair removal. The Elite MPX workstation and Vectus system are our flagship products for hair removal. The Elite MPX workstation features a built-in Zimmer SmartCool skin cooling system which is integrated into a single compact model saving office space and reducing treatment time. Our Elite MPX and Apogee Elite products include two energy sources in one laser system: an Alexandrite laser, which is best suited for patients with light skin types, and an Nd:YAG laser, which is best suited for hair removal for patients with medium and dark skin types or tanned skin. The practitioner can switch between these two energy sources simply by pushing a button on the system console. Our Elite MPX allows the practitioner to blend the two energy sources for a customized treatment protocol. The Icon system provides multiple intense pulsed light handpieces for hair removal with integrated contact cooling, including the MaxR handpiece with large spot size and MaxRs handpiece with small spot size for use on all skin types and the MaxYs handpiece for hair removal on lighter skin types and removal of pigmented lesions. The Vectus diode laser features the largest spot size and most uniform beam profile available today and integrated contact cooling allowing providers to provide high-volume hair removal on a wide range of skin and hair types. 
 Treatment of Tattoos. In 2012, we received FDA clearance to market our PicoSure system, a picosecond laser technology platform, in the United States for removal of tattoos and benign pigmented lesions. We commenced commercialization of the PicoSure system in early 2013. Picosecond lasers deliver pulses that are measured in trillionths of a second in contrast with nanosecond technology, such as our MedLite and RevLite products, which deliver pulses in billionths of a second. The ultra-short pulses of the PicoSure laser provide both photothermal and photomechanical action. In clinical studies that we have conducted, the shorter pulse duration of the picosecond laser achieved increased efficiency in removing tattoo pigment, which we believe results in fewer treatments and better overall treatment outcomes than current laser technology. In October 2013, we launched the PicoSure FOCUS Lens Array for use with the PicoSure system to microscopically concentrate the PicoSure laser pulse to a precise depth and expose less than 10% of the skin to areas of high fluence while the surrounding skin is exposed to a low background fluence. In February 2015, we received FDA clearance to market the 532 nm wavelength for PicoSure, which we designed to more effectively treat red, yellow and orange tattoo ink colors and which we offer as an upgrade to our current PicoSure customer base. In May 2016, we received FDA clearance to market the 1064 nm wavelength for PicoSure, which we designed to more effectively treat black and other dark colored tattoo inks. The MedLite and RevLite systems provide frequency-doubled q-switched Nd:YAG laser energy for tattoo removal and can be used with the MultiLite Dye handpieces to provide 585 nm (yellow) and 650 nm (red) laser energy for full-color tattoo removal. 
 Anti-Aging. We believe the marketplace has moved to a less invasive approach for treating the indications of aging, including the treatment of wrinkles, pigmentation, redness and overall skin rejuvenation. Anti-aging treatments were historically performed by physicians who could only target one condition and one skin layer during each treatment. Previously, patients often faced longer, more painful procedures that penetrated deep into the dermal layers and could potentially damage healthy skin. Our PicoSure, Icon, Elite, MedLite and RevLite systems provide a non-ablative and micro-ablative treatment approach for wrinkles, skin texture, skin discoloration and skin tightening through tissue coagulation. 
 Treatment of Benign Pigmented Lesions. Given that the pigment associated with pigmented lesions is generally located close to the skin surface, practitioners generally do not pre-cool the target area. To treat 
 
15 
 
 pigmented lesions, the practitioners apply laser or intense pulsed light energy to the treatment area to damage or destroy the lesion. The lesion will then form a scab that sloughs off over time to reveal clearer skin beneath. Our PicoSure system delivers picosecond pulses of Alexandrite laser energy to remove benign pigmented lesions using both photothermal and photomechanical action. The PicoSure system may be used with the PicoSure FOCUS Lens Array to microscopically concentrate the PicoSure laser pulse to a precise depth and exposes less than 10% of the skin to areas of high fluence while the surrounding skin is exposed to low background fluence. Our MedLite and RevLite laser systems provide frequency-doubled Q-Switched Nd:YAG laser energy for removal of pigmented lesions. The MedLite provides a true flat-top beam profile for consistent results. The Icon system provides the LuxYs and LuxG pulsed light handpieces for the removal of pigmented lesions and the 1540 nm fractional laser for the removal of melasma. The broadband light of the LuxYs handpiece is optimally filtered to treat darker pigmented lesions. The Elite system provides 755 nm Alexandrite laser energy for the treatment of pigmented lesions. 
 Treatment of Vascular Lesions. To treat vascular lesions, the practitioner generally first pre-cools the target area, with the system handpiece or an external cooling system, and then uses the system handpiece to deliver laser or intense pulsed light energy to the treatment area to damage or destroy the blood vessels. One or more treatments may be required depending upon the type of lesion. Our flagship Icon system provides the MaxG intense pulsed light handpiece with Dynamic Spectrum Shifting and dual-band filters for more uniform heating across the entire diameter of larger vessels. For leg veins, the Icon system provides the Lux 1064+ laser handpiece. The Elite system also provides 1064 nm laser energy for treatment of vascular lesions, both facial and leg veins. 
 Our Cynergy system is also used for the treatment of vascular lesions. The Cynergy system combines a pulse dye laser, which is best suited for treating shallow vascular lesions, such as port wine birthmarks, facial veins and rosacea, and an Nd:YAG laser, which is best suited for treating large or deep veins, such as leg veins. The practitioner can switch between these two energy sources simply by pressing a button on the system console. The Cynergy system also includes our patented MultiPlex technology that enables the energy from the two lasers to be blended during delivery by quickly following a pulse of energy from the pulse dye laser with a pulse of energy from the Nd:YAG laser. In addition to the Cynergy system, certain of our other systems can be used for the treatment of vascular lesions. 
 Treatment of Scars. Our PicoSure, Icon, MedLite and RevLite systems use short pulses of micro-fine laser light to reach deeply into the skins sub-layers, treating the support structure. The bodys natural healing process sweeps away older, damaged tissue and rebuilds it with fresh, new collagen and elastin to remove or reduce the appearance of the scar. 
 Axillary Gland Ablation. Historically, topical antiperspirants or oral medications have been recommended as the best treatment available. Our PrecisionTx system provides minimally invasive laser ablation of the axillary glands (glands in the armpit area). 
 Treatment of Onychomycosis. Onychomycosis is a condition marked by the growth of fungus under the nail. Fungi feed on keratin, the protein that makes up the hard surface of the toenails. The infected nail often turns darker in color, and debris may accumulate under the nail. As the infection continues, the nail either may crumble gradually and fall off or thicken. Our PinPointe FootLaser uses laser light to kill the fungus that lives in and under the nail without causing damage to the nail or the surrounding skin. The treatment typically takes 20 minutes with no downtime. 
 Womens Health. GSM is a condition marked by the deterioration of the vaginal walls associated with the loss of estrogen due to aging, hormonal treatments for breast cancer, and other conditions affecting primarily postmenopausal women, breast cancer survivors and women who have undergone hysterectomies. The MonaLisa Touch delivers short CO2 ablative laser pulses to the vaginal wall, decreasing GSM symptoms such as vaginal dryness, soreness and itching as well as painful urination and intercourse. The MonaLisa Touch system is 
 
16 
 
 designed to stimulate and promote the regeneration of collagen fibers and the restoration of hydration and elasticity within the vaginal mucosa. The procedure, which can be administered in a doctors office, requires no anesthesia and has been performed on thousands of patients worldwide. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We sell our aesthetic treatment systems to the traditional physician customer base of dermatologists and plastic surgeons as well as to non-traditional physician customers who are providing aesthetic services using laser and light-based technology. Non-traditional physician customers can include primary care physicians, obstetricians and gynecologists. 
 We target potential customers through office visits, trade shows and trade journals. We also conduct clinical workshops and webinars featuring recognized expert panelists and opinion leaders to promote existing and new treatment techniques using our products. We believe that these workshops and webinars enhance customer loyalty and provide us with new sales opportunities. We also use direct mail programs to target specific segments of the market that we seek to access, such as members of medical societies and attendees at meetings sponsored by medical societies or associations. We actively maintain a public relations program to promote coverage of our products on daytime television shows in the United States and Europe and we are active on popular social media outlets. In addition, our products are featured in several publications around the world.
We do not provide financing to our customers to purchase our products. If a potential customer requests financing, we refer the customer to third-party financing sources. 
Physician Sales 
 We sell our products to physicians in North America through a direct sales force. Outside of North America, we sell our products to physicians through a direct sales force in France, Morocco, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, Australia, China, Japan and Korea and through independent distributors in over 120 other countries. 
 We conduct our own international sales and service operations through wholly owned subsidiaries in France, Morocco, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Australia, China, Japan, Korea and Mexico. We seek distributors in international markets where we do not believe that a direct sales presence is warranted or feasible. In those markets, we select distributors that have extensive knowledge of our industry and their local markets. Our distributors sell, install and service our products. We require our distributors to invest in service training and equipment, to stock and supply maintenance and service parts for our systems, to attend exhibitions and industry meetings and, in some instances, to commit to minimum sales amounts to gain or retain exclusivity. We have written distribution agreements with most of our third-party distributors. Generally, the written agreements with our distributors have terms of between one and two years. 
 See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for revenues by geographic region. 
 Service and Support 
 We support our customers with a range of services, including installation and product training, business and practice development consulting and product service and maintenance. In North America, our field service organization has 59 field service professionals. Outside of North America, we employ 82 field service professionals. 
 In connection with direct sales of our aesthetic treatment systems, we arrange for the installation of the system and initial product training. The installation is conducted by our field service engineers. The costs of installation and initial training for North American purchasers are all included in the purchase price of our systems. We also offer for an additional charge a more comprehensive package of services from pre-qualified third-party consultants. Our training and additional services are particularly appealing to the non-traditional physician customer and aesthetic spa segments of the market, which have less familiarity with the business aspects of laser and light-based aesthetic treatments than dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons. 
 
17 
 
Within North America, we strive to respond to all service calls within 24 hours to minimize disruption of our customers businesses. We have designed our products in a modular fashion to enable quick and efficient service and support. Specifically, we build these products with several separate components that can easily be removed and replaced when the product is being serviced. We provide initial warranties on our products to cover parts and service, and we offer extended warranty packages that vary by type of product and level of service desired. Our base warranty typically covers parts and service for one year. We offer extended warranty arrangements through service contracts. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to increase our recurring customer revenues by increasing the percentage of our customers that enter into service contracts for our systems. 
 Research and Development 
 Our research and development team consists of 84 employees, including four physicists, with a broad base of experience in lasers and optoelectronics. Our research and development team works closely with opinion leaders and customers, both individually and through our sponsored seminars, to understand unmet needs and emerging applications in the field of aesthetic skin treatments and to innovate and develop new products and improvements to our existing products. They also conduct and coordinate clinical trials of our products. Our research and development team builds on the significant base of patented and proprietary intellectual property that we have developed in the fields of laser and other light-based technologies since our inception in 1991. From time to time, we may enter into collaborative research and development agreements to enhance our technology and develop new products. 
 Our research and development expenses were $29.0 million, $22.3 million and $22.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 Manufacturing and Raw Materials 
 We manufacture several of our products, including our Cynergy, Accolade, Elite MPX and PicoSure product families. We manufacture these products with components and subassemblies purchased from third-party suppliers. Accordingly, our manufacturing operations consist principally of assembly and testing of our systems and integration of our proprietary optics and software. We design the products that we manufacture so that they are built in a modular fashion. This approach enables us to manufacture and service our products more efficiently. We purchase many of our components and subassemblies from third-party manufacturers on an outsourced basis. We use one third-party to assemble and test many of the components and subassemblies for our Cynergy, Elite MPX and PicoSure product families. 
 For other products, such as the Elite family and SculpSure products, as well as the Icon and Vectus systems, we rely on third parties for manufacturing and testing. In addition, we depend on El.En. for the SLT II laser system that we integrate with our own proprietary software and delivery systems into our SmartLipo Triplex, Cellulaze and PrecisionTx systems. 
 We use Alexandrite rods in the lasers for our Elite and PicoSure systems. We depend exclusively on Northrop Grumman SYNOPTICS to supply the Alexandrite rods to us, and we are aware of no alternative supplier of Alexandrite rods meeting our quality standards. We offer our SmartCool cooling systems for use with our laser aesthetic treatment systems, and we depend exclusively on Zimmer Elektromedizin GmbH to supply SmartCool systems to us. We use diode laser bars from Coherent to manufacture our Vectus diode laser, and we use diode laser modules from Dilas to manufacture our SculpSure® laser system. Although alternative suppliers exist for the diode laser bars, they could take months to qualify and implement. 
 We do not have long-term contracts with our third-party manufacturers or sole source suppliers. We generally purchase components and subassemblies as well as our other supplies on a purchase order basis or with one year purchase agreements. If for any reason, our third-party manufacturers or sole source suppliers are not 
 
18 
 
 willing or able to provide us with components, subassemblies or supplies in a timely fashion, or at all, our ability to manufacture and sell many of our products could be impaired. To date, we have been able to obtain adequate outsourced manufacturing services and supplies of components from our third-party manufacturers and suppliers in a timely manner. We believe that over time alternative component and subassembly manufacturers and suppliers can be identified if our current third-party manufacturers and suppliers fail to fulfill our requirements. 
 We offer our MonaLisa Touch and PinPointe FootLaser systems pursuant to distribution agreements. 
 Backlog 
 We generally do not maintain a significant backlog. As a result, we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is indicative of future sales levels. 
El.En. Commercial Relationship 
 We have several distribution agreements with El.En. Under one of these agreements, we purchase from El.En. its SmartLipo MPX system and its proprietary SLT II laser system. The SLT II laser system is an essential component of our SmartLipo Triplex, Cellulaze, and PrecisionTx systems, which also incorporate our proprietary software and delivery systems. We have exclusive worldwide rights under this agreement to sell the SmartLipo MPX system and our products containing the SLT II laser system. Under another distribution agreement with El.En. and separate distribution agreements with certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain, we purchase from El.En. its MonaLisa Touch laser system. 
 The prices at which we purchase these laser systems from El.En. are specified in the agreements; however, they may be changed by El.En. at its discretion upon 30 days notice. El.En. is required to provide us with training for the products we distribute under these agreements, as well as marketing and other sales support for such products as we and El.En. may agree. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell and promote our systems containing these laser systems, and we are responsible for obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for such products. The first distribution agreement has an initial term that expires in October 2019, and the second distribution agreement has an initial term that expires in November 2021. Each agreement automatically renews for additional one-year terms unless either party provides notice of termination at least six months prior to the expiration of the initial term or any subsequent renewal term. We or El.En. may terminate these agreements at any time based upon material uncured breaches by, or the insolvency of, the other party. In addition, El.En. may terminate each agreement if we do not meet annual minimum purchase obligations specified in the agreement and we may terminate if El.En. rejects a purchase order that is in line with our forecast. 
Patents, Proprietary Technology and Trademarks 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. These legal protections afford only limited protection for our technology. 
 As of December 31, 2016, we were the sole owner of over 50 U.S. patents, as well as many U.S. pending applications and foreign patents and pending applications. We are also joint owners, including with El.En., of certain patents and pending applications. We are also licensed non-exclusively to certain patents owned by third parties and we have granted exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to third parties to certain of our patents, 
 
19 
 
 pending applications and know how. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. We expect our issued and exclusively licensed patents to expire at various dates that range from as early as February 2018 to as late as April 2031. 
 Prior to their expiration in the United States on February 1, 2015 and their foreign counterparts in several foreign jurisdictions on January 31, 2016, our Palomar subsidiary was the exclusive licensee of certain hair removal patents owned by Massachusetts General Hospital or MGH. Palomar has granted royalty bearing, non-exclusive sublicenses to those patents to third parties, including to us in 2006. We paid a royalty to MGH for sales of our hair removal products. Palomar was also the non-exclusive licensee of several other U.S. patents as well as corresponding foreign patents and pending applications owned by MGH, and Palomar was the joint owner with MGH and, in some cases, the exclusive licensee, of other U.S. patents as well as corresponding U.S. pending applications and foreign patents and pending applications. Palomar has also granted non-exclusive rights to other parties to other patents and received non-exclusive licenses to patents owned by other parties. 
 The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted. 
 We do not know whether any of our patent applications or those patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or shorten the term of patent protection that we may have for our products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us. 
 We seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees, consultants and any third party with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and often agreements that include assignment of rights provisions to us. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our intellectual property may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Due to rapid changes in technology, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments and enhancements to existing products are as important as the various legal protections of our technology to establishing and maintaining a leadership position. 
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult. Litigation may be necessary to enforce intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such resulting litigation, even if we are ultimately successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology. Any failure by us to meaningfully protect our proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 We use registered and common law trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks is an important factor in marketing our products. We have also registered some of our marks in 
 
20 
 
 a number of foreign countries. In addition, El.En. has registered the SmartLipo® and MonaLisa Touch marks in the United States. Although we have a foreign trademark registration program for selected marks, we may not be able to register or use such marks in each foreign country in which we seek registration. 
 Our management believes that none of our current products infringe upon valid claims of patents owned by third parties of which we are aware. However, there have been claims made against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not make further claims of infringement with respect to our current or future products. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert our attention and resources, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. A successful claim of intellectual property infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology or develop or license technology with comparable functionality could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 Competition 
 Our industry is subject to intense competition. Our products compete against laser and other energy-based products offered by public companies, such as Cutera, Syneron Medical and ZELTIQ Aesthetics (whose acquisition by Allergan is pending), as well as several smaller specialized private companies, such as Alma Lasers (acquired in May 2013 by Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical) and Lumenis. Some of these competitors have strong financial and human resources and have established reputations, as well as established worldwide distribution channels and sales and marketing capabilities. Additional competitors may enter the market, and we are likely to compete with new companies in the future. Our products also compete against non-laser and non-light-based medical products, such as BOTOX® and collagen injections, and surgical and non-surgical aesthetic procedures, such as face lifts, chemical peels, abdominoplasty, liposuction, microdermabrasion, sclerotherapy and electrolysis. 
 Competition among providers of aesthetic laser and other light-based products is characterized by significant research and development efforts and rapid technological progress. There are few barriers that would prevent new entrants or existing competitors from developing products that would compete directly with ours. There are many companies, both public and private, that are developing innovative devices that use both light-based and alternative technologies for aesthetic and medical applications. Accordingly, our success depends in part on developing and commercializing new and innovative applications of laser and other light-based technology and identifying new markets for and applications of existing products and technology. 
 To compete effectively, we have to demonstrate that our products are attractive alternatives to other devices and treatments by differentiating our products on the basis of performance, reputation, quality of customer support and price. Breadth of product offering is also important. We believe that we perform favorably with respect to each of these factors. However, we have encountered and expect to continue to encounter potential customers who, due to pre-existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to, or prefer the products offered by these competitors. Potential customers also may decide not to purchase our products, or to delay such purchases, based on a decision to recoup the cost of expensive products that they may have already purchased from our competitors. In addition, we expect that competitive pressures may result in price reductions and reduced margins over time for our products. 
 Government Regulation 
 Our products are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the United States and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, or EU. These governmental authorities regulate the marketing and distribution of medical devices in their respective jurisdictions. The regulations cover the entire life cycle of the product, including the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, packaging, storage, labeling, advertising and promotion of the devices. In addition, post-approval 
 
21 
 
 monitoring and reporting, as well as import and export of medical devices, are subject to various regulatory requirements. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, including the EU, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 Review and Clearance of Medical Devices in the United States 
 The FDA strictly regulates medical devices in the United States. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, a medical device is defined as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part or accessory, which is, among other things: intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes. Unless an exemption applies, a new medical device may not be marketed in the United States unless it has been cleared by the FDA through filing of a 510(k) premarket notification, or 510(k), or approved by the FDA pursuant to a premarket approval application, or PMA. Both premarket notifications and premarket approval applications, when submitted to the FDA, must be accompanied by a user fee, unless exempt. 
 The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes depending on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Class I devices have the lowest level or risk associated with them, and are subject to general controls, including labeling, premarket notification and adherence to the QSR. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards. Class III devices, which have the highest level of risk associated with them, are subject to most of the aforementioned requirements as well as to premarket approval. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirement, although manufacturers of these devices are still subject to registration, listing, labeling and QSR requirements. 
 In connection with its clearance or approval of device products, the FDA requires that we manufacture our products in accordance with its Quality System Regulation, or QSR. The QSR covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in, among other things, the shutdown of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products 
 All of our current products are Class II devices. To date, we have used exclusively the 510(k) premarket notification process to obtain regulatory clearance from the FDA for the marketing and sale of our products in the United States. 
 510(k) Premarket Notification 
 A 510(k) is a premarket submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the proposed device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective (i.e., substantially equivalent) to another legally marketed device, or predicate device, that did not require premarket approval. In evaluating a 510(k), the FDA will determine whether the device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and (a) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device, or (b) has different technological characteristics, and (1) the data supporting substantial equivalence contains information, including appropriate clinical or scientific data, if deemed necessary by the FDA, that demonstrates that the device is as safe and as effective as a legally marketed device, and (2) does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device. Most 510(k)s do not require clinical data for clearance, but the FDA may request such data. 
 
22 
 
The FDA seeks to review and act on a 510(k) within 90 days of submission, but it may take longer if the agency finds that it requires more information to review the 510(k). If the FDA concludes that a new device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the new device will be classified in Class III and the manufacturer will be required to submit a PMA to market the product. With the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or the FDASIA, a de novo pathway is directly available for certain low to moderate risk devices that do not qualify for the 510(k) pathway due to the absence of a predicate device. 
 510(k) and Product Modifications 
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, a modification that could affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a change in its intended use, will likely require a new clearance or approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturers determination. We have modified aspects of various products since receiving regulatory clearance and believe that new 510(k) clearances are not required for these modifications. The FDAs position on when a device modification triggers the need to submit a new 510(k) has been evolving in recent years, and it is therefore difficult to predict whether the FDA will disagree with us. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or premarket approval. The FDA could also require us, among other things, to cease marketing and distributing the modified device, and to recall any sold devices, until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 
 Modifications to a 510(k)-cleared medical device may require the submission of another 510(k) or a PMA if the changes could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or constitute a major change in the intended use of the device. Modifications to a 510(k)-cleared device frequently require the submission of a traditional 510(k), but modifications meeting certain conditions may be candidates for FDA review under a Special 510(k). If a device modification requires the submission of a 510(k), but the modification does not affect the intended use of the device or alter the fundamental technology of the device, then summary information that results from the design control process associated with the cleared device can serve as the basis for clearing the application. A Special 510(k) allows a manufacturer to declare conformance to design controls without providing new data. When the modification involves a change in material, the nature of the new material will determine whether a traditional or Special 510(k) is necessary. 
 Premarket Approval Application 
 The PMA process for approval to market a medical device is more complex, costly and time consuming than the 510(k) clearance procedure. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical, manufacturing, control and labeling information, that demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After a PMA is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to determine whether it is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the PMA is complete, the FDA will file the PMA. The FDA is subject to performance goal review times for PMAs and may issue a decision letter as a first action on a PMA within 180 days of filing, but if it has questions, it will likely issue a first major deficiency letter within 150 days of filing. It may also refer the PMA to an FDA advisory panel for additional review, and will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the QSR, either of which could extend the 180-day response target. In addition, the FDA may request additional information or request the performance of additional clinical trials before it will reconsider the approval of the PMA or as a condition of approval, in which case the trials must be completed after the PMA is approved. 
 If the FDAs evaluations of both the PMA and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter authorizing commercial marketing or an approvable letter that usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval. If the FDAs evaluations are not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The agency may determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed while the trials are 
 
23 
 
 conducted and the data acquired are submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Even with additional trials, the FDA may not approve the PMA application. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years, and the process can be expensive and uncertain. Moreover, even if the FDA approves a PMA, the agency can impose post-approval conditions that it believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. After approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required for a modification to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process. None of our products are currently approved under a PMA approval. 
 Clinical Studies and the Investigational Device Exemption 
 When FDA clearance or approval of a device requires human clinical trials, and if the device presents a significant risk, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to file an investigational device exemption, or IDE, application with the FDA and obtain and IDE prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The sponsor must support the IDE application with appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. An IDE application is considered approved 30 days after it has been received by the FDA, unless the FDA otherwise informs the sponsor prior to 30 calendar days from the date of receipt, that the IDE is approved with conditions or disapproved. The sponsor also must obtain approval from the Institutional Review Board, or IRB, overseeing the clinical trial. The FDA, and the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 For the purposes of determining whether an IDE is required, FDA has issued regulations that describe significant and nonsignificant risk device studies and the procedures for obtaining approval to begin the study differ accordingly. A significant risk device presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. Significant risk devices are devices that are substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or in preventing impairment to human health. Studies of devices that pose a significant risk require both FDA approval and an approval of an independent institutional review board, or IRB, prior to initiation of a clinical study. Nonsignificant risk devices are devices that do not pose a significant risk to the human subjects. A nonsignificant risk device study requires only IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study. 
 Clinical trials, including clinical trials that do not require prior IDE approval, must be conducted in accordance with the FDAs IDE and other regulations, including, among other things, informed consent, monitoring and recordkeeping requirements. Clinical studies conducted on 510(k) cleared devices, when used or investigated in accordance with the labeling reviewed by the FDA, are exempt from most of the FDAs IDE requirements. While we believe that a majority of our devices present only non-significant risks and, therefore, do not require IDE submission to the FDA, we have sought IDE approvals for certain study protocols in the past. We perform clinical trials to provide data to support the FDA clearance process for our products and for use in our sales and marketing efforts. Future clinical trials of our products may also require that we submit and obtain approval of an IDE from the FDA prior to commencing clinical trials. 
 Post-marketing restrictions and enforcement 
 After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: 
 

 | establishment of registration and device listing;
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses, and other requirements related to promotional activities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
24 
 

 | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that may present a risk to health; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA may require us to maintain a system for tracking our products through the chain of distribution to the patient level. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are also subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations. These inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. Thus, we must continue to spend time, money and effort to maintain compliance. 
 The failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: 
 

 | untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | refusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or new intended uses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 The FDA also has the authority to require us to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device that we have manufactured or distributed. 
 FDA Regulation of Radiation-Emitting Products 
 The FDA regulates radiation emitting electronic products even when they are not intended to be used for medical purposes. X-rays, microwaves, radio waves, laser, visible light, sound, ultrasound, and ultraviolet light are a few examples of the many types of radiation that may be produced by an electronic product. Diagnostic X-ray systems, laser products, laser light shows, and microwave ovens are a few examples out of the many different electronic products that emit radiation subject to FDA regulation. Many radiation emitting electronic products are also medical devices. In those cases, the products must comply with two independent sets of regulationsradiation safety regulations that apply to radiation emitting electronic products, as well as medical device regulations that apply to all medical devices. 
 Under the Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions of the FDCA, the FDA has established regulations specifying electronic product performance standards covering several varieties of radiation emitting electronic products. Companies that manufacture or import electronic products subject to an FDA performance standard are required to submit various electronic product reports to the FDA to demonstrate that their products comply with the standard. The most important and basic of the reports is the Electronic Product Initial Report. When a manufacturer or importer submits an Electronic Product Initial Report to the FDA, the FDA reviews the report to ensure compliance with any applicable manufacturing and performance standards. The FDA then issues Accession Numbers to the manufacturer. The FDA and U.S. Customs require declaration of Accession Numbers 
 
25 
 
 on import forms when importing electronic products into the U.S. Unless exempted by the radiation safety regulations, a manufacturer or importer must also submit to the FDA follow-up reports for product updates or modifications, as well as an annual report for their radiation emitting electronic products. The radiation safety regulations provide specific certification and labeling requirements for electronic products. Labeling, which includes user manuals, must contain certain information, such as warnings, declarations and clear and concise instructions for use and service. The information must also be formatted in accordance with the regulations. The law and applicable federal regulations also require laser manufacturers to maintain manufacturing, testing and sales records, and report product defects. Various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices installed, depending on the class of the product. 
 Other Regulatory Requirements 
 Other laws that apply to our activities include the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as the Sunshine Act). It sets forth reporting and disclosure requirements for applicable manufacturers of drugs, biological, medical devices and medical supplies with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain physicians and teaching hospitals. The final rules implementing the Sunshine Act are complex, ambiguous, and broad in scope. We are also subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to the environment, health and safety, land use and quality assurance. We believe that compliance with these laws and regulations as currently in effect will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive and financial position. In 2013, most of the products and systems that we sell became subject to an excise tax on sales of certain medical devices in the United States after December 31, 2012 by the manufacturer, producer or importer in an amount equal to 2.3% of the sale price. This excise tax was suspended for the years 2016 and 2017. Under the law, additional charges, including warranties, may be deemed to be included in the sale price for purposes of determining the amount of the excise tax. 
Healthcare Law and Regulation 
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and selection of medical devices for patients. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 

 | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
26 
 

 | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing ·or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Review and Approval of Medical Devices in the European Union 
 The European Union, or EU, has a coordinated system for the authorization of medical devices. The EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC, as amended) sets out the basic regulatory framework for medical devices in the European Union. In the EU our medical devices must comply with the Essential Requirements in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, which we refer to as the Essential Requirements. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the Certificate of Conformity mark, or CE Mark, to our medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the European Economic Area, or EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue a CE Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a third-party organization designated by competent authorities of an EU country to conduct conformity assessments, which is referred to as a Notified Body. The Notified Body would typically audit and examine products technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the devices before issuing a CE Certificate of Conformity demonstrating compliance with the relevant Essential Requirements. 
 The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the type and class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a Notified Body, an independent and neutral institution appointed by a country to conduct the conformity assessment. This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturers quality system and specific testing of the manufacturers device. An assessment by a Notified Body in one member state of the European Union or the European Free Trade Association is required in order for a manufacturer to distribute the product commercially throughout these countries. ISO 9001 and ISO 13845 certification are voluntary harmonized standards. Compliance establishes the presumption of conformity with the quality management system and compliance with the requirements of the Medical Device Directive permits our Notified Body to issue the CE mark for our products. In 2003, we received our certification for ISO 13485, which replaced our EN 46001 certification. 
 Even after we receive a CE Certificate of Conformity enabling us to affix the CE Mark on a product and to sell our product in the EEA countries, a Notified Body or a competent authority may require post-marketing studies of our product. Failure to comply with such requirements in a timely manner could result in the withdrawal of our CE Certificate of Conformity and the recall or withdrawal of our product from the market in 
 
27 
 
 the EU. Moreover, each CE Certificate of Conformity is valid for a maximum of five years, but more commonly three years. At the end of each period of validity we are required to apply to the Notified Body for a renewal of the CE Certificate of Conformity. There may be delays in the renewal of the CE Certificate of Conformity or the Notified Body may require modifications to our products or to the related Technical Files before it agrees to issue the new CE Certificate of Conformity. 
 In addition, we must inform the Notified Body that carried out the conformity assessment of the medical devices we market or sell in the EEA of any planned substantial changes to our devices that could affect compliance with the Essential Requirements or the devices intended purpose. The Notified Body will then assess the changes and verify whether they affect the products conformity with the Essential Requirements or the conditions for the use of the devices. If the assessment is favorable, the Notified Body will issue a new CE Certificate of Conformity or an addendum to the existing CE Certificate of Conformity attesting compliance with the Essential Requirements. If it is not, we may not be able to continue to market and sell the product in the EEA. 
 On September 26, 2012, the European Commission adopted a package of legislative proposals designed to replace the existing regulatory framework for medical devices in the EU. These proposals provide for a revision of the current regulatory framework for medical devices in the EU to strengthen patient safety, transparency and product traceability. The proposals, for instance, include reinforced rules governing clinical evaluation throughout the life of the device, improved traceability of devices in the supply chain, including a phased and risk-based introduction of unique device identification, or UDI, improved market surveillance and vigilance, as well as better co-ordination between national regulators, increased powers for Notified Bodies to undertake unannounced inspections and strengthened supervision of Notified Bodies by member states. The European Commissions proposals may undergo significant amendments as they are reviewed by the European Council and European Parliament as part of the EU legislative process. If and when adopted, the proposed new legislation may prevent or delay the EU approval or clearance of our products under development or may impact our ability to modify our currently EU approved or cleared products on a timely basis and impose additional costs relating to clinical evaluation, vigilance and product traceability. 
 Marketing and Sales Considerations in the EU 
 In the EU, medical devices may be promoted only for the intended purpose for which the devices have been CE Marked. Failure to comply with this requirement could lead to the imposition of penalties by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. The penalties could include warnings, orders to discontinue the promotion of the medical device, seizure of the promotional materials and fines. Promotional materials must also comply with various laws and codes of conduct developed by medical device industry bodies in the EU governing promotional claims, comparative advertising, advertising of medical devices reimbursed by the national health insurance systems and advertising to the general public. 
 Product Vigilance and Post-approval Monitoring in the EU 
 Additionally, all manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EU are legally bound to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices they produce or sell to the competent authority in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred. In the EU, manufacturers must comply with the EU Medical Device Vigilance System. Under this system, incidents must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU countries, and manufacturers are required to take field safety corrective actions, or FSCAs, to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 982 employees, including 439 employees in sales and marketing functions, 84 employees in research, development and engineering functions, 347 employees in manufacturing and service functions and 112 employees in general and administrative functions. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe our employee relations are good.
