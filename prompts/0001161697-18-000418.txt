Item 1. BUSINESS.
Company Overview

Black Cactus Global, Inc. (formerly Envoy Group Corp.) (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Florida on April 8, 2013, with a fiscal year end of April 30. Until June 2017, we had not established any business operations and had not achieved any revenues. Until then, we were in the process of identifying and evaluating feasible business opportunities in the consumer products and technology industries. 

The address of the head office is Suite 200, 8275 South Eastern Avenue, Las Vegas, Nevada 89123. The Company’s plan is to develop a technology business in digital currency mining. On December 4, 2017, the Company changed its name to “Black Cactus Global, Inc.”

Employees

As of April 30, 2018, we had no employees. Our officers provided services to our company on a contract basis as needed. 

Emerging Growth Company

We are an “emerging growth company” under the federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.

 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012.

The JOBS Act permits an “emerging growth company” such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. Pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards for an “emerging growth company.” This election will permit us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that will have different effective dates for public and private companies until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Upon the issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to our financial statements and has a different effective date for public and private companies, we will disclose the date on which adoption is required for non-emerging growth companies and the date on which we will adopt said accounting standard. We may take advantage of the extended transition period until the first to occur of the date we (i) are no longer an “emerging growth company” or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period. Consequently, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

For additional discussion regarding the JOBS Act and the exemptions available to “emerging growth companies” thereunder, please refer to the risk factor entitled “We are an “emerging growth company” and we cannot be certain if we will be able to maintain such status or if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.”
