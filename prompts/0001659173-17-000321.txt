Item 1.   Business 
General Corporate History
 
ATI Modular Technology Corp. (“ATI Modular,” “we,” “us,” or the “Company”) are an operating company engaged in the development and the exporting of modular energy efficient technology and processes that allow government and private enterprises in China to use US-based methods for creating modular spaces, facilities, and properties. We are in the business of all aspects of modular construction, including but not limited to, (a) the furtherance of modular construction technology, education and development in developed and undeveloped countries, (b) acquisition and/or installation of construction equipment, materials, furnishings, adware, insulation, flooring, roofing, wiring, plumbing, heating and air conditioning, and landscaping, and (c) other businesses directly or tangentially related to these lines of services, including assisting businesses and entrepreneurs in securing naming, licensing or promotional rights, driving internet and media traffic, increasing visibility of product and name recognition, and other services. As with any business plan that is aspirational in nature, there is no assurance we will be able to accomplish all of our objectives or that we will be able to meet our financing needs to accomplish our objectives. We believe that we are a “shell company,” as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. Our CIK number is 0001697426, and we have selected December 31 as our fiscal year.
 
In China, the modular construction industry is new and in its very early stages. Though we expect other competitors to come forth, at this time, there are only three other competitors, and those competitors are based in China. None of the competitors are from the United States. We believe that it is recognized that United States modular technology is more advanced than our Chinese counterparts, and the technology is recognized as the gold standard. The construction industry in China, as a whole, has a mandate to immediately start developing modular technology with cities and provinces developing modular construction plans and targets to construct modular in both the public as well as private sectors. Most communities have milestones and are creating official policies on modular construction with the actual percentage of production mandated by particular target dates.
 
We have been sought out by three separate governments in China to assist their communities in developing their modular industry based upon United States’ technology. We have experience in the construction sector in China and the United States, and thus we believe we have the leverage in assembling experts in the modular industry to assist in delivery of goods, services, equipment, technology, and know-how all under the moniker of “Made in the USA.”
 
We are currently evaluating a physical location for our operations in China along with a manufacturing facility. Our principal executive offices are located at 4700 Homewood Court, Suite 100 in Raleigh, North Carolina. We are registered as a foreign business entity in the State of North Carolina. We lease the office space from Yilaime Corporation, a Nevada corporation doing business in North Carolina, and a related party to the Company.

The Company was incorporated on January 2, 1969 as United Gold & Silver Co. (“UGS”). On February 17, 1971, UGS merged with Lucky Irish Silver, Inc., a Montana corporation, and Deep Creek Mines, Inc., a Washington corporation, in which the surviving entity’s name remained USG. On November 29, 1999, USG merged with Auto America, Inc., (“Auto America”), a Delaware corporation, through the filing of Articles of Merger resulting in the surviving entity changing its name from USG to Auto America. From 2002 to 2007, the State of Washington automatically filed numerous Certificates of Administrative Dissolutions for Auto America for failure to file annual reports. On May 14, 2007, Auto America filed its final Application of Reinstatement resulting in restoring the Company to good standing. Also, on May 14, 2007, Auto America filed Amended Articles of Incorporation changing its name to Charter Equities, Inc. (“Charter Equities”). Charter Equities converted to an Arizona corporation on January 23, 2008. Shortly thereafter, the Company converted to Nevada corporation and changed its name to Global Recycle Energy, Inc. We amended our articles of incorporation on June 27, 2016, changing our name to ATI Modular Technology Corp.
 
Mr. Alton Perkins (“Mr. Perkins”) is the control person of Yilaime Corporation, AmericaTowne and AXP Holding Corporation. At this time, the purpose of the Company is to service the construction and related technology needs of the Company, and AmericaTowne under AmericaTowne’s agreements with the Shexian County Investment Promotion Bureau in developing an AmericaTowne community in the Hanwang mountains in Shexian, China. The Company also intends on supporting these services in other AmericaTowne ventures at the invitation of the Xiamen Longyan City Chamber of Commerce, Xiamen/Longyan China and the Xiamen City Growth Planning Agency in developing an AmericaTowne Community and an International School in Longyan County China.
 
The related export services rendered to the Company in the implementation of its business plan cannot be provided by AmericaTowne or through the AmericaTowne relationship. In order to avoid conflicts of interest, Mr. Perkins is of the opinion that there must be a separate and distinct agreement between, in this case, the Company and AXP Holding Corporation. Furthermore, although other similar IC-DISC entities exist, the Company is able to obtain better terms and conditions from AXP Holding Corporation in light of Mr. Perkins’ control of AXP Holding Corporation.
 
AmericaTowne’s Board of Directors determined that operating and controlling a separate but related entity focused on the development and the exporting of modular energy efficient technology and processes for government and private enterprises in China would be more prudent from a risk mitigation and operational standpoint than providing these services under the AmericaTowne business plan. Furthermore, the intent of the Company is to expand its services and relationships to other similar endeavors in projects not related to AmericaTowne, thus the need to maintain and operate a separate entity.

Business Developments in Fiscal Year 2016
 
On June 21, 2016, AmericaTowne, the controlling shareholder of the Company by virtue of its majority ownership of common stock in the Company, entered into a Cooperative Agreement with the Shexian County Investment Promotion Bureau (the “Shexian County Bureau”) out of Shexian, China (hereinafter, the “AT/Shexian Cooperative Agreement”). The AT/Shexian Cooperative Agreement relates to the construction of an AmericaTowne location in advancing tourism in the Hanwang mountains.
 
Under the terms of the AT/Shexian Cooperative Agreement, AmericaTowne and the Shexian County Bureau have agreed to a strategic partnership wherein the Shexian County Bureau intends to invest local resources to AmericaTowne for construction of an AmericaTowne community. In consideration, AmericaTowne intends on investing funds towards the development of the AmericaTowne community. AmericaTowne will be obligated to bear any and all applicable taxes and the projected investment by AmericaTowne into the development of the AmericaTowne community is estimated to be $30,000,000. It is anticipated that the definitive agreement will set forth a detailed projection and proforma associated with the use of funds. There is no guarantee that AmericaTowne will be able to raise this capital in the event a definitive agreement is executed. Furthermore, AmericaTowne’s ability to raise the necessary capital and to perform obligations under any definitive agreement might be materially affected in the event the Company is not able to perform any of its obligations under any future definitive agreement with the Shexian County Bureau.
 
The Company is controlled by AmericaTowne by virtue of the AmericaTowne’s majority ownership of common stock. On June 21, 2016, the Company agreed to participate with the Shexian County Bureau in building local modular construction, researching technology and intelligent systems related thereto, and servicing the full lifecycle of modular construction in the locale through the execution of the Cooperative Agreement (the “ATI Modular/Shexian Cooperative Agreement”).
 
Pursuant to future negotiations and more definitive agreements, ATI Modular has agreed to purchase the requisite equipment and technology in performing under the ATI Modular/Shexian Cooperative Agreement. In consideration for the services provided by ATI Modular, the Shexian County Bureau has agreed to be responsible for providing factories and land, and other resources and manpower in developing the modular construction. The Company has also agreed to exercise its best efforts in raising approximately $30,000,000 in furthering the parties’ collective interests under the ATI Modular/Shexian Cooperative Agreement. These funds would be allocated towards different operating costs than the funds necessary for AmericaTowne to perform under the AT/Shexian Cooperative Agreement. It is anticipated that the definitive agreement will set forth a detailed projection and proforma associated with the use of funds. The Company and the Shexian County Bureau have agreed to continue to cooperate in good faith in executing and further agreements needed in furthering their respective objectives. However, notwithstanding this intent, the Company’s ability to perform might be materially affected in the event AmericaTowne is not able to meet its obligations in furthering any future definitive agreement with the Shexian County Bureau.
 
On September 8, 2016, the Company entered into the Investment and Cooperation Agreement for ATI Modular Green Building Manufacturing Project with the Jiangnan Industry Zone in Anhui Province (the “Jiangnan Agreement”). Under the Jiangnan Agreement, the Company has agreed to manufacture and install modular buildings, and provide research into the development of green building module manufacturing. The Company has agreed to provide appropriate technology and intelligent systems in providing modular building lifecycle services. The location of the planned project is the New Material Industry Park in the Jiangnan Industry Zone in Anhui Province. The parties have projected a cost of $30,000,000.

On December 28, 2016, the Company entered into the American ATI Modular Technology Company Project Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”), definitive agreement and supersedes the Jiangnan Cooperation Agreement of September 8, 2016. Under the Investment Agreement, the Administrative Committee of Jiangnan Industrial Concentration Zone of Anhui Province (hereinafter, “Jiangnan”) and the Company have agreed to the construction of the Company’s green, modular building and related technology under the project name “Modular Plant Production Base.”
 
The capitalization under the Investment Agreement is, in part, the Company’s responsibility. However, the Company and Jiangnan have agreed to certain provisions to mitigate against financing risks, including, but not limited to: (a) access upon request by the Company to local bank loans in the Anhui Province and United States Exim Bank, (b) equity fund insertion up to $3,000,000 USD, and (c) contribution by Jiangnan up to $2,900,000 upon meeting conditions in the Investment Agreement.
 
On September 9, 2016, the Company entered into the Investment and Cooperation Agreement for ATI Modular Green Building Manufacturing Project with the Yongan government in the Fujian province (the “Yongan Agreement”). Under the Yongan Agreement, similar to the Jiangnan Agreement, the Company has agreed to manufacture and install modular buildings, and provide research into the development of green building module manufacturing. The Company has agreed to provide appropriate technology and intelligent systems in providing modular building lifecycle services. The location of the planned project is Yongan city in the Fujian province, China. The parties have projected a cost of $30,000,000.
 
The Company has agreed to grant the Yongan government audit, access, supervision, inspection and other rights. The Yongan government has agreed to coordinate any and all necessary services in securing benefits associated with the Company being a foreign investment enterprise, including but not limited to, providing the site for the manufacturing facility, tax relief, access to financing and a “Project Headquarter” for the Company, which is defined in the Yongan Agreement. The Yongan Agreement is not a definitive agreement; rather, it is a memorialization of the parties’ future intent as to the subject matter therein. The Company’s business plans and objectives could be impaired in the event the parties do not reach a definitive agreement. . The Company is responsible for financing and providing any necessary facilities inside any factory plant. There is no guarantee that the Company can secure such financing or develop the necessary facilities.
 
On June 27, 2016, we entered into a Sales and Support Services Agreement with Yilaime Corporation, a Nevada corporation (“Yilaime”). Yilaime is controlled by Mr. Perkins, who is our sole director and officer. Yilaime holds the majority of issued and outstanding shares of common stock in AmericaTowne, Inc. (“ATI”), a Delaware corporation and fully-reporting company with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Under the Services Agreement, Yilaime will provide the Company with marketing, sales and support services in the Company’s pursuit of ATI Modular business in China in consideration of a commission equal to 10% of the gross amount of monies procured for the Company through Yilaime’s services. In consideration of the right to receive this commission, Yilaime has agreed to pay the Company a quarterly fee of $250,000 starting on July 1, 2016. The Services Agreement is set to expire on June 10, 2020, absent early termination for breach thereof by either party. Yilaime retains an option to extend the term under its sole discretion until June 10, 2025 by providing written notice to the Company by March 10, 2019. Yilaime has agreed to be the Company’s exclusive independent contractor in providing the services in the Services Agreement, and has agreed to a non-compete and non-circumvent agreement. Yilaime is obligated to provide support services only in a manner that is deemed commercially acceptable by Yilaime and Yilaime has the sole right to determine the means, manner and method by which services will be provided and at the time and location of its choosing. Furthermore, as the control person of Yilaime, Mr. Perkins might make decisions he deems are in the best interests of Yilaime, which might be to the detriment of the goals and objectives of the Company.

On June 28, 2016, we entered into a Modular Construction & Technology Services Agreement (the “Modular Services Agreement”) with AmericaTowne Inc. (“ATI”), a Delaware corporation and fully-reporting company with the SEC. The impetus behind the Modular Services Agreement was the Company’s Cooperative Agreement with the Shexian County Government, China. Under the Cooperative Agreement, ATI and the Shexian County Bureau have agreed to a partnership in furthering the development of an AmericaTowne community in the Hanwang mountains, Shexian, China. In addition, ATI, at the invitation of the Xiamen Longyan City Chamber of Commerce, Xiamen/Longyan China and the Xiamen City Growth Planning Agency plan to pursue the development of an AmericaTowne Community and an International School in Longyan County China.
 
Under the Modular Services Agreement, ATI Modular shall provide the research, development, training and modular technology in a manner deemed commercially acceptable by ATI based on its commercially reasonable requirements, plans and specifications, which shall be agreed upon in advance of any substantial and material construction. ATI will pay the Company a quarterly fee of $125,000 per quarter. The initial fee under the Modular Services Agreement with AmericaTowne was recorded as a related-party receivable upon its execution. The Services Agreement is set to expire on June 10, 2020, absent early termination for breach thereof by either party. ATI retains an option to extend the term under its sole discretion until June 10, 2025 by providing written notice to the Company by March 10, 2019. Yilaime has agreed to be the Company’s exclusive independent contractor in providing the services in the Services Agreement, and has agreed to a non-compete and non-circumvent agreement.
 
 On June 29, 2016, we entered into an IC-DISC Service Provider Agreement with AXP Holding Corporation, a Nevada corporation (“AXP Holding”) and related party to the Company through Mr. Perkins control of AXP Holding. AXP Holding is an Interest Charge - Domestic International Sales Corporation, or “IC-DISC”. AXP IC-DISC tax-exempt status was authorized and approved by the United States Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service. As an IC-DISC, AXP Holding may, under certain conditions, act as a sister corporation to entities and provide services to assist a company in obtaining lower tax rates on export income. In addition to the export tax savings provided by AXP, AXP can provide an additional array of services including promoting the Company’s export activities, purchasing receivables from the Company at a discount through a factoring relationship, and providing the Company with working capital loans.
 
The term under the IC-DISC Service Provider Agreement is set to expire on December 6, 2019, absent early termination for breach thereof by either party. AXP retains the right to extend the term, exercising its sole discretion, to December 6, 2024 by providing written notice to the Company by November 6, 2019. AXP has agreed to a non-compete and non-circumvent in providing the services under the IC-DISC Service Provider Agreement. The Company has agreed to pay AXP a commission fee up to the greater of 50% of the Company’s export net income or 4% of the Company’s export gross receipts. The Company will determine the exact amount and the method of payment of the commission fee. The commission fee shall be paid at the option of the Company periodically throughout the year, but no later than December 31 on annual basis. If there is no commission fee due to no export sales, the Company will pay AXP an export service fee of $50,000. The export service fee, if any, is due on or before December 31 on an annual basis.

In addition, for referring businesses from the Company’s “Export Platform” or “Community,” AXP agrees to pay the Company 25% of each “Sales Export Service Fee” charged and received as an “IC-DISC Commission” from each Exporter or Licensee resulting from participating in the Export Platform or Community. This fee is called a “Group Export Consulting Fee” in the IC-DISC Service Provider Agreement, and is due no later than fifteen business days after receipt from the Exporter or Licensee, but no later than December 31 on an annual basis. For illustrative purposes, if AXP receives and or charges an Exporter 50% of its net export sales as a commission, and that value is $100,000, AXP would owe the Company 25%, or $25,000. Furthermore, during the term, the Company shall pay AXP a flat fee of $5,000 per transaction for purchasing receivables from the Company, plus an interest rate for such factoring at the prime rate plus one-percent.
 
The Company is in the early stages of its operations, and many of its plans and objectives are aspirational in nature, and thus might never come to fruition. At this time, the Company plans to retain engineering and architectural firms based in the United States who have extensive experience in developing modular structures in the United States, China and other foreign locations based on market demand, which has not been thoroughly researched to date. The Company has been focused on obtaining quotes, negotiating formal engagements and researching all aspects of the modular construction industry. While the infrastructure is still in the developmental stage, the Company is confident that it has the experience, or access to those with experience, in the modular construction field.
 
The Company plans on engaging in onsite placement and delivery of modular structures. Mr. Perkins has extensive experience in operating business in China. One of the reasons that Mr. Perkins was sought out and invited to participate in developing the modular industry in China is that he was the co-chairman of a construction company in China - Yilaime Foreign Partnership in Henghsui China. His experience with Yilaime Foreign Partnership allows ATI Modular to call on local companies in China as well as modular companies and experts in the United States to help provide on-site services. Yilaime Foreign Partnership is not a related party to the Company, ATI, Yilaime or AXP.
 
In addition, the Company recently joined the Modular Building Institute in Charlottesville, Virginia. In September of 2016, Mr. Perkins attended the Institute’s annual exposition in order to line up available suppliers, and experts in the modular construction field.
 
We intend on offering support services in all phases of modular construction. Our approach will be to focus on exporting United States based technology, services and equipment, and general “know-how.” Exporters in our related company, AmericaTowne, are experienced in the modular field and we plan on allowing those experienced exporters to participate in various levels of our program.
 
The Company currently does not have a principal supplier of raw materials. The Company has identified potential sources of raw materials in the United States through its membership in the Modular Building Institute. One of our primary challenges will be pricing the source of raw materials and delivery to China. We are also looking to potential raw material sources in China.
 
To operate within China, the Company requires approval of government officials in China. In both cases where the Company has signed Cooperative or Definitive Agreements (and in the case of the Shexian Agreement), and at the invitation of the local government, we have the approval to register and conduct business.
