     ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
     Introduction
     Almost Family, Inc. TM and subsidiaries (collectively “Almost Family” or the “Company”) is a leading provider of cost efficient, high quality home healthcare services and related innovations to drive savings for payors and improve patient outcomes and experience.  Our Company, founded in 1976, operates over 330 locations across 26 states.      LHC Group, Inc. and Almost Family, Inc. Merger
     On November 15, 2017, our Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with LHC Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“LHC Group”), and Hammer Merger Sub, Inc., a newly-formed Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of LHC Group (“Merger Sub”), providing for a “merger of equals” business combination of our Company and LHC Group. The Merger Agreement provides that, if the conditions to the Merger are satisfied or waived and the Merger is consummated, stockholders of our Company will receive 0.9150 shares of LHC Group common stock for each share of our Company’s common stock, plus the cash equivalent of any fractional share. The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, at the closing Merger Sub will be merged with and into our Company (the “Merger”), with our Company continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of LHC Group. The parties’ obligations to complete the Merger are subject to several conditions, including, among others, (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock; (ii) the approval of the issuance of shares of LHC Group’s common stock to be issued to our stockholders in the merger by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of LHC Group’s common stock present in person or represented by proxy at LHC Group’s special meeting; (iii) the expiration or termination of the required waiting periods under the Hart-Scott Rodino Act (which occurred on February 21, 2018); (iv) the absence of any order or law prohibiting the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (v) the receipt of certain tax opinions; and (vi) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to either LHC Group or our Company (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
     The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both our Company and LHC Group, including if the Merger is not consummated on or before July 1, 2018 (subject to extension to October 1, 2018 in certain circumstances) and if the required approval of the stockholders of either our Company or LHC Group is not obtained. The Merger Agreement further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including the termination of the Merger Agreement by our Company or LHC Group as a result of an adverse change in the recommendation of the other party’s board of directors, our Company may be required to pay to LHC Group, or LHC Group may be required to pay to our Company, as applicable, a termination fee of $30 million. Further, if the Merger Agreement is terminated as a result of the stockholders of either our Company or LHC Group failing to approve the transaction, our Company may be required to reimburse to LHC Group, or LHC Group may be required to reimburse to our Company, the other party’s expenses in connection with the proposed transaction, up to a maximum of $5 million. 
     In the absence of a completed merger, we will continue to operate on a stand-alone basis.  All references within this Form 10-K assumes Almost Family, Inc. operating on a stand-alone basis.

      Website Access to Our Reports
     Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge on our website at www.almostfamily.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.  Information contained on Almost Family’s website is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated by reference in this document.     How We Are Currently Organized and Operate
     The Company has three reportable segments: a) Home Health (“HH”), b) Other Home-Based Services (“OHBS”) which includes all other home care services outside of Home Health services and c) the Healthcare Innovations (“HCI”) segment.  Reportable segments have been identified based upon how management has organized the business by services provided to customers and the criteria in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 280, Segment Reporting.  
     Our HH segment provides a comprehensive range of Medicare-certified home health nursing services to patients in need of recuperative care, typically following a period of hospitalization or care in another type of inpatient facility. Our services are often provided to patients in lieu of additional care in other settings, such as long term acute care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation hospitals or skilled nursing facilities.  Our nurses, therapists, medical social workers and home health aides work closely with patients and their families to design and implement an individualized treatment response to a physician-prescribed plan of care.  Under the umbrella of our “Senior Advocacy” mission, we offer special clinically-based protocols customized to meet the needs of the increasingly medically complex, chronic and co-morbid patient populations we serve.  Examples include Optimum Balance, Silver Steps, Cardiocare, Orthopedic and Congestive Heart Failure in the Home.  HH Medicare revenues are generated on a per episode basis rather than a fee per visit or hourly basis.  Approximately 95% of the HH segment revenues are generated from the Medicare program while the balance is generated from Medicaid and private insurance programs.
     Our OHBS segment includes traditional personal care (“PC”) services (generally provided by paraprofessional staff such as home health aides) which are generally of a custodial rather than skilled nature, as well as hospice services.  PC provides services in patients’ homes primarily on an as-needed, hourly basis.  These services include personal care, medication management, meal preparation, caregiver respite and homemaking. Our services are often provided to patients who would otherwise be admitted to skilled nursing facilities for long term custodial care.  PC revenues are generated on an hourly basis.  PC segment revenues are generated from Medicaid and other government programs while the balance is generated from insurance programs and private pay patients (approximately 80% of personal care revenues). Hospice services are largely provided in patients’ homes and generally require specialized hospice nursing skills.  Hospice revenues are generated on a per diem basis and are primarily from Medicare (approximately 93% of hospice revenues).
     Our HCI business segment is used to report on our developmental activities outside our HH and OHBS businesses. The HCI segment includes: a) an ACO enablement company; b) an in-home assessment company serving the long-term care insurance industry and managed care organizations; and c) an investment in a population-health analytics company.

     Additional financial information about our segments can be found in Part II, Item 8, “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
     Our View on Reimbursement and Diversification of Risk
     Our Company is highly dependent on government reimbursement programs which pay for the majority of the services we provide to our patients and customers.  Reimbursement under these programs, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, is subject to frequent changes as policy makers balance constituents’ needs for health care services within the constraints of the specific government’s fiscal budget.  Medicare and Medicaid, respectively, are consuming a greater percentage of federal and states’ budgets, which is exacerbated in times of economic downturn.  We believe that these financial issues are cyclical in nature rather than indicative of the long-term prospect for Medicare and Medicaid funding of health care services.  Additionally, we believe our services offer the lowest cost alternative to institutional care and are a part of the solution to the federal government’s Medicare and states’ Medicaid financing problems.
     We believe that an important key to our historical success and to our future success is our ability to adapt our operations to meet changes in reimbursement as they occur.  One important way in which we have achieved this adaptability in the past, and in which we plan to achieve it in the future, is to maintain some level of diversification in our business mix.
     The execution of our business plan will place primary emphasis on the development of our home health operations.  As our business grows, we may evaluate opportunities for the provision of other health care services in patients’ homes that would be consistent with our Senior Advocacy mission.

      The increase in branch locations in 2017 was largely the result of the acquisition of an 80% controlling interest in the entity holding the home health and hospice assets of Community Health Systems, Inc. (NYSE: CYH) (referred to herein as “CHS Home Health”).  CHS Home Health, a provider of skilled home health and hospice services, operated 74 home health and 15 hospice branch locations in 22 states.  
     Home Health Services Segment
     Our HH segment provides a comprehensive range of Medicare-certified home health nursing services to patients in need of recuperative health care, typically following a period of hospitalization or care in another type of inpatient facility.  Our patients are referred to us by their physicians or upon discharge from a hospital or other type of in-patient facility. 

 
  7

 
Our HH segment operates 242 Medicare-certified home health agencies. This segment generated 74% of our revenues for 2017, of which approximately 95% were derived from the Medicare program.  
     We receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies.  Our professional staff includes registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, physical, speech and occupational therapists, and medical social workers.  They fulfill medical treatment plans prescribed by physicians.  Our professional staff are subject to state licensing requirements in the particular states in which they practice.  Para-professional staff members (primarily home health aides) also provide care to these patients.
     Our HH segment operations located in Florida normally experience higher admissions during the first quarter and lower admissions during the third quarter than in the other quarters due to seasonal population fluctuations.  HH segment operations located in Florida generated approximately 20% of our revenue for 2017.  
     Other Home-Based Services Segment
     Personal care services are also provided in patients’ homes on an as needed hourly basis, including personal care, medication management, meal preparation, caregiver respite and homemaking.  These services (generally provided by para-professional staff such as home health aides) are generally of a custodial rather than skilled nature.  Generally, PC revenues are generated on an hourly basis, of which approximately 80% were derived from the Medicaid program.  We currently operate 75 Personal Care locations.  Hospice services are largely provided in patients’ homes and generally require specialized hospice nursing skills.  Hospice revenues are generated on a per diem basis and are primarily from Medicare (approximately 93% of hospice revenues). We operate 16 Hospice locations.  Our OHBS segment generated 23% of our revenues for 2017.       Healthcare Innovations Segment
     Our HCI business segment was created to house and separately report on our developmental activities outside our traditional home health business platform.  These activities are intended ultimately, whether directly or indirectly, to benefit our patients and payers through the enhanced provision of home health services.  HCI activities all share a common goal of improving patient experiences and quality outcomes, while lowering costs.  These include, but are not limited to: technology, information, population health management, risk-sharing, assessments, care coordination and transitions, clinical advancements, enhanced patient engagement and informed clinical decision making.  We believe these activities help us discover valuable insight and experiences that would not otherwise be gained in the routine operation of our core home health business segments.  Further, we believe these innovation activities will play an important role in collaborating with policy makers, payers, providers, and anyone who assumes financial risk for managing patient populations, to seek to reduce costs, and improve quality by providing increasingly more care for more patients in their homes than ever before.  This segment generated approximately 3% of our revenue for 2017.  
 As discussed further below, the HCI segment currently includes: a) Imperium Health Management, LLC ("Imperium"), an ACO enablement company, b) Long Term Solutions, Inc. ("LTS"), an in-home assessment company serving the long-term care insurance industry, c) Ingenios Health Co. ("Ingenios"), a Nurse-Practitioner-oriented and mobile technology-enabled health risk assessment company primarily serving managed care organizations; and d) an investment in Care Journey (formerly NavHealth, Inc.), a population-health analytics company, 
 Some of these initiatives are highly speculative and have been made in development stage enterprises.  There can be no assurance that we will receive any return on, or of, the capital we invest in these ventures.  However, we believe these activities already have, and will continue to help us, discover valuable insights and experiences we would not otherwise gain in the routine operation of our core home health business segments.  These endeavors are part of a growing number of care-related innovations and reforms.  We expect more will be attempted over the next several years.
     Imperium
 Imperium's purpose is to assist health care systems and independent primary care physician practices in establishing and successfully operating Accountable Care Organizations ("ACOs") first made possible by 2010's Affordable Care Act.  

 
  8

 
Through improved care management, in a coordinated effort led by primary care physicians, with nurses and home health agencies using evidence-based clinical standards, we seek to reduce avoidable hospitalizations, emergent care, and non-impactful health care services.  We seek to work together with primary care physicians to manage high-cost patients in lower-cost settings, with a goal of generating, and sharing in, savings to the Medicare program.  By linking physicians with home health care through the ACO vehicle we seek to deliver meaningful savings to the healthcare system and participate in a share of those savings under the Medicare Shared Savings Program ("MSSP") and such other similar models as may evolve in the future.
 Imperium has rapidly expanded its customer base growing from 3 ACOs under contract in 2013, to 7 in 2014, 11 in 2015, 14 in 2016, 15 in 2017 and 30 in 2018.  In terms of covered Medicare beneficiaries, Imperium has grown from 23,000 in 2013, to 45,000 in 2014 and 85,000 in 2015, 124,000 in 2016, 142,000 in 2017 and 405,000 in 2018.  While we intend to work together toward the development of additional ACO relationships in markets in which Almost Family also provides home health services, Imperium also currently has, and will continue to seek, ACO customers in other service territories.  We own 72% of Imperium and consolidate its result in our financial statements.  We report a provision for noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) to reflect the income or losses attributable to the 28% interest that we do not own.  
 CMS announced the first year financial reconciliation and quality performance results for ACOs in September of 2014, in which, fifty-three ACOs generated shared savings during their first performance year ended December 31, 2013.  ACOs that generated savings earned a performance payment, if they met the quality standard.  CMS announced the fourth year results in August of 2017.  Imperium serviced ACOs have received an MSSP payments in the first, second, third and fourth CMS results.  Imperium received its share of $2.3 million in 2017 for 2016 services, $4.3 million in 2016 for 2015 services, $1.4 million in 2015 for 2014 services and $1.6 million in 2014 for 2013 services.  There can be no assurance that future payments will be made by CMS, the structure of MSSP payments will remain as currently deployed, or that an MSSP payment will be received in 2018 related to our 2017 services or any future period.
 Long Term Solutions
 LTS performs in-home nursing assessments for the long-term care insurance industry. LTS also provides a suite of planning and support services to insurance companies, employers and direct to individuals and families throughout the United States. LTS, through its network of thousands of assessment service partners provides assessments in all 50 U.S. states and a number of foreign countries. LTS estimates that the majority of its assessments result in the patient ultimately receiving home health, assisted living or skilled nursing care in accordance with their long-term care insurance benefits.     Ingenios Health Co.
     Ingenios is a provider of technology enabled in-home clinical assessments for Medicare Advantage, Managed Medicaid and Commercial Exchange lives.  We believe health assessment capabilities provide the key element in the evolution of improved care planning and delivery as healthcare delivery and reimbursement models evolve.
     Care Journey (formerly NavHealth)
     Care Journey is a development-stage enterprise whose business plan is focused on the development of technology-based tools designed to help health systems anticipate and inform a patient’s journey through the health care system.  Among its other objectives, Care Journey seeks to develop and market a software platform designed to assist health care providers, managed care organizations and insurers in their efforts to aggregate patient data from various sources, improve patient engagement, satisfaction and outcomes and lower the overall cost of healthcare delivery.  We are co-invested with founders Aneesh Chopra and Hunch Analytics which Chopra co-founded with Sanju Bansal.  Mr. Bansal is the co-founder and former COO of MicroStrategy (MSTR), a worldwide provider of enterprise software for cloud business intelligence and big data services.  We made an initial $1 million noncontrolling investment in Care Journey on January 29, 2015 and may, at our option, invest another $1 million.  We account for this non-controlling investment under the cost method.

 Compensation for Home Health Services
     We are compensated for our home health services by (i) Medicare, (ii) Medicaid, (iii) other third party payors (e.g., insurance companies and other sources), and (iv) private pay (paid by personal funds).  The rates of reimbursement we receive from Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs are generally dictated by those programs.  In determining charge rates for goods and services provided to our other customers, we evaluate several factors including cost and market competition.  We sometimes negotiate contract rates with third party providers such as insurance companies.
     Our reliance on government sponsored reimbursement programs makes us vulnerable to possible legislative and administrative regulation changes and budget cut-backs that could adversely affect the number of persons eligible for such programs, the amount of allowed reimbursements or other aspects of the programs, any of which could materially affect us.  In addition, loss of certification or qualification under Medicare or Medicaid programs could materially affect our ability to effectively market our services.
     The following table sets forth our revenues from operations derived from each major payor class during the indicated periods (by percentage of net revenues) for the following years:
    
Payor Group | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | 
Medicare | 75.1 | % | 68.2 | % | 71.4 | %
Medicaid and Other Government Programs | 19.8 | % | 23.2 | % | 22.5 | %
Insurance and private pay | 5.1 | % | 8.6 | % | 6.1 | %

      Medicare revenues account for 95% of HH segment revenues.  Historical changes in payment sources are primarily a result of changes in the types of customers we attract.
     See “Government Regulation” and “Risk Factors.”  We will monitor the effects of such items and may consider modifications to our expansion and development strategy when and if necessary.
     Acquisitions
     The Company has completed several acquisitions over the past few years and will continue to seek to acquire other quality providers of Medicare-certified home health and/or personal care services, along with making investments in healthcare innovators through our Healthcare Innovations segment.
     Factors which may affect future acquisition decisions include, but are not limited to, the quality and potential profitability of the business under consideration, and our profitability and ability to finance the transaction.
     2017 Acquisitions
 On November 20, 2017, our CHS-JV purchased assets of a Medicare-certified home health agency in Fort Myers, Florida.  Post-acquisition operating results are reported in our HH segment.
     On July 14, 2017, our CHS-JV purchased assets of a Medicare-certified home health agency and related private duty company in Key West, Florida.  Post-acquisition operating results are reported in our HH and OHBS segments. 
     On December 31, 2016, the first day of our 2017 fiscal year, we acquired an 80% controlling interest in the entity holding the home health and hospice assets of Community Health Systems, Inc. (NYSE: CYH) (referred to herein as “CHS Home Health”).  CHS Home Health, a provider of skilled home health and hospice services, operated 74 home health and 15 hospice branch locations in 22 states.  The purchase price of $128 million was funded through borrowings on the Company’s revolving credit facility.  
     2016 Acquisitions

     On June 18, 2016, we acquired certain home health agency assets primarily in Wisconsin, but also in Connecticut and Kentucky (collectively, the Wisconsin acquisition) for a purchase price of $6.1 million, funded through borrowings on the Company’s bank credit facility.  The post-acquisition operating results of these agencies are primarily reported in our PC segment. 
     On January 5, 2016, we acquired 100% of the equity of LTS for a purchase price of $37 million, funded through borrowings on the Company's bank credit facility, seller notes and issuance of the Company's common stock.  LTS's post acquisition operating results are reported in our HCI segment.
     On January 5, 2016, we purchased the assets of a Medicare-certified home health agency owned by Bayonne Visiting Nurse Association (“Bayonne”) located in New Jersey.  Bayonne’s post acquisition operating results are reported in our HH segment.
     2015 Acquisitions
 On November 5, 2015, we acquired the stock of Black Stone Operations, LLC (“Black Stone”).  Black Stone is a provider of in-home personal care and skilled home health services in western Ohio and operates under the name “Home Care by Black Stone.”  The purchase price of $40 million was funded through borrowings on the Company’s bank credit facility, seller notes and issuance of the Company’s common stock.  Black Stone’s post acquisition operating results are reported in our HH and PC segments.
     On July 22, 2015, we acquired 100% of the equity of Ingenios for approximately $11.4 million of the Company’s common stock plus $2 million in cash.  Ingenios is a leading provider of technology enabled in-home clinical assessments for Medicare Advantage, Managed Medicaid and Commercial Exchange lives in four states and Washington, D.C.  The post acquisition operating results of Ingenios are reported in our HCI segment.
     On August 29, 2015, we acquired 100% of the equity of Bracor, Inc. (dba “WillCare”).  WillCare, based in Buffalo, NY, owned and operated HH and PC branch locations in New York (12) and Connecticut (1).  The purchase price was approximately $50.8 million.  The transaction was funded by borrowings under the Company’s bank credit facility.  WillCare’s New York and Connecticut post acquisition operating results are reported in our HH and PC segments.
     On March 1, 2015, we acquired the stock of WillCare’s Ohio operations for $3.0 million.  WillCare’s Ohio post acquisition operating results are reported in our HH and PC segments.
     On January 29, 2015, we acquired a noncontrolling interest in a development stage analytics and software company, Care Journey.  The investment is an asset of our Healthcare Innovations segment.
     Competition, Marketing and Customers
     The home health industry is highly competitive and fragmented.  Competitors include larger publicly held companies such as Amedisys, Inc. (NasdaqGS: AMED), Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: KND), and LHC Group, Inc. (NasdaqGS: LHCG), and numerous privately held multi-site home care companies, privately held single-site agencies and a significant number of hospital-based agencies. Competition for customers at the local market level is very fragmented and market specific.  Generally, each local market has its own competitive profile and no one competitor has significant market share across all our markets.  To the best of our knowledge, no individual provider has more than 7% share of the national Medicare home health market.
     We believe the primary competitive factors are quality of service and reputation among referral sources.  We market our services through our site managers and marketing staff.  These individuals contact referral sources in their areas to market our services.  Major referral sources include: physicians, hospital discharge planners, Offices on Aging, social workers, and group living facilities.  We also utilize, to a lesser degree, consumer-direct sales, marketing and advertising programs designed to attract customers.
    
 
  11

 

 The personal care and hospice industries are likewise highly competitive and fragmented.  Competitors include home health providers, senior adult associations, and the private hiring of caregivers.  We market our services primarily through our site managers, and we compete by offering a high quality of care and by helping families identify and access solutions for care.  Major referral sources include case managers, physicians and hospital discharge planners.
     Our HCI segment competes in new industries, some of which were created by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”), signed into law in 2010.  In certain cases, we operate in relatively new and unproven markets which include new competitors that are identified regularly and which range in size from start-up companies to larger publicly held companies like Universal American Corp., now owned by WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (NYSE: WCG).  We market our services directly to our customers.
     Government Regulation
     Medicare Home Health Program
     Payment Methodology
     As shown in “Compensation for Home Health Services” above, approximately 75% of our 2017 consolidated net service revenues were derived from the Medicare Home Health Program.  Medicare reimburses home health care providers under the Prospective Payment System (“PPS”), which pays a fixed, predetermined rate for services and supplies under an episode of care.  An episode of home health care spans a 60-day period, starting with the first day a billable visit is furnished to a Medicare beneficiary and ending 60 days later.  If a patient is still in treatment on the 60th day, a new episode begins on the 61st day, commonly referred to as a recertification episode, regardless of whether a billable visit is rendered on that day and ends 60 days later.
     Payment rates are subject to adjustment based on certain variables including, but not limited to: (a) a case-mix adjustment, which drives the home health resource group (“HHRG”) to which the Medicare patient is assigned based on such factors as the patient’s clinical, functional, and services utilization characteristics; (b) geographic wage adjustment, including rural rate add-ons, if any; (c) a payment adjustment based upon the level of therapy services required (thresholds set at 6, 14 and 20 visits); (d) a low utilization payment adjustment (“LUPA”) if the number of visits was fewer than five; (e) an outlier payment if our patient’s care was unusually costly (capped at 10% of total reimbursement at the agency level); (f) a partial payment if our patient transferred to another provider or we received a patient from another provider before completing the episode; (g) the number of episodes of care provided to a patient; and (h) sequestration, a 2% legislated reduction pursuant to the Budget Control Act (“BCA”) signed into law on August 2, 2011, which was effective for episodes ended after March 31, 2013.
     In establishing payment rates for the last three years, the Medicare Program recalibrated the national average case-mix levels and maintained budget neutrality by making a corresponding adjustment to the National, Standardized 60-Day Episode Payment Rate (“Base Episode Payment Rate”).  These nominal case-mix and payment rate recalibrations result in a lower case mix and higher base rates and are intended to have no effect on payments actually made.  We have presented the Base Episode Payment Rate established by the Medicare Program for all episodes of care ended on or after the applicable time periods, along with the Base Episode Payment Rate for each period as if the case-mix resets were in effect for all prior periods below:

 | | | Base Episode Payment Rate | 
 | Base Episode | | Adjusted for Case-mix | 
Period | Payment Rate (1) | | Recalibrations (2) | 
January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 | $ | 3,040 | | $ | 3,040
January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 | | 2,990 | | | 3,038
January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 | | 2,965 | | | 3,077
January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 | | 2,961 | | | 3,130

As applicable, adjusted payment rates for each of the years 2015-2017 were calculated by multiplying the actual Base Episode Payment by 1.0187 (2015 Final Rule), then by 1.0214 (2016 Final Rule) and then by 1.0160 (2017 Final Rule).

      After determining the appropriate PPS payment rate, we record net revenues as services are rendered to patients over the 60-day episode period.  At the end of each month, a portion of our revenue is estimated for episodes that have not yet been completed, which are generally referred to as episodes in progress.  As a result, net service revenues recorded for an episode in progress is subject to change if the actual number of visits differs from the number anticipated at the start of care.  Our revenue recognition under the Medicare reimbursement program is discussed in greater detail in Part II, Item 7 “Critical Accounting Policies” and Item 8, “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”.
     2018 CMS Related Updates
     The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, enacted in February 2018 has the following provisions impacting health care services provided at home:

· | Restores the 3% home health rate add-on for patients who reside in rural geographies, effective January 1, 2018. The add-on rate will be phased downward over a five year period following a formula specified in the legislation. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Mandates the development of a new case mix model for home health services using a 30 day payment period, through a transparent process including the home health industry and Congressional committees of Medicare jurisdiction. The law requires any new case mix model to be implemented in 2020 in a budget neutral manner. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Face-to-face documentation improvements allowing the home health medical record in its entirety to be used to support the physician’s attestation of medical necessity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A study to be conducted by the GAO (Government Accounting Office) on Medicare improvements to address the needs of the chronically ill including the provision of services provided at home, including interdisciplinary care management, tele-health and tele-monitoring for managed care plans, requiring states to better integrate Medicare and Medicaid services for the dually eligible and extension of the Independence at Home Demonstration Program.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A specific home health market basket annual inflationary update percentage of 1.5% for FY2020, leaving intact the full market basket update (generally expected to be between 2% and 3%) for FY2019.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  On November 1, 2017, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) released the final rule for FY2018 home health reimbursement, which includes a 0.4% rate cut consisting of a 1.0% market basket update, a 0.97% case mix adjustment and sunset of the rural add-on provision.  Among other things, the rule finalizes proposals for the Home Health Value Based Purchasing (“HHVBP”) Model and the Home Health Quality Reporting Program (“HH QRP”).  CMS did not finalize the Home Health Groupings Model but instead elected to “further engage with stakeholders to move towards a system that shifts the focus from volume of services to a more patient –centered model”.  On September 25, 2017, the Company submitted a comment letter to CMS which provides an alternative course of action that we believe better protects Medicare beneficiaries and their right to access appropriate and necessary home health service.  The comment letter to CMS entitled “CY 2018 Home Health Prospective Payment System Rate Update – September 2017” can be found on the Company’s website, along with a series of responses to various other stakeholder requests from the Senate Finance Committee, the House Ways and Means Committee and CMS dating to 2013 and including the Company’s executive testimony before the Congress.
     In January of 2017, CMS released a final rule revising the conditions of participation (“CoPs”) for home health agencies to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  The rule, originally effective July 13, 2017, and deferred through the end of 2017, focuses on, among other things, care delivered to patients, an interdisciplinary view of patient care, greater flexibility in meeting quality of care standards and the elimination of certain unneeded procedural burdens on providers.  This new rule is not expected to have a significant impact on our result of operations or financial position.
     On June 8, 2016, CMS announced the “Pre-Claim Review Demonstration of Home Health Services” which seeks to demonstrate that a review of selected documentation prior to payment of claims can decrease “improper payments 

 
  13

 
because of insufficient documentation.”  According to CMS, the pre-claim review demonstration was designed to help educate Home Health Agencies on what documentation is required and encourage them to submit the correct documentation, while still allowing the HHA to begin providing services and receive initial payments prior to the pre-claim review decision.  The pre-claim review demonstration began in Illinois in 2016, but currently has been suspended.  Further expansion to Florida, Texas, Michigan and Massachusetts has also been delayed.  Currently, it is unclear as to when this demonstration program will be resumed, if ever.
     Potential Future Developments in Medicare Home Health
     While there have been many changes enacted over the past several years, the Congress and/or CMS may take future actions which could have an adverse impact on our business, including possible:
· | Extension of the rebasing period to a period longer than the currently legislated 2014-2017 four-year phase in;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Changes in cost sharing between the Medicare program (“Program”) and beneficiaries (i.e., co-pays);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Removal of or changes to codes in the case-mix system or recalibration of the case-mix system including further case-mix creep coding adjustments, all of which could result in changes to rates under the national standardized 60-day episodic payment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Post-acute care bundling;
--+--------------------------


· | Removal or reductions to established statutory reductions to the annual inflationary rate adjustments we would have otherwise received;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | “Productivity” payment reductions to reimbursement rates we would have otherwise received;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Changes that put providers “at risk” for patient outcomes;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | Addition of new pre-authorization requirements for home health services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Implementation and/or expansion of Value-based pricing programs could result in reduction of reimbursement rates we would otherwise receive or could impact our reimbursement in ways we do not currently anticipate, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other types of changes of which we may not currently be aware.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

      We are unable to predict when or whether any of these types of changes may be enacted or what impact, if any, they may have on our business.
     Medicaid Reimbursement
     As shown in “Compensation for Home Health Services” above, approximately 20% of our 2017 consolidated net service revenues were derived from state Medicaid and Other Government Programs, with approximately 7.5%, 3.4%, 3.1%, 1.9% and 1.1% generated from Medicaid reimbursement programs in the states of Ohio, Connecticut, New York, Tennessee and Kentucky, respectively.  Net service revenues under such state programs are derived from services provided under a per visit, per hour or unit basis (as opposed to episodic).  Revenues are calculated and recorded using payor-specific or patient-specific fee schedules based on the contracted rates.
     The financial condition of the Medicaid programs in each of the states in which we operate is cyclical with some currently facing significant budget issues.  States may be expected from time to time to take actions or evaluate taking actions to control the rate of growth of Medicaid expenditures.  Among these actions are the following:
    
· | redefining eligibility standards for Medicaid coverage,
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | redefining coverage criteria for home and community based care services,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | slowing payments to providers by increasing the minimum time in which payments are made,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | limiting reimbursement rate increases or implementing rate cuts,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | increased utilization of self-directed care alternatives,
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | shifting beneficiaries from traditional coverage to Medicaid managed care providers, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | changing regulations under which providers must operate.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 Medicaid programs, while partially federally funded, are administered by the individual states under the broad supervision of CMS.  Accordingly, developments typically occur on a state-by-state basis.  Specific programs and changes are enacted regularly.  Any such changes, if enacted, could adversely impact our operations.
     Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement Summary
     The health care industry has experienced, and is expected to continue to experience, extensive and dynamic periods of change.  In addition to economic forces and regulatory influences, continuing political debate subjects the health care industry to significant reform.  Health care reforms have been enacted as discussed elsewhere in this document and proposals for additional changes are continuously formulated by departments of the federal government, Congress, and state legislatures.  Such governmental payors provide for approximately 95% of our consolidated net service revenues, including Medicare Advantage plans run by private insurers which are also dependent on federal funding.
     We expect legislators and government officials to continuously review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methodologies.  Changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities, the relative cost of doing business, and the methods and amounts of payments for medical care by both governmental and other payors.  We expect legislative changes intended to “balance the budget” and slow the annual rate of growth of Medicare and Medicaid to continue.  Such future changes may further impact reimbursement for our services.  There can be no assurance that future legislation or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
     Governments might take or consider taking further actions because the number of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and their related expenditures are growing at a faster rate than the governments’ revenue.  Medicare and Medicaid are consuming increasing percentages of budgets and may expand further driven by state based exchanges resulting from the ACA and implementing regulations.  Health care financing issues are exacerbated when revenues slow in a down economy.  We believe that these financing issues are cyclical in nature rather than indicative of the long-term prospect for Medicare and Medicaid funding of health care services for the populations we serve.  Additionally, we believe our services offer the lowest cost alternative to institutional care and are a critical part of the solution to our nation’s health care financing problems.
     Given the broad and far reaching implications of all the changes in the rapidly evolving environment in which we operate, the incomplete nature of these changes, the pace at which the changes are taking place and the prospects for future changes to be made, we cannot predict the ultimate impact, which may be material and adverse, that health care reform efforts and resulting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates will have on our liquidity, our results of operations, the realizability of the carrying amounts of our intangible assets, including goodwill, or our financial condition.  Further, we are unable to predict what effect, if any, such material adverse effect, if it were to occur, might have on our ability to continue to comply with the financial covenants of our revolving credit facility and our ability to continue to access debt capital through that facility.
     Permits and Licensure
     Many states require companies providing certain health care services to be licensed as home health agencies. In addition, certain health care practitioners employed by us require state licensure and/or registration and must comply with laws and regulations governing standards of practice.  The failure to obtain, renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals or licenses could adversely affect our business.  We believe we are currently licensed appropriately where required by the laws of the states in which we operate.  There can be no assurance that either the states or the federal government will not impose additional regulations upon our activities which might adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.     Certificates of Need
     Certain states require companies providing health care services to obtain a certificate of need issued by a state health-planning agency.  Where required by law, we have obtained certificates of need from those states.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any certificates of need which may be required in the future, if we expand the 

 
  15

 
scope of our services or if state laws change to impose additional certificate of need requirements, and any attempt to obtain additional certificates of need will cause us to incur certain expenses.
     Medicare and Medicaid Participation
     Effective March 25, 2011, CMS implemented new enrollment regulations which were a response to aspects of the ACA designed to enhance enrollment procedures to protect against fraud.  The regulations authorize the establishment of risk categories with risk level dictating the enrollment screening activities, i.e., more rigorous screening as the perceived risk increases.  For Medicare, there are three categories of providers i.e., “limited,” “moderate,” or “high” risk, and CMS has placed newly enrolling home health agencies in the “high risk” category, with existing enrolled home health agencies categorized as “moderate risk.”  In addition to the low risk provider screening procedures, providers in the moderate risk category will be subject to unannounced site visits. For high risk providers, any individual with a 5% or more ownership interest will be subject to fingerprint-based criminal history record checks.  Additionally, the new regulations authorize Medicare and state Medicaid agencies to impose temporary enrollment moratoria for a particular type of provider if determined to be necessary to combat fraud, waste, or abuse.  To the extent that home health agencies are subject to a moratorium, any newly enrolling home health agency, including any change of ownership subject to the 36 month rule, and any expansion to add a branch would be affected by the moratorium.     Other Regulations
     A series of laws and regulations dating back to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (“OBRA 1987”) and through the ACA and related subsequent legislation have been enacted and apply to us.  Changes in applicable laws and regulations have occurred from time to time since OBRA 1987 including reimbursement reductions and changes to payment rules.  Changes are also expected to occur continuously for the foreseeable future.
     As a provider of services under Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are subject to the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute and other “fraud and abuse laws.”  The anti-kickback statute prohibits any bribe, kickback, rebate or remuneration of any kind in return for, or as an inducement for, the referral of Medicare or Medicaid patients.  We may also be affected by the federal physician self-referral prohibition, known as the “Stark” law, which, with certain exceptions, prohibits physicians from referring patients to entities in which they have a financial interest or from which they receive financial benefit.  Penalties for violations of the federal Stark law include payment sanctions, civil monetary penalties, and/or program exclusion.  Many states in which we operate have adopted similar self-referral laws, as well as laws that prohibit certain direct or indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers, if such arrangements are designed to induce or to encourage the referral of patients to a particular provider.
     As a result of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and other legislative and administrative initiatives, federal and state enforcement efforts against the health care industry have increased dramatically, subjecting all health care providers to increased risk of scrutiny and increased compliance costs.
     We are subject to routine and periodic surveys, audits and investigations by various governmental agencies.  In addition to surveys to determine compliance with the conditions of participation, CMS has engaged a number of contractors (including Fiscal Intermediaries, Recovery Audit Contractors, Program Safeguard Contractors, Zone Program Integrity Contractors, and Medicaid Integrity Contributors) to conduct audits to evaluate billing practices and identify overpayments.  In addition to audits by CMS contractors, individual states are implementing similar programs such as using Medicaid Recovery Audit Contractors.  We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws. However, we are unable to predict what additional government regulations, if any, affecting our business may be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws and regulations might be interpreted or whether we will be able to comply with such laws and regulations either in the markets in which we presently conduct, or wish to commence, business.
     Medicare Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)
     The ACA also established ACOs as a tool to improve quality and lower costs through increased care coordination in the Medicare fee-for-service (“FFS”) program, also known as “Original Medicare.”  The Medicare FFS program covers approximately 70% of the Medicare recipients or approximately 36 million eligible Medicare beneficiaries.  ACOs are 

 
  16

 
groups of doctors and other healthcare providers working together to provide high quality services and care for their patients.  Provider and beneficiary participation in an ACO is purely voluntary and Medicare beneficiaries retain their current ability to seek treatment from any provider they wish.  ACOs are legal entities that contract with CMS for three-year periods.  Beneficiaries are assigned to ACOs using an “attribution” model based on a plurality of services provided by the primary care physician.  Beneficiaries still have the right to use any doctor or hospital who accepts Medicare, at any time.  In order to receive revenues from CMS under the MSSP, the ACO must meet certain minimum savings rates (i.e. save the federal government money) and meet certain quality measures.  More specifically, the ACOs costs of medical expenses for its members during a relevant measurement year must be below the ACO’s benchmark by a minimum amount as established by CMS for such ACO.
     CMS established the MSSP to facilitate coordination and cooperation among providers to improve the quality of care for Medicare FFS beneficiaries and reduce unnecessary costs.  Eligible providers, hospitals, and suppliers may participate in the MSSP by creating, participating in or contracting with an ACO.  The MSSP is designed to improve beneficiary outcomes and increase value of care by (1) promoting accountability for the care of Medicare FFS beneficiaries; (2) requiring coordinated care for all services provided under Medicare FFS; and (3) encouraging investment in infrastructure and redesigned care processes.  The MSSP will reward ACOs that reduce health care costs below their benchmark while also meeting performance standards on quality of care.  Under the final MSSP rules, Medicare will continue to pay individual providers and suppliers for specific items and services as it currently does under the FFS payment methodologies.  MSSP rules require CMS to develop a benchmark for savings to be achieved by each ACO, if the ACO is to receive shared savings or for ACOs that have elected to accept responsibility for losses.  An ACO that meets the program’s quality performance standards will be eligible to receive a share of the savings to the extent its assigned beneficiary medical expenditures are below its own medical expenditure benchmark provided by CMS.
     Insurance Programs and Costs
     We bear significant risk under our large-deductible workers’ compensation insurance program and our self-insured employee health program.  Under the workers’ compensation insurance program, we bear risk up to $400,000 per incident.
     We purchase stop-loss insurance for the employee health plan that places a specific limit, generally $300,000, on our exposure for any individual covered life.  The ACA also includes regulatory changes related to employer sponsored health insurance benefit plans, the most significant of which was initially effective for the Company January 1, 2015.  However, certain components continue to evolve, be delayed or have additional developments.  Management has implemented portions of its procedures and is currently working to evaluate the implications of these changes and to develop appropriate courses of action for the Company.  At this time, we are unable to predict the full impact of such changes on our health insurance benefit programs or the costs of such programs to the Company.
     Malpractice and general patient liability claims for incidents which may give rise to litigation have been asserted against us by various claimants.  The claims are in various stages of processing and some may ultimately be brought to trial.  We are aware of incidents that have occurred through December 29, 2017, that may result in the assertion of additional claims.  We currently carry professional and general liability insurance coverage (on a claims made basis) for this exposure with no deductible.
     We also carry D&O coverage for potential claims against our directors and officers, including securities actions, with deductibles ranging from $175,000 to $500,000 per claim.
     Total premiums, excluding estimated exposure to claims and deductibles, for all our non-health insurance programs were approximately $2.5 million for the contract year ended May 31, 2017.
     We record estimated liabilities for our insurance programs based on information provided by the third-party plan administrators, historical claims experience, the life cycle of claims, expected costs of claims incurred but not paid, and expected costs to settle unpaid claims.  We monitor our estimated insurance-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries on a monthly basis and have recorded amounts due under insurance policies in other current assets, while 

 
  17

 
recording the estimated carrier liability in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.  As facts change, it may become necessary to make adjustments that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.
     We believe that our present insurance coverage is adequate.  As part of our on-going risk management, regulatory compliance and cost control efforts, we continually seek alternatives that might provide a different balance of cost and risk, including potentially accepting additional self-insurance risk in lieu of higher premium costs.
     Executive Officers of the Registrant
     See Part III, Item 10 of this Form 10-K for information about the Company’s executive officers.
     Employees and Labor Relations
     As of December 29, 2017, we had approximately 17,100 employees.  None of our employees are represented by a labor organization.  We believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory.
