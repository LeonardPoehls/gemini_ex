ITEM 1.BUSINESS
General 
CatchMark Timber Trust, Inc. ("CatchMark Timber Trust") (NYSE: CTT), a Maryland corporation, is a self- administered and self-managed real estate company that invests in timberlands and has elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. CatchMark Timber Trust was incorporated in 2005, commenced operations in 2007, and conducts substantially all of its business through CatchMark Timber Operating Partnership, L.P. (“CatchMark Timber OP”), a Delaware limited partnership. CatchMark Timber Trust is the general partner of CatchMark Timber OP, possesses full legal control and authority over its operations, and owns 99.99% of its common partnership units. CatchMark LP Holder, LLC (“CatchMark LP Holder”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CatchMark Timber Trust, is the sole limited partner of CatchMark Timber OP. In addition, CatchMark Timber TRS, Inc. (“CatchMark TRS”), a Delaware corporation, was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of CatchMark Timber OP. Unless otherwise noted, references to CatchMark Timber Trust, "we", "us", or "our" herein shall include CatchMark Timber Trust and all of its subsidiaries, including CatchMark Timber OP, and the subsidiaries of CatchMark Timber OP, including CatchMark TRS.
We primarily engage in the ownership, management, acquisition, and disposition of timberland properties located in the United States. We generate recurring income and cash flows from the harvest and sale of timber, as well as from non-timber related revenue sources, such as rent from hunting and recreational leases. When and where we believe it is appropriate, we also generate income and cash flow from timberland sales.
For each of the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our revenues from timber sales, timberland sales, and non-timber related sources, as a percentage of our total revenue, are set forth in the table below: 

 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Timber sales | 80 | % | | 76 | % | 75 | %
Timberland sales | 15 | % | | 17 | % | 20 | %
Other revenues | 5 | % | | 7 | % | 5 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

In addition to current income, we expect to realize additional long-term returns from the biological growth of our standing timber inventory.
Current Timberland Holdings
As of December 31, 2016, we owned interests in approximately 499,600 acres of timberland in the U.S. South, consisting of approximately 467,500 acres held in fee-simple interests, or our fee timberlands, and approximately 32,100 acres held in leasehold interests, or our leased timberlands. As of December 31, 2016, our timberlands were comprised of approximately 74% pine stands and 26% hardwood stands (by acreage) and contained an estimated 20.3 million tons of merchantable inventory.
Please refer to Item 2 – Properties for more details on our timber and timberland properties. 
Our Business and Growth Strategies
Our objective is to produce cash flow and value growth through the ongoing implementation of the following business and growth strategies: 
1

Index to Consolidated Financial Statements

Actively Manage Our Timberlands for Long-Term Results. We seek to maximize long-term returns by actively managing our timberlands to achieve an optimum balance among biological timber growth, current harvest cash flow, and responsible environmental stewardship. Further, we expect to continue making investments in forest technology, including improved seedlings, in order to increase the sustainable yield of our timberlands over the long-term. 
Maximize Profitability on Timber Sales. We actively manage our log merchandising efforts together with delivered and stumpage sales with the goal of achieving the highest available price for our timber products. We compete with other timberland owners on the basis of the quality of our logs, the prices of our logs, our reputation as a reliable supplier and our ability to meet customer specifications. We will continue to work diligently and proactively with our third-party contractors to ensure that we optimize our logging, hauling, sorting, and merchandising operations to extract the maximum profitability from each of our logs based on the foregoing considerations. 
Pursue Attractive Timberland Acquisitions. We seek to identify and acquire high­ quality prime timberland properties, with our average deal size ranging from 10,000 to 40,000 acres. Critical evaluation of prospective property acquisitions is an essential component of our acquisition strategy. When evaluating acquisition opportunities, we assess a full range of matters relating to the prospective timberland property or properties, including, but not limited to:
•Local market dynamics;

• | Predominantly pine merchantable inventory mix;


• | Merchantable inventory mix (tons per-acre);


• | Sustainable productivity (on a tons per-acre, per-year basis);


• | Quality of existing and prospective customers; and


• | Target unlevered cash yields.

Due to the expected liquidation of the ownership positions of a number of timberland investment management organizations over the next several years, we anticipate there will be a robust supply of attractive timberlands available for sale. We may also enter into additional fiber supply agreements with respect to acquired properties in order to ensure a steady source of demand for our incremental timber production. 
Opportunistically Sell Timberland Assets. We continuously assess potential alternative uses of our timberlands, as some of our properties may be more valuable for development, conservation, recreational or other rural purposes than for growing timber. We intend to capitalize on the value of our timberland portfolio by opportunistically monetizing timberland properties. When evaluating our land sale opportunities, we assess a full range of matters relating to the timberland property or properties, including, but not limited to:

• | Suboptimal inventory stocking;


• | Predominantly hardwood merchantable inventory mix; and


• | Poor productivity.

The close proximity of our existing timberlands to several major population centers provides us with opportunities to periodically sell parcels of our land at favorable valuations. We generally expect to monetize 1% to 2% of our fee timberland acreage on an annual basis pursuant to our land sales program, although such results may vary. We may also decide to pursue various land entitlements on certain properties in order to realize higher long-term values on such properties.
Practice Sound Environmental Stewardship. We will remain committed to responsible environmental stewardship and sustainable forestry. Our timberlands, except those that have been recently acquired, have been third-party audited and certified in accordance with the 2015-2019 SFI standards. We are currently taking the necessary procedures to get our recently acquired timberlands third-party audited and certified in accordance with the SFI standards within the next 12 months. SFI standards promote sustainable forest management through recognized core principles, including

measures to protect water quality, biodiversity, wildlife habitat and at-risk species. Our timberlands are further managed to meet or exceed all state regulations through the implementation of best management practices as well as internal policies designed to ensure compliance. We believe our continued commitment to environmental stewardship will allow us to maintain our timberlands’ productivity, grow our customer base, and enhance our reputation as a preferred timber supplier. 
Financing Strategy
Our long-term financing strategy seeks to maximize balance sheet liquidity and operational flexibility for the purpose of generating current income and attractive long-term returns for our stockholders. We intend to employ prudent amounts of debt and equity financing as a means of providing additional funds for the selective acquisitions of timber assets, to refinance existing debt, or for general corporate purposes. In particular, we seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility by:

• | Maintaining sufficient liquidity through borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and cash-on-hand;


• | Minimizing the amount of near-term debt maturities in a single year;


• | Maintaining low to modest leverage; and


• | Maintaining access to diverse sources of capital.

We determine the amount of debt and equity financing to be used when acquiring an asset by evaluating terms available in the credit markets (such as interest rate, repayment provisions and maturity), our cost of equity capital, and our assessment of the particular asset’s risk. Historically, a significant portion of our debt has consisted of long-term borrowings secured by our timber assets. 
We anticipate that we will continue to use a number of different sources to finance our operations and selective acquisitions going forward, including cash from operations, proceeds from asset dispositions, funds available under bank credit facilities (which may or may not be secured by our assets), co-investments through partnerships or joint ventures, potential future issuances of common or preferred equity or partnership interests in our operating partnership or any combination of these sources, to the extent available to us, or other sources that may become available from time to time. 
Transaction Activities
We have executed the following timberland transactions:
Acquisitions
During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we acquired 81,900 acres, 42,900 acres, and 121,600 acres of timberlands, respectively, totaling 246,500 acres. The properties acquired are well stocked with merchantable pine inventory, located in strong pulpwood and sawtimber markets, and complement our existing timberland portfolio. Together, they added 10.3 million tons to our merchantable timber inventory, averaging 41 tons per acre, comprised of 75% pine plantations by acreage and 52% sawtimber by tons. Through these acquisitions, our timberland ownership expanded into Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. 
Land Sales
During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we sold 7,300, 6,400, and 3,800 acres of timberland, respectively, totaling 17,400 acres. These land sales represented approximately 1.7%, 1.7%, and 1.3%, respectively, of our average fee timberland acreage (based on average monthly fee timberland acreage) for each year. The disposed timberland acres had an average merchantable timber stocking of 31 tons per acre.

Timber Agreements
Mahrt Timber Agreements
We are party to a master stumpage agreement and a fiber supply agreement (collectively, the “Mahrt Timber Agreements”) with a wholly owned subsidiary of WestRock. The master stumpage agreement provides that we will sell specified amounts of timber and make available certain portions of our timberlands to CatchMark TRS for harvesting. The fiber supply agreement provides that WestRock will purchase specified tonnage of timber from CatchMark TRS at specified prices per ton, depending upon the type of timber product. The prices for the timber purchased pursuant to the fiber supply agreement are negotiated every two years but are subject to quarterly adjustments based on an index published by TimberMart-South, a quarterly trade publication that reports raw forest product prices in 11 southern states. The initial term of the Mahrt Timber Agreements is October 9, 2007 through December 31, 2032, subject to extension and early termination provisions. The Mahrt Timber Agreements ensure a long-term supply of wood fiber products for WestRock in order to meet its paperboard and lumber production requirements at specified mills and provide us with a reliable consumer for the wood products from our timberlands. 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, WestRock purchased approximately 485,000 tons under the Mahrt Timber Agreements, which exceeded the minimum requirement of 441,000 tons. See Note 6 – Commitments and Contingencies of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the material terms of the Mahrt Timber Agreements.
For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, approximately 17%, 23%, and 34%, respectively, of our net timber sales revenue was derived from the Mahrt Timber Agreements. For 2017, we are required to make available for purchase by WestRock, and WestRock is required to purchase, a minimum of approximately 518,000 tons of timber at fiber supply agreement pricing. 
Carolinas Supply Agreement
We assumed a pulpwood supply agreement (the "Carolinas Supply Agreement") in connection with our largest timberland acquisition since our listing on the NYSE in 2013, which closed on June 15, 2016 (the "Carolinas Midlands III transaction"). The Carolinas Supply Agreement requires us to harvest and sell agreed-upon pulpwood volumes to a third-party mill which they are required to purchase at defined market prices. Through its expiration on November 3, 2026, the Carolinas Supply Agreement is expected to represent between 100,000 to 150,000 tons of our annual harvest. 
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold approximately 88,000 tons under the Carolinas Supply Agreement, above the required 72,000 tons. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 4% of our net timber sales revenue was derived from the Carolinas Supply Agreement. For 2017, we are required to harvest and sell a minimum of approximately 150,000 tons of timber at the supply agreement pricing. 
Credit Risk of Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2016, our largest customer, WestRock, represented 24% of our consolidated revenues. No other customer represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. The loss of WestRock as a customer would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We sold timber to 68 customers in 2016, compared to 42 in 2015, an increase predominantly driven by recent timberland acquisitions.
We are not aware of any reason why our current customers will not be able to pay their contractual amounts as they become due in all material respects.

Competition 
We compete with various private and industrial timberland owners as well as governmental agencies that own or manage timberlands in the U.S. South. Due to transportation and delivery costs, pulp, paper and wood products manufacturing facilities typically purchase wood fiber within a 100-mile radius of their location, which thereby limits, to some degree, the number of significant competitors in any specific regional market. Factors affecting the level of competition in our industry include price, species, grade, quality, proximity to the mill customer, and our reliability and consistency as a supplier. Also, as we seek to acquire timberland assets, we are in competition for targeted timberland tracts with other similar timber investment companies, as well as investors in land for purposes other than growing timber. As a result, we may have to pay more for the timberland tracts to become the purchaser if another suitable tract cannot be substituted. When it becomes time to dispose of timberland tracts, we will again be in competition with sellers of similar tracts to locate suitable purchasers of timberland. 
Seasonality
Our harvest operations are affected by weather conditions, where wet weather could reduce our harvest volume but boost prices due to limited supply while dry weather could suppress prices due to increases in supply.
Environmental Matters 
See Item 1A — Risk Factors, Risk Related to Our Business and Operations for discussions of environmental matters that impact our business.
