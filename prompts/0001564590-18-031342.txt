Newton Federal Bank
 Newton Federal Bank is a federally chartered stock savings association headquartered in Covington, Georgia.  Newton Federal Bank was originally chartered in 1928 as a Georgia-chartered mutual building and loan association under the name Newton County Building and Loan Association.  In 1947, we converted to a federal charter and changed our name to “Newton Federal Savings and Loan Association.” In 2004 we changed our name to “Newton Federal Bank.”  In 2017 we reorganized from the mutual to the stock form of ownership.
 Our business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and, historically, investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and, to a lesser extent, commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, construction and land loans and consumer loans.  Subject to market conditions, we expect to increase our focus on originating commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, construction loans, and indirect automobile loans in an effort to diversify our overall loan portfolio, increase the overall yield earned on our loans and assist in managing interest rate risk.  We also invest in securities, which have historically consisted primarily of mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises and Federal Home Loan Bank stock.  We offer a variety of deposit accounts, including checking accounts, savings accounts and certificate of deposit accounts.  We have also used Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings to fund our operations. 
 Newton Federal Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  Newton Federal Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system.  Our website address is www.newtonfederal.com.   Information on our website is not considered a part of this report. 
 Market Area
 
We conduct our operations from our main office and branch office in Covington, Georgia, which are located in Newton County, Georgia, as well as our loan production offices located in (i) Watkinsville, Georgia, which is in Oconee County (in the Athens, Georgia market area) and (ii) Braselton, Georgia, which is in Jackson County.  Newton County, Georgia represents our primary geographic market area for deposits, while we make loans in Newton County and the contiguous counties.  In March 2018 we closed our Southside branch office in Covington at 10131 Carlin Avenue.  Although it no longer operates as a branch, we opened our indirect automobile lending division, Community First Auto, in this location on October 1, 2018.  
 
Covington, Georgia is located 35 miles east of Atlanta, Georgia and 47 miles south of Athens, Georgia. In Newton County, the manufacturing sector represents 24% of the non-farm, non-government labor force. This is more than double the state of Georgia. Other significant employer industries in the county include retail trades, health care and social assistance and food services and accommodations. There are approximately 1,390 businesses operating in Newton County.   Newton County’s total population is estimated at 110,196, which grew 10.2% from 2010.  The state of Georgia grew 9.4% during that period. Newton County is projected to grow 6.0% between 2019 and 2024, compared to 5.2% for Georgia.  The median household income in Newton County was approximately $51,082, which is higher than the Georgia state median of $59,397 and lower than the national median household income of $63,174.
 
Oconee County’s total population is estimated at 39,456, grew 20% since 2010, and is estimated to grow over 8% by 2024. It has approximately 1,118 businesses, with the largest employers in the construction, health care and social assistance, and professional, scientific, and technical services.
 
Clarke County has a total population of 129,527, grew 11.0% since 2010, and is projected to grow another 6.0% by 2024. It is the home to the University of Georgia. It is also home to 3,015 businesses, with the most significant employee representation in accommodation and food services, health care and social services, and retail trade.
 
Jackson County has a total population of 69,961, grew 15.7% since 2010, and is projected to grow another 8.2% by 2024. It has approximately 1,256 businesses, with the most significant employee representation in retail trade, construction, and other services (except public administration).
 
The unemployment rates in October 2018 for Newton, Oconee, Clarke, and Jackson Counties were 3.9%, 2.8%, 3.6% and 2.8%, respectively, compared to 3.6% for the State of Georgia and 3.5% for the United States.
 
We believe that we have developed products and services that will meet the financial needs of our current and future customer base; however, we plan, and believe it is necessary, to expand the range of products and services that we offer to be more competitive in our market area. Marketing strategies focus on the strength of our knowledge of local consumer and small business markets, as well as expanding relationships with current customers and reaching out to develop new, profitable business relationships.

Competition
 We face competition within our market area both in making loans and attracting deposits.  Our market area has a concentration of financial institutions that include large money center and regional banks, community banks and credit unions.  We also face competition from savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies and credit unions and, with respect to deposits, from money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies.  As of June 30, 2018 (the most recent date for which data is available), our market share of deposits represented 21.89% of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured deposits in Newton County, ranking us third in market share of deposits out of seven institutions operating in the county.  
Lending Activities  
 General.  Our historical principal lending activity has been originating one- to four-family residential real estate loans and, to a lesser extent, commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, construction and land loans and consumer loans. To a much lesser extent, we also originate multi-family residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit.  We initiated indirect automobile lending in October 2018.  Subject to market conditions, we expect to increase our focus on originating commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and construction loans in an effort to diversify our overall loan portfolio, increase the overall yield earned on our loans and assist in managing interest rate risk.  Historically, we have not originated significant amounts of loans for sale, but we originated, processed and sold several Small Business Administration (SBA) loans during 2018, and we intend to continue that activity in 2019.

----+---------------------------------------------------

 One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Lending.  The focus of our lending program has historically been the origination of one- to four-family residential real estate loans.  At September 30, 2018, we had $135.5 million of loans secured by one- to four-family real estate, representing 59.85% of our total loan portfolio.  We currently originate fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, including loans with balloon terms.  At September 30, 2018, $37.3 million, or 27.51%, of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans were balloon loans.  We have recently introduced adjustable-rate, one- to four-family residential real estate loans (in addition to our existing home equity loans and lines of credit, which are originated with adjustable interest rates).
 Our one- to four-family residential real estate loans are generally underwritten to internal guidelines, although we generally follow the documentation practices of Fannie Mae guidelines.  We generally originate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in amounts up to $150,000, although we will originate loans above this amount.  The significant majority of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area. 
 We generally limit the loan-to-value ratios of our one- to four-family residential mortgage loans to 89.9% of the purchase price or appraised value, whichever is lower.  
 Historically, our one- to four-family residential real estate loans typically have terms of up to 30 years.  We now offer adjustable rate mortgages with a five or seven year initial fixed rate.  Our balloon loans generally have terms of five or seven years, but with amortization terms of 30 years.  We will originate balloon loans with initial terms of ten years.       7


We do not offer “interest only” mortgage loans on permanent one- to four-family residential real estate loans (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan).  We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not currently offer “subprime loans” on one- to four-family residential real estate loans (i.e., generally loans to borrowers with credit scores less than 620).  
 Commercial Real Estate Loans.   In recent years, we have sought to increase our commercial real estate loans.  Our commercial real estate loans are secured primarily by one- to four-family non-owner occupied investment properties and houses of worship and, to a lesser extent, office buildings, industrial facilities, hotels, convenience stores and retail facilities, substantially all of which are located in our primary market area.  At September 30, 2018, we had $39.8 million in commercial real estate loans, representing 17.57% of our total loan portfolio.  This amount included $948,000 of multi-family residential real estate loans.  At September 30, 2018, our commercial real estate loans had an average balance of $404,000.
 Most of our commercial real estate loans are balloon loans with a five-year initial term and a 20-year amortization period.  The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our commercial real estate loans is generally 75%.  All of our commercial real estate loans are subject to our underwriting procedures and guidelines.  At September 30, 2018, our largest commercial real estate loan totaled $3 million and is a convenience store secured by 1.115 acres and an 8,282 square foot building.  At September 30, 2018, this loan was performing in accordance with its terms.  
 We consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate loans.  We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including credit history, profitability and expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property securing the loan.  When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower’s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service).  The significant majority of our commercial real estate loans are appraised by outside independent appraisers approved by the board of directors, although we are only required to obtain independent appraisals on commercial real estate loans in amounts of $500,000 or greater.  Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of commercial real estate borrowers.
 Commercial and Industrial Loans.  We make commercial and industrial loans, primarily in our market area, to a variety of professionals, sole proprietorships and small businesses.  These loans are generally secured by business assets, and we may support this collateral with junior liens on real property.  At September 30, 2018, commercial and industrial loans were $28.4 million, or 12.53% of our gross loans.  As part of our relationship driven focus, we encourage our commercial borrowers to maintain their primary deposit accounts with us, which enhances our interest rate spread and margin. 
 Commercial lending products include term loans and revolving lines of credit. Commercial loans and lines of credit are made with either adjustable or fixed rates of interest. Adjustable rates and fixed rates are based on the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin. We are focusing our efforts on experienced, growing small- to medium-sized, privately-held companies with solid historical and projected cash flow that operate in our market areas. 
 When making commercial and industrial loans, we consider the financial statements of the borrower, our lending history with the borrower, the debt service capabilities and global cash flows of the borrower and other guarantors, the projected cash flows of the business and the value of the collateral, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment.  Depending on the collateral used to secure the loans, commercial and industrial loans are made in amounts of up to 80% of the value of the collateral securing the loan.  All of these loans are secured by assets of the respective borrowers. 
 Our largest commercial and industrial loan at September 30, 2018 totaled $1.1 million, was originated in 2013 to a trucking company and is secured by accounts receivable.  At September 30, 2018, this loan was performing in accordance with its terms.  
 Construction and Land Loans.  We make construction loans, primarily to individuals for the construction of their primary residences and to contractors and builders of single-family homes. We also make a limited amount of land loans to complement our construction lending activities, as such loans are generally secured by lots that will be used for residential development.  Land loans also include loans secured by land purchased for investment purposes. At September 30, 2018, our construction loans totaled $20.2 million, representing 8.92% of our total loan portfolio, and included $200,000 of land loans.  At that date, we also had $5.6 million of construction loans in process.  At September 30, 2018, $5.4 million of our single-family construction loans were to individuals and $4.7 were to contractors and builders.

While we may originate loans to contractors and builders whether or not the collateral property underlying the loan is under contract for sale, we consider each project carefully in light of current residential real estate market conditions.  We actively monitor the number of unsold homes in our construction loan portfolio and local housing markets to attempt to maintain an appropriate balance between home sales and new loan originations.  We generally will limit the maximum number of speculative units (units that are not pre-sold) approved for each builder.  We have attempted to diversify the risk associated with speculative construction lending by doing business with experienced small and mid-sized builders within our market area.
 We also originate construction loans for commercial development projects, including retail buildings, houses of worship, small industrial, hotels and office buildings.  Most of our construction loans are interest-only loans that provide for the payment of interest during the construction phase, which is usually up to 12 months.  At the end of the construction phase, the loan may convert to a permanent mortgage loan or the loan may be paid in full. Construction loans generally can be made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75% of the estimated appraised market value upon completion of the project.  Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser.  We also generally require inspections of the property before disbursements of funds during the term of the construction loan.
 At September 30, 2018, our largest construction and land loan was for $2.8 million, of which $725,000 was outstanding. This loan was originated in 2018 and is secured by a convenience store with inline retail.  This loan was performing according to its terms at September 30, 2018.  
 Consumer Loans.  We offer a limited range of consumer loans, principally to customers residing in our primary market area with other relationships with us and with acceptable credit ratings.  Our consumer loans generally consist of loans secured by deposit accounts, loans on new and used automobiles and unsecured personal loans.  At September 30, 2018, consumer and other loans were $2.5 million, or 1.13% of gross loans. 
 In October 2018, our indirect automobile lending division, Community First Auto, opened an office in Covington, Georgia at a former branch location.  The bank has brought in an experienced manager and sales team to operate this line of business.  At September 30, 2018, we had no indirect automobile loans.  We intend to increase this type of lending.  
 Community First Auto (CFA) will purchase retail installment sales contracts from dealerships in the states of Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina.  Each dealership will submit credit applications to CFA for consideration.  CFA will fully underwrite each loan for credit worthiness, vehicle valuation, debt ratios and the consumer’s stability.  CFA will underwrite each loan carefully to ensure all credit policy guidelines are followed.  Applications that are approved and counter-offered will be submitted to CFA for verification and funding. 
 All dealerships that submit retail installment contracts to CFA will sign a separate retail dealer agreement that will make representations and warranties to CFA with respect to our security interest and the accuracy and validity of all information provided during the credit application and contract process.  Borrowers will be responsible for carrying full coverage insurance during the life of the loan, but CFA will have a blanket VSI policy in place to cover all loans in case of lapse of coverage, skip or confiscation.
 Loan Underwriting Risks
 Commercial Real Estate Loans.  Loans secured by commercial real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans.  The primary concern in commercial real estate lending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project.  Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties.  As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject, to a greater extent than residential real estate loans, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.  To monitor cash flows on income properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors to provide semi annual, quarterly or annual financial statements, depending on the size of the loan, on commercial real estate loans.  In reaching a decision on whether to make a commercial real estate loan, we consider and review a global cash flow analysis of the borrower and consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability and the value of the underlying property.  We have generally required that the properties securing these real estate loans have an aggregate debt service ratio, including the guarantor’s cash flow and the borrower’s other projects, of at least 1.20x.  An environmental phase one report is obtained when the possibility exists that hazardous materials may have existed on the site, or the site may have been impacted by adjoining properties that handled hazardous materials.

If we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate asset to cash can be lengthy with substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability.  Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on commercial real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial.  
 Commercial and Industrial Loans.  Unlike residential real estate loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial and industrial loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value.  Our commercial and industrial loans are originated primarily based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower.  Most often, this collateral consists of real estate, accounts receivable, inventory or equipment.  Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any.  Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value.  As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial and industrial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself.  
 Construction and Land Loans.  Our construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the completed project.  Underwriting is focused on the borrowers’ financial strength, credit history and demonstrated ability to produce a quality product and effectively market and manage their operations.  
 Construction lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent lending because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value prior to its completion.  Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio.  In addition, generally during the term of a construction loan, interest may be funded by the borrower or disbursed from an interest reserve set aside from the construction loan budget.  These loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest.  If the appraised value of a completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss.  
 Balloon Loans.  Although balloon mortgage loans may reduce to an extent our vulnerability to changes in market interest rates because they reprice at the end of the term, the ability of the borrower to renew or repay the loan and the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected if real estate values decline prior to the expiration of the term of the loan or in a rising interest rate environment.
 Adjustable-Rate Loans.  While we anticipate that adjustable-rate loans will better offset the adverse effects of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate loans, an increased monthly payment required of adjustable-rate loan borrowers in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults.  The marketability of the underlying collateral also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment.  
 Consumer Loans.  Consumer loans may entail greater risk than residential real estate loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and a small remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower.  Consumer loan collections depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are likely to be adversely affected by various factors, including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.  Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. 
 Indirect automobile loans are inherently risky as they are often secured by assets that may be difficult to locate and can depreciate rapidly.  In some cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted automobile loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency may not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower.  Automobile loan collections depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, or personal bankruptcy.  Additional risk elements associated with indirect lending include the limited personal contact with the borrower as a result of indirect lending through non-bank channels, namely automobile dealers.

Originations, Purchases and Sales of Loans
 Lending activities are conducted by our salaried loan personnel operating at our main and branch office locations and our loan production offices.  All loans originated by us are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures.  We primarily originate fixed-rate loans and balloon loans and, to a lesser extent, adjustable-rate loans.  Our ability to originate fixed-rate loans, balloon loans or adjustable-rate loans is dependent upon relative customer demand for such loans, which is affected by current and expected future levels of market interest rates.  We originate real estate and other loans through our loan officers, marketing efforts, our customer base, walk-in customers and referrals from real estate brokers, builders and attorneys.  
 We sometimes purchase whole loans from third parties to supplement our loan production.  These loans generally consist of loans to health care professionals and loans secured by manufactured housing.  At September 30, 2018, we had $5.2 million of whole loans that we purchased.  The majority of our purchased loans are to borrowers who are not located in our primary market area.  
 In addition, from time to time, we may purchase or sell participation interests in loans.  We underwrite our participation interest in the loan that we are purchasing according to our own underwriting criteria and procedures.  At September 30, 2018, we had $2.7 million of committed funds for loan participation interests that we purchased, and at that date, we had $9.3 million of loans for which we had sold participation interests.  
 Historically, we have not originated significant amounts of loans for sale, but we intend to increase this activity in the future in order to manage the duration and time to repricing of our loan portfolio, and to generate fee income.  We currently sell loans through the LenderSelect Mortgage Group and a new partnership with Quicken Loans has been added.  At September 30, 2018, we had no loans for sale, and we sold $1.3 million of loans during the year ended September 30, 2018, all on a servicing-released basis, generating $45,000 in fee income.  
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority
 Pursuant to federal law, the aggregate amount of loans that Newton Federal Bank is permitted to make to any one borrower or a group of related borrowers is generally limited to 15% of Newton Federal Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus (25% if the amount in excess of 15% is secured by “readily marketable collateral” or 30% for certain residential development loans).  At September 30, 2018, based on the 15% limitation, Newton Federal Bank’s loans-to-one-borrower limit was approximately $9.3 million.  On the same date, Newton Federal Bank had no borrowers with outstanding balances in excess of this amount.  At September 30, 2018, our largest loan relationship with one borrower was for $3.8 million, which was secured a home, towing and wrecker equipment and pawn shop, and the underlying loans were performing in accordance with their terms on that date.  
 Our lending is subject to written underwriting standards and origination procedures.  Decisions on loan applications are made on the basis of detailed applications submitted by the prospective borrower, credit histories that we obtain, and property valuations (consistent with our appraisal policy) prepared by outside independent licensed appraisers approved by our board of directors as well as internal evaluations, where permitted by regulations.  The loan applications are designed primarily to determine the borrower’s ability to repay the requested loan, and the more significant items on the application are verified through use of credit reports, bank statements and tax returns.  
 All loan approval amounts are based on the aggregate loans, including total balances of outstanding loans and the proposed loan to the individual borrower and any related entity. Each of our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Credit Officer and our Chief Lending Officer has individual authorization to approve loans up to $500,000.  Any two of these individuals can combine their authority to approve loans up to $1.0 million.  All three of these individuals can combine their authority to approve loans up to $1.5 million. The Officer Loan Committee, which consists of our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Operations Officer, a Commercial Lending Officer and a non-voting outside board member, can approve loans greater than $1.5 million up to $3.5 million.  Loans in excess of $3.5 million require the approval of our full board of directors.  
 Generally, we require title insurance or abstracts on our mortgage loans as well as fire and extended coverage casualty insurance in amounts at least equal to the principal amount of the loan or the value of improvements on the property, depending on the type of loan.  
 Delinquencies and Asset Quality
 Delinquency Procedures.  When a loan payment becomes 15 days past due, we contact the customer by mailing a late notice, and loan officers may contact their customers.  If a loan payment becomes 30 days past due, we mail an additional late notice and a loan-specific letter written by a collection representative, and we also place telephone calls to the borrower.  These loan collection efforts continue until a loan becomes 90 days past due, at which point we would refer the loan for foreclosure proceedings unless management determines that it is in the best interest of Newton Federal Bank to work further with the borrower to arrange a workout plan.  The foreclosure process would begin when a loan becomes 120 days delinquent.  From time to time we may accept deeds in lieu of foreclosure.  
 11


Loans Past Due and Non-Performing Assets.  Loans are reviewed on a regular basis.  Management determines that a loan is impaired or non-performing when it is probable at least a portion of the loan will not be collected in accordance with the original terms due to a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  When a loan is determined to be impaired, the measurement of the loan in the allowance for loan losses is based on present value of expected future cash flows, except that all collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. Non-accrual loans are loans for which collectability is questionable and, therefore, interest on such loans will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis. All loans that become 90 days or more delinquent are placed on non-accrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection.  When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received on a cash basis or cost recovery method.  
When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as real estate owned.  The real estate owned is recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.  Soon after acquisition, we order a new appraisal to determine the current market value of the property.  Any excess of the recorded value of the loan satisfied over the market value of the property is charged against the allowance for loan losses, or, if the existing allowance is inadequate, charged to expense of the current period.  After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed.  Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. 
 A loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring if, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties, we grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise consider. This usually includes a modification of loan terms, such as a reduction of the interest rate to below market terms, capitalizing past due interest or extending the maturity date and possibly a partial forgiveness of the principal amount due. Interest income on restructured loans is accrued after the borrower demonstrates the ability to pay under the restructured terms through a sustained period of repayment performance, which is generally six consecutive months.

Interest income that would have been recorded for the year ended September 30, 2018 had non-accruing loans been current according to their original terms amounted to $843,000.  We recognized $62,000 of interest income for these loans for the year ended September 30, 2018.  In addition, interest income that would have been recorded for the year ended September 30, 2018 had troubled debt restructurings been current according to their original terms amounted to $284,000.  We recognized $278,000 of interest income for these loans for the year ended September 30, 2018.  
 Classified Assets.  Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.”  An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.”  Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss 
 13


allowance is not warranted.  Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special mention” by our management.  
 When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses.  General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets.  When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount.  An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.
 In connection with the filing of our periodic reports with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations.
 On the basis of this review of our assets, our classified and special mention assets at the dates indicated were as follows:

Allowance for Loan Losses 
 The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which, in management’s judgment, is adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is based on management’s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the nature of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, specific impaired loans, and economic conditions. Allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows. Because of uncertainties associated with regional economic conditions, collateral values, and future cash flows on impaired loans, it is reasonably possible that management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance may change materially in the near-term. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is charged to expense and reduced by full and partial charge-offs, net of recoveries. Changes in the allowance relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses. Management’s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on various factors, including, but not limited to, management’s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses.
 As an integral part of their examination process, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will periodically review our allowance for loan losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for loan losses.  However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in the process for establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management.

Investment Activities
 General.  The goals of our investment policy are to provide liquidity, meet pledging requirements, generate a reasonable rate of return, and minimize risk.  Subject to loan demand and our interest rate risk analysis, we will increase the balance of our investment securities portfolio when we have excess liquidity.  We have invested a substantial portion of the proceeds of the offering in short-term and other investments, including U.S. government securities.  
 Our investment policy was adopted by the board of directors and is reviewed annually by the board of directors.  All investment decisions are made by our Asset/Liability Management Committee, consisting of our President and Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board, another member of the board of directors, and other members of senior management.  The Chief Financial Officer provides an investment schedule detailing the investment portfolio, which is reviewed at least monthly by the board of directors.
 Our current investment policy permits, with certain limitations, investments in: U.S. Treasury securities; securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies or government sponsored enterprises including mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac; corporate and municipal bonds; certificates of deposit in other financial institutions; federal funds and money market funds. 
 At September 30, 2018, our investment portfolio consisted of securities and obligations issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and municipal governments.  At September 30, 2018, we owned $580,400 of Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta stock.  As a member of Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, we are required to purchase stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, which stock is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities.

Sources of Funds
 General.  Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities.  We also may use borrowings to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds, but we have not needed to utilize borrowings in recent periods.  In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets.  While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition.
 Deposits.  Our deposits are generated primarily from our primary market area.  We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including savings accounts, checking accounts, certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts.  Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate.  We have not accepted brokered deposits in recent periods, although we have the authority to do so.  
 Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis.  Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. We rely upon personalized customer service, long-standing relationships with customers, and the favorable image of Newton Federal Bank in the community to attract and retain deposits.  We also seek to obtain deposits from our commercial loan customers. 
 The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts offered allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and responding to changes in consumer demand. Based on experience, we believe that our deposits are relatively stable. However, the ability to attract and maintain deposits and the rates paid on these deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. 
 The following table sets forth the distribution of total deposits by account type at the dates indicated.

TAXATION
 Community First Bancshares, MHC, Community First Bancshares, Inc. and Newton Federal Bank are subject to federal and state income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below.  The following discussion of federal and state taxation is intended only to summarize material income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Community First Bancshares, MHC, Community First Bancshares, Inc. and Newton Federal Bank.
 Our federal and state tax returns have not been audited for the past five years. 
 Federal Taxation 
 Method of Accounting.  For federal income tax purposes, Community First Bancshares, Inc. and Newton Federal Bank currently report income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and use a tax year ending September 30 for filing its federal income tax returns.  Community First Bancshares, Inc. and Newton Federal Bank file a consolidated federal income tax return.  The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for income taxes on bad debt reserves by savings institutions.  For taxable years beginning after 1995, Newton Federal Bank has been subject to the same bad debt reserve rules as commercial banks.  It currently utilizes the specific charge-off method under Section 582(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). 
 Minimum Tax.  The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, less an exemption amount, referred to as “alternative minimum taxable income.”  The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent tax computed this way exceeds tax computed by applying the regular tax rates to regular taxable income.  Net operating losses can, in general, offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income.  Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has repealed the Alternative Minimum Tax for income generated after January 1, 2018. At September 30, 2018, the Company had no minimum tax credit carryovers.  
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers.  As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generally, a financial institution may carry net operating losses forward indefinitely.  At September 30, 2018, Community First Bancshares, Inc. had no federal net operating loss carryforwards.
 Capital Loss Carryovers.  A corporation cannot recognize capital losses in excess of capital gains generated.  Generally, a financial institution may carry back capital losses to the preceding three taxable years and forward to the succeeding five taxable years.  Any capital loss carryback or carryover is treated as a short-term capital loss for the year to which it is carried.  As such, it is grouped with any other capital losses for the year to which it is carried and is used to offset any capital gains.  Any undeducted loss remaining after the five-year carryover period is not deductible.   At September 30, 2018, Community First Bancshares, Inc. had no capital loss carryovers.  
 Corporate Dividends.  Community First Bancshares, Inc. may generally exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from Newton Federal Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
 20


State Taxation
 Newton Federal Bank is treated as a financial institution under Georgia state income tax law. The state of Georgia subjects financial institutions to all state and local taxes in the same manner and to the same extent as other business corporations in Georgia. Additionally, depository financial institutions are subject to local business license taxes and a special occupation tax. 
 Consolidated Group Return. Georgia is not a unitary business state. Affiliated corporations that file a consolidated federal income tax return must file separate income tax returns unless they have prior approval or have been requested to file a consolidated return by the Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Revenue.  For state income tax purposes, Community First Bancshares, Inc. and Newton Federal Bank file a consolidated federal income tax return. Net Operating Loss Carryovers.  Generally, Georgia law conforms to federal law and a financial institution may carry back Georgia net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years.  At September 30, 2018, Newton Federal Bank had no Georgia net operating loss carryforwards.
 Bank Tax Credit. All financial depositary institutions that conduct business or own property in Georgia are required to file a Georgia Financial Institutions Business Occupation Tax based on Georgia gross receipts. Any local license tax and state occupation tax paid a depository financial institution is credited dollar for dollar against any state corporate income tax liability of such institution for the tax year during which any such tax is paid. Any unused credits may be carried forward for five years. At September 30, 2018, Newton Federal Bank had $412,500 of bank tax credits available for future use.
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 General 
 As a federal savings association, Newton Federal Bank is subject to examination and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and is also subject to examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which Newton Federal Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Deposit Insurance Fund.  This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s deposit insurance fund and depositors, and not for the protection of security holders.  Newton Federal Bank also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.  
 Under this system of regulation, the regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory, enforcement, rulemaking and examination activities and policies, including rules or policies that: establish minimum capital levels; restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments; govern the classification of assets; determine the adequacy of loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes; and establish the timing and amounts of assessments and fees.  Moreover, as part of their examination authority, the banking regulators assign numerical ratings to banks and savings institutions relating to capital, asset quality, management, liquidity, earnings and other factors.  These ratings are inherently subjective and the receipt of a less than satisfactory rating in one or more categories may result in enforcement action by the banking regulators against a financial institution.  A less than satisfactory rating may also prevent a financial institution, such as Newton Federal Bank or its holding company, from obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to access the capital markets, pay dividends, acquire other financial institutions or establish new branches.
 In addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations, Community Reinvestment Act laws and regulations, and fair lending laws and regulations.  Government agencies have the authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on institutions that fail to comply with these laws and regulations, which could significantly affect our business activities, including our ability to acquire other financial institutions or expand our branch network.
 As a savings and loan holding company, Community First Bancshares, Inc. is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board.  It is required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board.  Community First Bancshares, Inc. is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.  
 Any change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of Community First Bancshares, Inc. and Newton Federal Bank.  
 21


Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to Newton Federal Bank and Community First Bancshares, Inc.  The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Newton Federal Bank and Community First Bancshares, Inc.
 Federal Banking Regulation 
 Business Activities.  A federal savings association derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended, and applicable federal regulations.  Under these laws and regulations, Newton Federal Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits.  The Dodd-Frank Act authorized, for the first time, the payment of interest on commercial checking accounts.  Newton Federal Bank may also establish, subject to specified investment limits, service corporation subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for Newton Federal Bank, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage.  
 Examinations and Assessments.   Newton Federal Bank is primarily supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  Newton Federal Bank is required to file reports with and is subject to periodic examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  Newton Federal Bank is required to pay assessments to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to fund the agency’s operations.
 Capital Requirements.  Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions, including federal savings associations, to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.  The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
 The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively.  The regulations also establish a minimum required leverage ratio of at least 4% Tier 1 capital.  Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt.  Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values.  Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities).  Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, an institution’s assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risk deemed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk.  For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.  The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.  
 
As a result of the recently enacted Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking agencies are required to develop a “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” (the ratio of a bank’s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion.  A “qualifying community bank” that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be 
 22


considered “well capitalized” under Prompt Corrective Action statutes.  The federal banking agencies may consider a financial institution’s risk profile when evaluating whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the capital ratio requirement. The federal banking agencies must set the minimum capital for the new Community Bank Leverage Ratio at not less than 8% and not more than 10%.  A financial institution can elect to be subject to this new definition.
 At September 30, 2018, Newton Federal Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements. 
 Loans-to-One Borrower.  Generally, a federal savings association may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus.  An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by “readily marketable collateral,” which generally includes certain financial instruments (but not real estate).  As of September 30, 2018, Newton Federal Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations. 
 Standards for Safety and Soundness.  Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions.  These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate.  Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired.  If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.  Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties.
 Prompt Corrective Action.  Under the federal Prompt Corrective Action statute, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s level of capital.  An institution that has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5% or a leverage ratio of less than 4% is considered to be “undercapitalized.”  A savings institution that has total risk-based capital of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0% or a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0% is considered to be “significantly undercapitalized.”  A savings institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2.0% is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.”  
 Generally, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a federal savings association that becomes “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames.  The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency within 45 days of the date that a federal savings association is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.”  Any holding company of a federal savings association that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee performance under the plan in an amount of up to the lesser of 5.0% of the savings association’s assets at the time it was deemed to be undercapitalized by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the amount necessary to restore the savings association to adequately capitalized status.  This guarantee remains in place until the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency notifies the savings association that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters.  Institutions that are undercapitalized become subject to certain mandatory measures such as restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth.  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized federal savings associations, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.  
 At September 30, 2018, Newton Federal Bank met the criteria for being considered “well capitalized,” which means that its total risk-based capital ratio exceeded 10%, its Tier 1 risk-based ratio exceeded 8.0%, its common equity Tier 1 ratio exceeded 6.5% and its leverage ratio exceeded 5.0%
 Qualified Thrift Lender Test.  As a federal savings association, Newton Federal Bank must satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or “QTL,” test.  Under the QTL test, Newton Federal Bank must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months of every 12-month period.  “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets of a savings association, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings association’s business.
 Alternatively, Newton Federal Bank may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.
 23


A savings association that fails the QTL test must operate under specified restrictions set forth in the Home Owners’ Loan Act.  The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law.  At September 30, 2018, Newton Federal Bank satisfied the QTL test.
 Capital Distributions.  Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings association, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the savings association’s capital account.  A federal savings association must file an application with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for approval of a capital distribution if:

• | the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings association’s net income for that year to date plus the savings association’s retained net income for the preceding two years;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the savings association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory condition; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the savings association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings association that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as Newton Federal Bank, must file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend.
 An application or notice related to a capital distribution may be disapproved if:
  
• | the federal savings association would be undercapitalized following the distribution;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution shall not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement.  
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws.  All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers.  In connection with its examination of a federal savings association, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to assess the federal savings association’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.  A savings association’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities.  In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes.  The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.  
 The Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating.  Newton Federal Bank received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination. 
 Transactions with Related Parties.  A federal savings association’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation.  An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as Newton Federal Bank.  Community First Bancshares, Inc. will be an affiliate of Newton Federal Bank because of its control of Newton Federal Bank.  In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements.  In addition, federal regulations prohibit a savings association from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary.  Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates.  
 24


Newton Federal Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board.  Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders:
  
• | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Newton Federal Bank’s capital.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Newton Federal Bank’s board of directors.  Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved.
 Enforcement.  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings associations and has authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on a federal savings association.  Formal enforcement action by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.  Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1.0 million per day.  The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings association.  If such action is not taken, the FDIC has authority to take the action under specified circumstances.
 Insurance of Deposit Accounts.  The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions such as Newton Federal Bank.  Deposit accounts in Newton Federal Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts.  
 The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions were assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors.  An institution’s rate depended upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations. Institutions deemed less risky pay lower FDIC assessments.  The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits.  The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity.  
 Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated the risk categories.  Assessments for most institutions are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years.  In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio achieving 1.15%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for most banks and savings associations to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points.
 In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. All bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature by the end of the third quarter of 2019.  For the quarter ended September 30, 2018, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.32 basis points of total assets less tangible capital. 
 The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments.  Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Newton Federal Bank.  Newton Federal Bank cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.  We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.

Federal Home Loan Bank System.  Newton Federal Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks.  The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending.  As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, Newton Federal Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank.  As of September 30, 2018, Newton Federal Bank was in compliance with this requirement.  While Newton Federal Bank’s ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta provides an additional source of liquidity, Newton Federal Bank has historically not used Federal Home Loan Bank advances to fund its operations.
 Proposed Federal Regulation
 
On September 10, 2018, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a proposed rule implementing a section of the Economic Growth, Relief and Consumer Protection Act that permits an eligible federal savings association with total consolidated assets of $20 billion or less as of December 31, 2017, to elect to operate with national bank powers without converting to a national bank charter.  An eligible savings association is a federal savings association that: (1) is well capitalized; (2) has a CAMELs composite rating of 1 or 2; (3) has a consumer compliance rating of 1 or 2; (4) has a Community Reinvestment Act rating of “outstanding” or “satisfactory,” if applicable; and (5) is not subject to an enforcement action.  The proposed rule is subject to change, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will issue a final rule after reviewing all comments on the proposal.
Other Regulations
 Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Newton Federal Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates.  Newton Federal Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:

Holding Company Regulation
 General.  Community First Bancshares, Inc. and Community First Bancshares, MHC are non-diversified savings and loan holding companies within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act.  As such, Community First Bancshares, Inc. and Community First Bancshares, MHC are registered with the Federal Reserve Board and be subject to the regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to savings and loan holding companies.  In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Community First Bancshares, Inc., Community First Bancshares, MHC and its non-savings institution subsidiaries.  Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution.    
 Permissible Activities. Under present law, the business activities of Community First Bancshares, Inc. and Community First Bancshares, MHC are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, provided certain conditions are met and financial holding company status is elected, or for multiple savings and loan holding companies.  A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity.  A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to regulatory approval, and certain additional activities authorized by federal regulations.  Community First Bancshares, Inc. and Community First Bancshares, MHC have not elected financial holding company status.
 Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including Community First Bancshares, Inc. and Community First Bancshares, MHC, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company, without prior Federal Reserve Board approval.  In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board considers factors such as the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
 The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions:

• | the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Capital.  Savings and loan holding companies have historically not been subjected to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to establish for all bank and savings and loan holding companies minimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries.  However, the Federal Reserve Board has extended to savings and loan holding companies the applicability of the “Small Bank Holding Company” exception to its consolidated capital requirements and, as a result of recent legislation, increased the threshold for the exception from $1.0 billion in assets to $3.0 billion. As a result, savings and loan holding companies with less than $3.0 billion in consolidated assets are generally not subject to the capital requirements unless otherwise advised by the Federal Reserve Board. 
 Source of Strength.  The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies.  The Federal Reserve Board has issued regulations requiring that all savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions.
 27


Dividends and Stock Repurchases.  The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by holding companies.  In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall supervisory financial condition.  Separate regulatory guidance provides for prior consultation with Federal Reserve Bank staff concerning dividends in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate or earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition.  The ability of a savings and loan holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary savings association becomes undercapitalized.  The regulatory guidance also states that a savings and loan holding company should inform Federal Reserve Bank supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the savings and loan holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, at the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred.  These regulatory policies may affect the ability of Community First Bancshares, Inc. to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
 Waivers of Dividends by Community First Bancshares, MHC.   Community First Bancshares, Inc. may pay dividends on its common stock to public stockholders. If it does, it is also required to pay dividends to Community First Bancshares, MHC, unless Community First Bancshares, MHC elects to waive the receipt of dividends. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, Community First Bancshares, MHC must receive the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may waive the receipt of any dividends from Community First Bancshares, Inc. The Federal Reserve Board has issued an interim final rule providing that it will not object to dividend waivers under certain circumstances, including circumstances where the waiver is not detrimental to the safe and sound operation of the savings association and a majority of the mutual holding company’s members have approved the waiver of dividends by the mutual holding company within the previous twelve months. In addition, for a “non-grandfathered” mutual holding company such as Community First Bancshares, MHC, each officer or director of Community First Bancshares, Inc. and Newton Federal Bank, and any tax-qualified stock benefit plan or non-tax-qualified stock benefit plan in which such individual participates that holds any shares of stock to which the waiver would apply, must waive the right to receive any such dividend declared. In addition, any dividends waived by Community First Bancshares, MHC must be considered in determining an appropriate exchange ratio in the event of a conversion of the mutual holding company to stock form.
 Acquisition.  Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a savings and loan holding company.  Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in control of the company.  A change in control definitively occurs upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock.  Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition.
 Federal Securities Laws

 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws.  We have policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations.

Emerging Growth Company Status
 Community First Bancshares, Inc. is an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act.  We will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial stock offering, (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1.07 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities or (iv) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.  We expect to lose our status as an emerging growth company in April 2022, five years after the completion of our stock offering.  An “emerging growth company” may choose not to hold stockholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say-on-pay” votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation; however, Community First Bancshares, Inc. will also not be subject to the auditor attestation requirement or additional executive compensation disclosure so long as it remains a “smaller reporting company” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally a company with less than $250 million of voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates). Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement.  Community First Bancshares, Inc. has elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies.  Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
