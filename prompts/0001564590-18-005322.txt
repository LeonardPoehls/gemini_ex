Overview
 Mattersight Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, we, us, or ours) is a leader in behavioral analytics and a pioneer in personality-based software products. Using a stack of innovative, patented applications, including predictive behavioral routing, performance management, quality assurance, and predictive analytics (collectively, Behavioral Analytics), we analyze and predict customer behavior based on the language exchanged between agents and customers during brand interactions. These insights are then used to facilitate more effective and effortless customer conversations, which, in turn, drive increased customer satisfaction and retention, employee engagement, and operating efficiency. Our analytics are based on millions of proprietary algorithms and the application of unique behavioral models. Our solutions have influenced hundreds of millions of shorter, more satisfying customer interactions for leading companies in the healthcare, insurance, financial services, technology, telecommunications, cable, utilities, education, hospitality, and government industries. 
 Mattersight Corporation (formerly known as eLoyalty Corporation), a corporation organized under State of Delaware law, was incorporated May 11, 1999, as a spin-out from TSC/ECM Inc.

Our multi-channel technology captures the unstructured data of voice interactions (conversations), related customer and employee data, and employee desktop activity, and applies millions of proprietary algorithms against those interactions. Each interaction contains hundreds of attributes that get scored and ultimately detect patterns of behavior or business process that provide the transparency and predictability necessary to enhance revenue, improve the customer experience, improve efficiency, and predict and navigate outcomes. Adaptive across industries, programs, and industry-specific processes, our Behavioral Analytics offerings enable our clients to drive measurable economic benefit through the improvement of contact center performance, customer satisfaction and retention, fraud reduction, and streamlined back office operations. Specifically, through our Behavioral Analytics offerings, we help clients:

 Types of Revenue
 Through the sale of our services featuring these applications, we generate the following types of revenue:
 Subscription Revenue
 Subscription revenue consists of revenue derived from Mattersight’s Behavioral Analytics service offerings, including predictive behavioral routing, performance management, quality assurance, predictive analytics, and marketing managed services revenue derived from the performance of services on a continual basis.
 Subscription revenue is based on a number of factors, such as the number of users to whom we provide one or more of our Behavioral Analytics offerings, the type and number of Behavioral Analytics offerings deployed to the client, and in some cases, the number of hours of calls analyzed during the relevant month of the subscription period. Subscription periods generally range from one to three years after the go-live date or, in cases where the Company contracts with a client for a short-term pilot of a Behavioral Analytics offering prior to committing to a longer subscription period, if any, the subscription or pilot periods generally range from three to twelve months after the go-live date. This revenue is recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service is performed for the client.
 Other Revenue
 Other revenue consists of deployment revenue, professional services revenue, and reimbursed expenses revenue.
 2

Deployment revenue consists of planning, deployment, and training fees derived from Behavioral Analytics contracts. These fees, which are considered to be installation fees related to Behavioral Analytics subscription contracts, are deferred until the installation is complete and are then recognized over the applicable subscription or pilot period. Installation costs incurred are deferred up to an amount not to exceed the amount of deferred installation revenue and additional amounts that are recoverable based on the contractual arrangement. These costs are included in prepaid expenses and other long-term assets. Such costs are amortized over the subscription period. Costs in excess of the foregoing revenue amount are expensed in the period incurred.
 Professional services revenue primarily consists of fees charged to our clients to provide post-deployment follow-on consulting services, which include custom data analysis, the implementation of enhancements, and training, as well as fees generated from our operational consulting services. The professional services are performed for our clients on a fixed-fee or time-and-materials basis. Revenue is recognized as the services are performed, with performance generally assessed on the ratio of actual hours incurred to-date compared with the total estimated hours over the entire term of the contract.
 Reimbursed expenses revenue includes billable costs related to travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred while performing services for our clients. An equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in total cost of other revenue.
 Business Segments
 We operate in a single business segment, focused primarily on Behavioral Analytics. Financial information concerning our business segment is included in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
International Operations
 Our services are currently delivered to clients in the United States, however prior to November 2015, we had also delivered services to a client in the United Kingdom. Our revenue is and has been recognized in our U.S. entity. Our long-lived assets are and have been predominately located in the United States and consist of equipment, software, furniture and fixtures, and leasehold improvements (net of accumulated depreciation and amortization).
Methods of Distribution
 Subscription and other revenues are generated by direct contractual relationships with clients.
 Intellectual Property Rights
 General
 Our ability to protect our software, methodologies, and other intellectual property is important to our success and our competitive position. We view as proprietary the software (including source code), algorithms, analyses, and other ideas, concepts, and developments that we create in order to provide, improve, and enhance our service offerings, as well as the work product we create in the course of providing services for clients. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights in these developments and work product by relying on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret law, and confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees and third parties.
Patents
 As of December 31, 2017, we held forty-five U.S. patents and one European patent and have applied for over twenty patents. These patents cover a broad range of our analytics capabilities, including methods for analyzing language to assess customer personality, routing customers based on personality in real time, optimizing routing to improve agent performance, and analyzing data to improve employee performance. Our issued patents will expire between 2025 and 2036.
Trademarks
 We have obtained U.S. federal trademark registration for the MATTERSIGHT word mark and our tagline “The Chemistry of Conversation”. We believe that the registration of the MATTERSIGHT word mark and tagline in the United States is material to our operations.

Licenses
 A majority of our clients require that we grant to them licenses in and to the intellectual property rights associated with the work product we create in the course of providing services. In some cases, our clients require assignment of ownership in the intellectual property rights to such work product, typically where such work product incorporates their confidential information or would provide them some competitive advantage in their industry. Absent an agreement to the contrary, each assignment of ownership in intellectual property rights would result in our inability to reuse the relevant work product with other clients. As a result, it is our practice to retain the rights in the underlying core intellectual property on which such work product is based, including methodologies, workplans, and software, as well as residual know-how. If we are unable to retain such rights, it is our policy to obtain from our clients a broad license to sell service offerings using such work product to other clients. 
Seasonality
 We typically experience modest increases in revenue and earnings from our healthcare clients during the fourth quarter due to annual healthcare enrollment periods and increased claims processing at year-end.  We also see increases in revenue from our retail clients due to the peak shopping season during the fourth quarter. Any other seasonal impact to our revenue and earnings is limited, as a significant portion of our revenue is earned through our Behavioral Analytics subscription services, which is of a recurring nature.

 Competition
 Although we believe the manner in which we provide Behavioral Analytics, and our benefits, to be unique, we nonetheless operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing market and compete with a variety of organizations that offer services that may be viewed as similar to ours. These competitive organizations include data analytics solutions providers, voice recording and voice analytic services providers and software licensors, call routing solution providers, and strategic consulting firms.  We believe few competitors offer the full range and depth of services that we can provide, but they may compete with us on individual factors such as expertise, price, or capacity.
 4

Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, more clients, longer relationships with their clients, greater brand or name recognition, and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and public relations resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be in a better position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements. They may also develop and promote their products and services more effectively than we do. New market entrants also pose a threat to our business. Existing or future competitors may develop or offer solutions that are comparable or superior to ours at a lower price.
 Environmental Issues
 There are no known material issues regarding our compliance with any Federal, state, or local environmental regulations.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we employed 281 persons, none of whom is represented by a union. We consider our employee relations to be good.
