 Item 1.Business
 Overview
 We are a leading digital communication platform, enabling businesses to engage with their customers via email reliably, effectively and at scale. Our cloud-based platform allows for frictionless adoption and immediate value creation for businesses, providing their developers and marketers with the tools to seamlessly and effectively reach their customers using email. Since our inception we have processed more than one trillion emails.
 Increasingly, today’s transactions are digital. They happen online and are often automatic and recurring. Consumers want a seamless experience and have come to expect that their online activity will be recorded in their email inbox. Email serves as the system of record for a consumer’s digital life, delivering purchase receipts, shipping notifications, account information, social media updates, reservations, and website login data. Email is the primary communication channel in the digital world, with 125 billion commercial emails sent every day, according to a 2017 Radicati Group report. Email is also a trusted marketing tool for businesses. Businesses rely on email to send customers notifications, promotions, and personalized content because email is effective, searchable, and permanent. An email-based promotion can reach the right user at the right time, with a high degree of certainty that the user will see it. According to The Inbox Report 2017, in 2016 nearly 80% of Americans checked their email daily. According to a 2015 Direct Marketing Association report, email demonstrated the highest return on investment among all forms of digital communication, generating $38 in revenue for every $1 invested.
 While email offers a compelling value proposition for businesses, effective email delivery at scale is complex and difficult. Inbox service providers, including Google Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, and Yahoo! Mail, evaluate incoming email and block the delivery of harmful or unwanted email. However, these filters can also prevent the delivery of wanted email. According to a 2017 Return Path report for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2017, only 80% of wanted email reached its intended recipient. To manage email delivery on their own, businesses must understand the complexities associated with both sending millions or billions of transactional and marketing emails and the unique dynamics of numerous inbox service providers. Dedicated servers and databases, domain expertise, continuous monitoring of email protocols and a team of people are all necessary to maintain a robust internally-developed email communications system. The use of developer resources in this effort can reduce businesses investment in product innovation and other priorities. Without an effective, easy to use system, marketers seeking to reach customers via email can also expend significant time and resources without accomplishing their marketing goals.
 SendGrid was founded in 2009 by developers who were frustrated with their own experiences in managing email delivery. They wanted to build a system “that just worked” for developers and allowed them to focus on strategic business activities. They developed a robust technology platform incorporating their domain expertise and created an Application Programming Interface, or API, that allowed for easy integration by businesses. We built our business model around serving the developer, including self-service adoption and a frictionless user experience. We have extended this platform over time to serve the similar email delivery needs of marketers.
 We offer our customers three services: our Email API; Marketing Campaigns; and Expert Services. Our Email API service allows developers to use our API in their preferred development framework to leverage our platform to add email functionality to their applications within minutes. This service enables businesses to send thousands or billions of emails, all with the same high level of service and reliability, and incorporates proprietary technology and domain expertise to significantly improve deliverability rates. Our Marketing Campaigns service allows marketers to upload and manage customer contact lists, create and test email templates, and then execute and analyze multi-faceted email campaigns that engage customers and drive growth. Our Expert Services help businesses further optimize their email delivery. With our platform, businesses can achieve industry leading email deliverability that translates into higher brand engagement with their customers. For 2017, 2016, and 2015, revenue from our Email API service and our Marketing Campaigns service represented 80%, 79%, and 79% and 13%, 9%, and 1% of our total revenue, respectively.
 Our category leadership, self-service model, and company culture have enabled us to attract and retain customers and employees and continue to develop innovative solutions for email delivery. Our platform is designed to serve the

communication needs of small and midsize businesses, or SMBs, and large enterprises across industries. Our pricing model and extensive document library make our platform accessible to developers and marketers alike, irrespective of their expertise or the scale of their needs. We deliver our services through a self-service cloud-based subscription model, where businesses primarily sign up for our services through our website. We offer transparent and affordable pricing, generally on a per month basis by volume of email and typically paid by credit card. In addition, we have robust documentation for onboarding and ongoing usage. We have developed a broad user and partner community available for help and support. This self-service delivery model has enabled us to rapidly attract customers while operating our business efficiently.
 Businesses of all sizes and across industries depend on our digital communication platform. As of December 31, 2017, we had over 63,000 customers globally, an increase of 39% year over year. While we serve large enterprises, we primarily serve SMBs that rely on email to power their businesses and are rapidly adopting cloud services. Our self-service model has allowed us to efficiently acquire SMB customers that historically have not been a focus for companies that depend on large enterprise sales forces. Our robust platform and the increasing breadth of our services allow us to scale with our customers as they grow.
 Industry Trends
 Email Is the Primary Commercial Communications Channel in the Digital World
 Businesses increasingly interact with their customers through digital channels. Many emerging businesses are digital first. They primarily engage with customers through online and mobile channels. Customers of these businesses rarely interact with sales people, collect paper receipts, track orders over the phone or mail in their bills. Customers enjoy and increasingly demand one-click purchases, recurring home deliveries and automated online services and depend on email as their system of record for their transactions.
 Businesses send emails to their customers daily because marketers know they can reach a wide audience and personalize interactions, while trusting emails will reach their target recipient. Digital channels allow businesses to engage with their customers in a more personalized way. Consumers leave a digital footprint of their transaction history and preferences, enabling businesses to analyze demographic information and buying behavior in order to deliver highly personalized digital experiences. The emergence of smart phones and other personal devices has enabled convenient online access by consumers, who as a result expect instant access to information and services. These dynamics have created the opportunity for frequent customer engagement and targeted marketing. Businesses must be able to react quickly and effectively in order to take advantage of this opportunity.
 Email Is Used for Multiple Business Purposes
 Businesses send email in three different forms to connect with customers:
 Transactional (Recipient Initiated, One-to-One)
 A transactional email is generated whenever an event occurs, such as a purchase, payment, password reset, account creation, shipping notification, and social media update. Nearly all websites and applications require a unique email address to sign up or login, establishing email as the system of record for the transaction.
 Marketing (One-to-Many)
 One-to-many marketing email is sent as a single message to a large distribution list, and includes promotions, newsletters, buy now, sign up now, and special offers.
 Marketing (Personalized, One-to-One)
 Personalized marketing email is based on unique data about the recipient and is the most difficult type of marketing email to produce but can be the most valuable to businesses. To generate a personalized marketing email, businesses can apply data analysis techniques to generate an email specific to that user at the right time.

 Email Is Highly Effective at Driving Customer Engagement and Revenue
 Email accounts are widespread, and each is personal to its owner and consistent across time, making email a highly effective method of communication between businesses and consumers. Individuals with email accounts check their email throughout the day, every day. The use of smartphones for always-on access has only increased this effectiveness.  Effective Email Delivery Is Difficult
 While email offers a compelling value proposition, businesses struggle to achieve effective email delivery due to a number of factors.
 The Email Recipient’s Side
 Inbox service providers, including Google Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, and Yahoo! Mail, use sophisticated filters to analyze incoming email and prevent the delivery of harmful or unwanted email, often blocking wanted email as well. Recipient systems analyze factors such as sender reputation, email content, past spam or phishing complaints, invalid addresses, blacklists, and domain name reputation with the goal of verifying legitimate email. If an email does not pass one of these filters, the system will automatically block the email from the recipient’s inbox, with the addressee likely not even knowing it was blocked. The cost of delivery failure includes not only the infrastructure expense associated with processing the email, but more importantly, the lost revenue for a business from a new or existing customer. We estimate businesses lose tens of billions of dollars in revenue every year from failed email delivery. The Email Sender’s Side
 Maintaining an email delivery system is complex. Domain expertise, dedicated resources, and the need to satisfy complex technical requirements are all required to operate an effective email delivery system, particularly at scale.
 To be effective, businesses must understand the complexities of building a sender reputation and how to maintain that reputation across inbox service providers, spam houses, blacklist managers and industry watchdogs. This effectiveness requires strong relationships with postmasters at major inbox service providers to understand their protocols and proprietary methods in order to optimize delivery and resolve sender reputation issues quickly. Businesses must also synthesize a vast array of rapidly changing regulations, including privacy laws, that differ significantly by country.
 Building and managing an email delivery system is resource-intensive and costly. To deliver billions of emails to thousands of recipients, businesses need dedicated infrastructure, including servers and databases, as well as an understanding of protocols to communicate with the recipient servers, including Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, or SMTP, and APIs. Businesses also need to build, maintain, and manage distribution lists across various applications and integrate relevant information from disparate databases into the email system.
 Businesses Are Adopting Cloud Services to Reduce Complexity and Focus on Core Functions
 Technological innovation has enabled businesses to improve efficiency, but it has also lowered barriers to entry and raised customer expectations. Businesses of all sizes must adapt quickly to changing market needs in order to grow and compete. As a result, businesses are turning to cloud services to manage complex and costly parts of their IT infrastructure and operations. For example, more than one million companies use Amazon Web Services for computing, network and storage infrastructure, over $20 billion in online payments has been processed by Stripe, over 500,000 businesses are powered by Shopify, and billions of Short Message Service, or SMS, messages have been sent using Twilio. Cloud services can seamlessly provide many of the critical, but non-core, components for a business, allowing it to maximize the value of internal resources by focusing on its core differentiating competencies. Frictionless, Self-Service Models Are Driving High Adoption of Cloud Services
 The ease of cloud service delivery is driving a move from multi-million-dollar capital purchases of on-premises IT infrastructure to recurring lower-cost subscriptions for cloud services. Many cloud services providers are also making it easier for end users to experiment with and adopt their technologies by deploying self-service models. These services 

 
  7

 
enable easy integration with existing IT systems and business workflows. As a result, self-service models enable cloud services providers to broaden their customer reach to include SMBs that have not been well-served by traditional enterprise sales forces. This change has increased the influence of line of business owners, developers and marketers in technology purchasing decisions compared to a traditional Chief Information Officer led purchasing process. Developers at businesses of all sizes can now conduct research to find solutions to meet their needs and adopt cloud services on their own, often using credit cards for purchases instead of purchase orders. This enables developers and marketers to sign up for services on the Internet and be up and running in minutes. With cloud services, developers and marketers exert greater control over how they allocate their resources.
 Businesses Need to Effectively and Efficiently Send Wanted Email at Scale
 Email is critical to building and growing customer relationships, but it requires significant resources and expertise to manage the complex underlying infrastructure. Businesses are turning to cloud services providers to provide transactional and marketing email services. The developers and marketers who are driving purchasing decisions of cloud services need a transactional and marketing email solution that possesses the following characteristics:
· | Reliability: continuous uptime to send secure emails at any time
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | Effectiveness: high delivery rates and high consumer engagement
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | Scalability: ability to send billions of emails across a range of customer use cases, with the same level of effectiveness
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ease of Adoption and Integration: self-service onboarding and integration
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Affordability: lower, predictable cost versus an internal system and accessible to businesses of all sizes
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Benefits of Our Solution
 Key benefits of our solution include:
 Platform Reliability
 Businesses rely on our platform to power their customer email communications. We utilize a robust global infrastructure that includes multiple co-located data centers and public cloud resources to host our platform. In 2017, our platform was available for our customers to send email 99.995% of the time. We have invested and continue to invest to improve the reliability of our platform. Proprietary Technology and Domain Expertise Enables Effective Email Delivery
 We significantly improve email deliverability through embedded intellectual property in our platform and industry-leading domain expertise. Our platform is designed to operate at scale across multiple inbox service providers. We have over 180 domain experts in email communication supporting our technology.

Our delivery rates for 2016 and 2015 were consistent with our delivery rate for 2017. We also offer Expert Services to help our customers achieve the best outcomes for their individual needs. We estimate customers who utilize our Expert Services achieve nearly 2% higher deliverability on average, compared to our standard offering.

 Ability to Scale With Customers As They Grow
 Our communication platform provides the same high-quality service to a wide range of businesses, from startups to large enterprises, that send significant email volumes. Our Email API service starts with entry-level pricing of $9.95 that supports up to 40,000 emails per month and scales up from there. Our largest customers send more than one billion emails per month. We recognize that as our customers scale, their needs evolve, and we provide services that help them manage the complexities that emerge. Frictionless Adoption for Developers and Marketers
 We make it easy for developers and marketers to adopt our platform using a self-service model. We provide a flexible API setup to easily add email functionality to their applications which allows developers to begin sending email through our API in minutes. We have comprehensive documentation to help developers write code in their preferred development framework. We also provide 24 x 7 support to help our customers integrate with our platform. We have a community of over 2.9 million active users that serves as a resource for questions about our platform. Marketers seek the same reliable service for marketing email as developers do for transactional email. Therefore, once a business is using our API for transactional email delivery, it is simple for that business to also use our platform for promotional and personalized email marketing. Affordable and Accessible to Businesses of All Sizes
 We offer our Email API service as a monthly subscription, with pricing based on email volume. Our Email API service pricing plans start at $9.95 per month for up to 40,000 emails, providing businesses of all sizes, especially SMBs, with an affordable option for digital customer communication. Businesses can tailor the use of our services for their individual needs, without the need to commit to expensive, multi-year contracts. Our cloud-based services generally provide significant cost savings compared to an internally developed system and free up internal resources for other tasks. Based on our internal estimates and analysis, we believe a typical high-volume customer located in a major metropolitan area could save up to one-third by using our Email API service as compared to the cost of implementing and maintaining an internally-developed email delivery system. Extensible Communications Platform
 Our platform incorporates extensible technology that allows our customers to expand their use cases to improve their customer communications. We introduced our Email API service in 2009, which allowed businesses to send both transactional and marketing emails. We continued to add functionality to our platform and in late 2015, we introduced our Marketing Campaigns service. Businesses that use our Marketing Campaigns service gain more insight about how their customers interact with email, which allows the business to improve deliverability and engagement. Our customers benefit from having a single platform for transactional and marketing email, enabling them to manage their customer contact data in a single place, leverage universal design templates and testing systems, and ensure high email deliverability. Competitive Strengths
 Our competitive strengths include:
 Easy to Adopt, Self-Service Model
 Our Email API and Marketing Campaigns services are designed to be accessed from our website and immediately useable. During 2017, approximately 99% of our new customers purchased our platform through our website, without engaging with our sales team. By reducing the friction that typically accompanies the purchase of business software and eliminating the need for complicated and costly implementation and training, we believe we attract more customers to try, buy and derive value from our platform. Customers find us through our marketing efforts and word-of-mouth. This self-service model has allowed us to grow our customer base while avoiding the expensive customer acquisition costs typical of high-touch enterprise sales models. We focus on the quality of our services, frictionless adoption, and customer support in lieu of a costly traditional sales infrastructure.

 Market Leadership in Email Service with Strong Brand Association
 We pioneered the market for a cloud-based email API service and continue to invest significant resources to extend our technology leadership and brand awareness in our industry. As a result of these initiatives and our involvement in the early development of commercialized email service, we believe that the SendGrid brand has become synonymous with email delivery and is recognized as the industry standard for scalability, reliability, and deliverability. Our brand recognition is central to the efficiency of our self-service sales model. Significant Domain Expertise Around Email
 We have processed over one trillion emails since inception, including over 450 billion emails in 2017. We sent email to more than 3.9 billion unique email addresses globally during 2017. We believe each of those figures is materially larger than our closest competitor. We have longstanding relationships and integrations with inbox service providers, including Google Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, and Yahoo! Mail. These relationships provide us with real-time intelligence and performance feedback that enables us to optimize the deliverability of the emails that we send. Additionally, our personnel hold leadership roles with numerous email industry organizations including the Messaging Malware Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group, Data & Marketing Association, and Email Experience Council. Large, Growing and Happy Global Customer Base
 As of December 31, 2017, we had over 63,000 customers globally. Our broad customer base provides us with insight into digital communication trends and activity and results in word-of-mouth recognition that drives traffic to our website. We have minimal customer concentration with no customer accounting for more than 2% of revenue in any of the last three years, and a broad geographic reach with more than 36% of our revenue in the same periods coming from international regions, where we maintain limited infrastructure and no product localization. Our Growth Strategies
 Key components of our growth strategy include:
 Continue to Add Customers to Our Platform
 The market for our platform is large, underpenetrated, and growing. We believe that there is substantial opportunity to add additional customers both in the United States and internationally as the ubiquity of email and the digital transformation of businesses continue to drive market adoption of our services. Expand Platform Features and Functionality and Grow Our Marketing Campaigns Service
 Our ability to develop new applications and functionalities has been integral to our success and we intend to continue to invest to extend the functionality and range of our platform. An example of innovation includes our Marketing Campaigns service, which we launched in late 2015. Our Marketing Campaigns service has experienced strong customer receptivity, with more than 10,000 customers as of December 31, 2017. We intend to grow our Marketing Campaigns service by cross selling into our existing Email API service customer base, acquiring new customers and adding new capabilities and features. Many of our Email API service customers do not employ separate, dedicated marketing solutions and we believe that our Marketing Campaigns service offers them a highly attractive proposition. Furthermore, while we do not currently provide services in other emerging communications channels, such as messaging/chat platforms, in-app messages, online ads, browser and push notifications, and SMS, we believe that the proliferation of these channels creates further potential growth opportunities over time for us to help our customers optimize their communications across those channels. Expand our Strategic Partner Channel
 We have built and plan to continue investing in channel relationships with our strategic partners in order to broaden the reach of our internal marketing efforts. Our partner ecosystem includes strategic relationships with leading public cloud infrastructure providers and ecommerce platforms, such as Heroku, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, software vendors that offer complementary products and with which we co-sell our Email API and Marketing Campaigns services, 

 
  10

 
such as GitHub, New Relic and Twilio, and digital marketing agencies, such as Deloitte Digital, which resell our services to their clients.
 Continue to Grow Internationally
 We generated more than 36% of our revenue in each of the last three years from customers located in international geographies despite having limited international infrastructure and no product localization. We attribute this success to awareness of our services, our frictionless self-service onboarding process, and the ease-of-use of our services. Recently, we opened our first international sales and marketing office in London. In the future, we intend to add more physical infrastructure as well as localized platform content and currency, checkout, and support that will enhance our attractiveness to international customers. Pursue Select Acquisitions to Augment Our Features and Functionality
 We intend to continue pursuing acquisitions that we believe will be complementary. For example, we may pursue acquisitions that we believe will enhance our services, accelerate customer acquisition, introduce different distribution channels, and add talent and expertise to our organization. We have a track record of successfully completing acquisitions. For example, in 2015, we acquired certain assets from Message Bus, a transactional email company, and in 2017, we acquired JCKM, Inc., or Bizzy, a marketing automation company.

 Our Technology
 The technology that powers our digital communications platform combines IP and domain knowledge around email delivery, which enables us to deliver email reliably and at scale. Numerous and distinct technologies and processes go into email delivery, and it is our ability to apply these technologies across billions of daily emails and dozens of inbox service providers that truly differentiates our platform. Our technology balances the processes needed to keep bad actors who send harmful or unwanted emails off our platform with enabling reputable senders to deliver wanted mail to recipients. Constantly managing these two objectives, automatically and at scale, ensures a frictionless experience for users.
 We describe our technology differentiation across five areas:
 Ability to Process Email Efficiently
 Using a mechanism in Domain Name Servers, we have designed our mail processors to automatically route mail sent by our customers to our platform to the nearest email processing facility for optimized response times. We lease co-location space from third-party data center providers to maintain email processing facilities in four locations spread across the United States, as well as in Asia, the United Kingdom and Europe. Improving Deliverability for Reputable Senders
 Our platform is designed to capture the continuous signal provided by inbox service providers, allowing us to understand their operational responses to our email delivery techniques. Our proprietary technology relies on this continuous feedback mechanism to adjust the timing, speed and volume of email sending to optimize delivery for our customers across inbox service providers. We employ a variety of techniques to preserve the sender reputation of our customers, including warming up new IP addresses, where we systematically increase the volume of email sent from new IP addresses at a measured pace, and exponential-backoff, where we decelerate email sending quickly if the messages being sent are not well received by the target inbox service provider. We also protect our customers from actions that may inadvertently damage their ability to reach their end users. For example, our platform blocks the sending of email to end users who have unsubscribed from an email distribution list. Our Expert Services team also provides customized advice to help businesses improve their sender reputation for better deliverability. Keeping Bad Actors Off the System
 We strive to ensure that our platform is used only for sending wanted email. We continuously monitor the behaviors of users to detect unwanted email patterns. Once identified, we can reduce, suspend, or eliminate the ability of bad actors to send emails by removing them from our platform. We utilize machine learning to analyze information gathered during the sign-up process and from third parties as well as email content to determine malicious intent. These controls help us to preserve the sender reputations of our customers. Market Leading Security Architecture
 We incorporate sophisticated layers of security into our platform. We offer encrypted email to the receiver’s inbox through a Transport Layer Security connection. Our services are System and Organization Controls 2 Type II compliant. Moreover, we have implemented a broad range of advanced security technologies designed to prevent external cyberattacks and keep our internal and customer-facing systems secure. Managing Our Services at Scale
 Our technology is designed to capture, process, and react to the unique and continuous signals provided by an array of inbox service providers. We helped create the notion of a transactional email service provider. We built a global, proprietary Message Transfer Agent, which is a set of sophisticated software components that manages the distribution and delivery of email to recipients through our co-located email processing facilities. We leverage scalable cloud resources to support continuous sending during high volume periods. We maintain a high level of reliability across our email processing facilities because they operate independently from one another. If we encounter an issue at one email processing facility, we can reroute mail to another to support continuous service for our customers. Our platform also uses fair queuing 

 
  14

 
to optimize the email flow through the system so that an important message such as a password reset email is prioritized over non-critical messages going to millions of recipients.
 We intend to continue to invest in our research and development capabilities. Our research and development expense was $29.6 million, $21.2 million, and $19.0 million for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
 Our Customers
 Our scalable platform helps businesses solve some of their most important digital communications challenges. As of December 31, 2017, we had more than 63,000 customers globally using our services. We believe a relatively small number of businesses have more than one unique paying account with us, and we count each of these accounts as a separate customer. Our customers are comprised of SMBs and large global enterprises. We have a diverse customer base that spans industries. No customer accounted for more than 2% of revenue in any of the last three years. Marketing and Sales
 Marketing
 We believe the SendGrid name is synonymous with email. We rely on our brand strength and self-service, go-to-market model to acquire customers with little direct sales involvement. Because of our self-service model, we depend on businesses finding us. We invest significantly in our marketing efforts to promote our brand, attract customers, and build a community around our platform. We focus our marketing efforts on:
· | Self-Service Channel: We acquire new customers through direct response marketing, such as email marketing, search engine advertising, display advertising, social media advertising and digital sponsorships. These initiatives are designed to attract new customers to our website that will sign up for our service. We run our own demand-side platform, allowing us to directly manage our digital advertising spend and maximize the efficacy of our customer acquisition strategy. We devote significant attention to generating compelling and informative content, including an extensive library of how-to guides, best practices recommendations and comparable benchmarks. Our customer analytics supports all of these efforts, measuring the effectiveness of each component of our self-service strategy. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strategic Partner Channel: We continue to expand our relationships with leading public cloud infrastructure providers, ecommerce platforms, software vendors and digital marketing agencies to acquire new customers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Brand Strategy: Our marketing is focused on both creating awareness of SendGrid across the developer and marketer communities through advertising, content marketing, public relations, and events, and driving direct-response conversions via our self-service and partner channels. Our research and insights team continually gathers feedback from our customers to improve our targeting and ultimately the return-on-investment from our marketing activities. We established a customer advisory board to understand the changing needs of customers and to reflect those needs in our development roadmap. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Community Development: Through our Community Development team, we partner with startup accelerators, such as Techstars, incubators, and others in the startup ecosystem to provide mentorship and other support to emerging digital companies.

 Sales
 Our inside sales team responds to inbound customer inquiries and pursues targeted outbound prospects. We have a strategic focus on cross-selling our Marketing Campaigns service and Expert Services to our existing customer base. We also have a dedicated customer success team that supports larger-volume accounts and helps them grow and expand. Technical Support
 Our platform is designed to be easy to adopt and use with little support. We provide 24 x 7 support for all of our customers through our Customer Support team. Our online support services enable our customers to access documentation and instruction for our services on the Docs section of our website. We offer troubleshooting and how-to tips for all of our services, with links to all our service-specific knowledge bases. Our Competition
 We provide cloud-based services that enable businesses to reach their customers using email for both transactional and marketing purposes. The market for providing these services is fragmented, with some vendors addressing transactional email services, some vendors addressing email marketing services and other vendors providing a broad array of services that include transactional and marketing services as part of a software suite or broader portfolio of software offerings. Notwithstanding the availability of third-party software services, some businesses rely on internally-developed solutions for their email communications needs. The market for digital communications services is also rapidly evolving, creating opportunity for new competitors to enter the market with point product solutions or addressing specific segments of the market. In addition, in some instances, we have strategic or other commercial relationships with companies with which we also compete, such as Amazon Web Services. Our competitors include:

· | Companies that offer email marketing services, including Adobe, Campaign Monitor, Endurance, IBM, MailChimp, Oracle, and Salesforce.

  We believe the principal competitive factors include: completeness of offering; credibility with developers and marketers; global reach; ease of adoption; features and functionality; platform scalability, reliability, security, and performance; brand awareness and reputation; integration with third-party applications and data sources; customer support; and the total cost of deployment and ownership. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors.

 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 415 full-time employees.
         Government Regulations
 We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, taxation or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. Because global laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation. Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark protections, as well as customary contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology.

We have also registered “SendGrid” as a trademark and our pixel grid design in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and sign confidentiality agreements with third parties. We restrict access to proprietary technology and confidential information through the use of internal controls.
 Despite our efforts to protect our technology and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights and contractual protections, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and other technology.
