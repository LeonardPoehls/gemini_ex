Services to our clients are provided through the Company’s principal executive office in New York, NY, as well as in Hong Kong and China at client sites through AEC Southern UK. For marketing, we engage local agents in Shenzhen in Guangdong province, Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, Chengdu in Sichuan Province, and Shanghai in China to promote our services to potential clients, and we plan to engage more agents in China in the future.
 
Our Student & Family Services provide guidance and consulting services to help our client students and their families throughout the school application and admission process, and continuing with their studying and living needs while they complete their degrees. Beyond graduation, we can continue to help them secure suitable internships and other career development opportunities in the United States.
 
Our Student & Family Services fall into three sub-categories: Academic, Life and Career.
 
The Academic offering focuses on providing admission services for Chinese students to study in the U.S., English as a Second Language (ESL) training program, and the Elite 100 program. For middle school students, we assist in providing information on U.S. high schools. We also help high school graduates with admissions applications to U.S. colleges and universities.
 
We place ESL teachers in our representative offices in China to conduct ESL programs. Students who enroll in this program receive preparation in taking ESL tests and will obtain certificates upon successfully passing these tests.
 
AEC’s Elite 100 Program provides consulting services to talented Chinese students to enable them to reach a comprehensive understanding of American politics, business, science, education, culture and other areas. We offer academic consulting services to these top Chinese students to apply to prestigious colleges and universities in the United States. In connection with our admission services, we assist these students in arranging campus tours, writing programs, tailored ESL language programs and interview guidance. After the students are admitted into U.S. colleges/universities, we provide consulting services in connection with applications for a second major, transfers, housing accommodations, accelerated degree applications and other services. We enroll the students in seminars and events in which we partner with other business organizations, governments, non-government organizations (“NGOs”), scholars and universities to help these students build social networks and cultivate their leadership skills. We also help arrange extracurricular activities tailored for each student, such as organized artistic endeavors including dance, music, painting, photography and other performance events to enrich their cultural experience.
 
Our Life program offers consulting services, including personalized VIP services, to assist our Chinese clients to settle in the U.S. so they can focus effectively on their studies, as well as VIP services for the families of our students to visit and/or settle in the U.S. The Company refers its customers to its business partners in the U.S. to assist the customers with purchasing real estate properties, organizing their personal financial management and investment needs, buying insurance and starting businesses. These VIP services provide “concierge services” personally tailored for our clients to meet almost all aspects of their needs during their stay in the U.S. Every VIP client has an exclusive consultant to help meet his or her needs and monitors their progress along the way, so that a customized career plan can be developed taking into consideration changing conditions. VIP services include high school enrollment, college applications, medical insurance, parental travel support, housing, legal and immigration status, internship, job application and referrals to financial and real estate investment advisory firms and other related services.

Our Career program focuses on clients’ career development by identifying internship and work opportunities that are suitable to their educational background and experience level. Through this program we strive to provide clients with potential career paths, assist them in every step of the way from academic improvement to career assistance. In addition, we introduce our student customers to companies and prospective employers that may potentially provide internships and part-time or full-time work opportunities to our student customers.
Our Institutional Services assist U.S. institutions such as middle schools, high schools, and universities and colleges, to enroll students from China by establishing alliances and strategic business partnerships with colleges and universities in China. Educational institutions in the U.S. retain us to reach, market to and recruit a broad population of prospective students. Although many U.S. educational institutions are interested in attracting more students from China to diversify their student bodies, they often have a difficult time marketing to and enrolling students from China often due to lack of understanding Chinese culture and access to qualified students. We serve as an international liaison to provide marketing services to students in China. We enter into agreements with U.S. schools to market their institutions, academic programs, local environment and their students’ lifestyle on their behalf
Pursuant to our Student Exchange Programs, we recruit and enroll Chinese students in U.S. educational institutions for Exchange Programs, whereby students will finish the remainder of their education and receive their diplomas in China.
 
Pursuant to our Executive Services, via AEC New York we provide services to Chinese and other multi-national corporate clients whose executives are moving to the U.S. for work. We assist them in all aspects of relocation as well as their preparation for visa applications, as well as offering a full range of family support services. Via AEC Southern UK, we provide targeted and tailored executive training services to industrial clients in the food-related industries. From time to time, our clients request us to create customized training courses for and run the courses for their senior executives in specific areas such as regulatory compliance, human resources management, organizational management, business model development, and government relations. To provide this type of training we work with third-party vendors to design one-week or two-week training programs conforming to our clients’ specifications. We organize and arrange the training sessions, while the instructors are outsourced from our vendors.
 
Finally, our Educator Placement services are designed to meet the increasing demands for foreign teachers in both the U.S. and China. Our program helps teachers in the U.S. or China who plan to gain experience in another country find the most suitable positions. We also recruit and place native English speaking teachers for our clients and business partners in China, and recruit and place Chinese-speaking teachers in U.S. educational institutions.  In order to ensure that educators experience a smooth transition, we also provide local services to educators, which include settlement services, financial services, assistance with insurance coverage, tax services, living services, as well as business consulting services.
Growth Strategy

We intend to expand our business both organically and by acquisition.
 
Organic Growth. We may our sales efforts to create organic growth from existing clients. From our existing client base, we provide the highest level of individual services to help our clients in any way to have a smooth transition to the U.S., including visa consulting services, travel guides, life advice, investment consulting and other services. In addition, growing our existing relationships is key. Through over 17 years of continuous growth, we have built significant industry credibility and a solid reputation, which enables us to partner with quality third-party businesses in providing services to our clients when needed, which provides quality services efficiently and at a competitive cost.
Growth by Acquisition. We may grow our business through the acquisition of marketing teams and educational institutions, both in the U.S. and abroad, through a careful, gradual and targeted approach mindful of the Company’s financial resources. Our acquisition of AEC Southern and its subsidiaries that has operation in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, is the first step in the international acquisition process. Using this business as a platform for expansion, in the coming months and years we expect to enhance our educational and industrial training businesses through the addition of China-based companies and personnel in complementary areas of activity.

Industry
 
The demand for global education is growing rapidly in China, and the United States remains the top choice for Chinese students wishing to study abroad. According to a report published in 2014 by the Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China, more than three million Chinese students had studied in a foreign country.
 
The number of Chinese students entering the U.S. for study grew sharply in 2006, when Congress loosened restrictions on student visas from China for the first time since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, and this trend has continued strongly since then. Accordingly there is a large and growing number of Chinese students in the U.S. seeking a broad range of acclimation support and services, including education consulting services. We strive to become a bridge for these students with our service offerings.
 
 According to Project Atlas, a collaborative global research initiative led by the Institute of International Education, in the academic year 2015-2016, the total number international students studying in the U.S. (in both public and private institutions) was 1,043,839, of which 328,547, or 31.5%, were Chinese nationals. For the academic year 2014-2015, the comparable figures were 974,926 international students in the U.S., of whom 31.2% or 304,040 were Chinese.  This growth trend has been in place for several years. However, with the current political environment in Washington, DC regarding visas and immigration, it is not known whether it will continue in the future.
 
Moreover, the number of U.S. students studying in China, while smaller, is also experiencing steady growth. According to China’s Ministry of Education, this figure was 21,875 in 2015, the most recent available data, representing growth of over 50% over the preceding five years. The Company believes that this figure will continue to grow as well, as both the U.S. and Chinese governments have encouraged public and private programs supporting Chinese-American education exchange and cooperation.  At the top levels of government, recent communications between U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi and State Councilor Yang Jiechi have newly emphasized the crucial importance of the U.S.-China bilateral relationship in the global political and economic spheres.

Competition
 
The education consulting business in China is rapidly evolving, highly fragmented and competitive, and we expect competition in this sector to persist and intensify. We face competition from a number of companies in each of the major service segments we offer and each geographic market in which we operate, including the following:
 
Boya Elite International, based in China, offers overseas educational programs for students and executives from China.
 
The Study Abroad Foundation, an international university network based in Indiana, advises study-abroad host educational institutions on attracting international students and structuring study abroad programs according to the needs of international students.
 
Taisha.org, based in China, provides students high school/college application services including application evaluation, planning (mentor one-on-one), preparation for exams (TOEFL, GMAT, GRE, SAT, etc.), and application processing assistance. They also help students find internship and full-time job opportunities.
 
New Oriental Education & Technology Group, Inc., NYSE-listed and based in China, offers a range of educational services, including language training, test preparation, K-12 all-subjects training, international study consulting, career services for overseas returnees, global study tours, and online education.
 
Finally, several China-based enterprises offer English as a Second Language (“ESL”) preparation courses from companies that offer similar preparation courses in China.
 
With respect to the industrial executive training programs that we offer through our AEC Southern UK and its subsidiaries, we face substantial competition from local providers of similar services, including Weifang Baina Accreditation Consulting Co., Ltd, Deen (Guangzhou) Accreditation Consulting Co. Ltd,, and Zhengzhou Boda Quality System Certification Consulting Co., Ltd.
 
However, we believe that our competitors do not integrate and provide services in all of the major segments in which we operate (for students, institutions, and educators) as well as we do. We believe that our principal competitive advantages include the following:
 

· | provide one-stop integrated services to students, teachers, and institutions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | brand recognition and reputation;
--+----------------------------------


· | a business model that aligns personalized services to the specific needs of students and institutions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | overall customer satisfaction;
--+-------------------------------


· | size and coverage of service network and proximity of services to customers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | scope, quality and consistency of service.
--+-------------------------------------------

 
Our key competitive strengths lie in our individualized attention to students, our ability to place educators at top universities around the globe and specifically in the US, and our understanding of the globalization needs of top universities in recruiting both international students and faculty in an ever evolving educational landscape, with one-stop service. However, some of our existing and potential competitors may have more resources than we do. These competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion and sale of their programs, services and products and respond more quickly than we can to changes in student demands, testing materials, admissions standards, market needs or new technologies.
 
Operations
 
Since 1999, the Company has been devoted to international education exchange by providing education-related consulting services such as educational and career enrichment opportunities to students, educators and educational institutions in both the PRC and the United States. The Company’s mission is to provide “one-stop comprehensive services” to international students and their families, educators, educational institutions and corporate entities. Our services include admission applications, visa application advice, accommodations and other consulting services to Chinese students who wish to study in the United States, placement services to qualified American educators to teach and live in China, as well as U.S. relocation services to employees of multi-national companies with U.S. operations.
 
In addition to supporting AEC New York’s education consulting services, AEC Southern UK and AEC Southern Subsidiaries also provide executive services, specifically targeted and tailored executive training services in its local market. Currently we have two commercial clients in the packaged food import / export business who from time to time request from us customized training courses in specific areas such as food industry regulation compliance in various geographical regions, ISO 9001 compliance, human resources management, organizational management, business model development, and government relations. Our clients provide us with specifications as to the areas in which they wish us to provide training to their executives, whereupon we work with our vendors to design training programs for one-week or two-week or as needed, conforming to our clients’ specifications. We organize and arrange the training sessions, while the instructors are outsourced from our vendors.
 
We intend at this time to expand this business model to other, similarly regulated industries, such as food supplements and pharmaceuticals.

Marketing Strategies
 
We employ a variety of marketing and recruiting methods to attract students, institutions and teachers. By doing so, we intend to continue fostering a standard corporate identity across our education network both in China and the US.
 
We believe prospective students, institutions, and teachers are attracted to our services due to our excellent brand name, our personalized service model and the quality of our programs. We employ the following marketing methods to attract new students, institutions and teachers and retain existing customers:
 
Referrals. Our student enrollments have benefited from, and are expected to continue to benefit from, word-of-mouth referrals by our current and former customers. We believe good service combined with referrals is a steady way to grow our business and reputation.
 
Public Events and seminars. For several years we have successfully hosted the ESL (English as a Second Language) Annual Conference in China, which annually hosts over 500 attendees. The Company is planning to continue the annual conference this year. We plan to host marketing events in New York City to promote the Company’s services and brand name. In addition, the Company regularly attends higher education conferences held annually to further promote and market our services.
 
Sponsorships. We are proud sponsors of Chinese Student Associations in various higher education institutions in the Greater New York Area. We regularly promote our services to members and students of the various Chinese Student Associations and are regularly present at events held by such Associations. This is another steady source of business for us.
Marketing Materials. We plan to publish a “Chinese Visitors Guide Book”. It is planned to be a travel book with plug-in advertisements for the Company, which will assist Chinese visitors to the U.S. and simultaneously promote our services. We will also advertise in e-magazines, prepare and distribute brochures and present at exhibitions as part of our marketing strategy.
 
Media and social media marketing. We plan to develop a mobile app in the future. We plan to open a business account named “AEC Elite 100 Club” with the popular smart phone instant messenger app WeChat. “Elite U.S. Club” will be a free service platform aiming to market our company and services to potential customers. WeChat users can subscribe to our personalized VIP services through their free accounts opened with “AEC Elite 100 Club”. The subscribers will receive rebates based on their membership levels, which are based on tenure. Our members can upgrade their membership by their cumulative consumption of services available through AEC Elite 100 Club.
 
Acquisitions. Most importantly, the Company plans to further engage in acquiring other education consulting Chinese companies in our industry or our competitors in China. Mergers and acquisitions will help the Company acquire a broader additional customer base, allowing us to generate more revenue. We hope to acquire such target companies by a combination of cash payment and issuance of equity in AEC Nevada.
Government Regulation
 
Regulation of the Education Industry in the United States
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the Federal, state and local level, extensively regulate education and exchange student programs. Such regulations include, among other things, the regulations and policies of the United States Department of Education. However, unlike the systems of most other countries, education in the United States is highly decentralized, and the Federal government and Department of Education are not heavily involved in determining curricula or educational standards. The establishment and grading of such standards has been left to state and local school districts.

-

 

A more formalized regulation is the requirement that a citizen of a foreign country who wishes to enter the United States must first obtain a visa, either a nonimmigrant visa for temporary stay, or an immigrant visa for permanent residence. Foreign students must have a student visa to study in the United States. Visas generally require an application and an interview.
 
The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent substantial compliance with appropriate Federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations may require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
In addition to the regulatory approval requirements described above, we are or will be, directly, or indirectly, subject to extensive regulation of the educational industry by the Federal and state governments and the governments’ of foreign countries in which our services are provided.
 
Regulation of the Education Industry in China
 
The laws that directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate our business in the PRC include the following:
 
The principal regulations governing private education in China consist of the Education Law of the PRC, the Law for Promoting Private Education (2003). The Implementation Rules for the Law for Promoting Private Education (2004) and the Regulations on Chinese-Foreign Cooperation in Operating Schools. Below is a summary of relevant provisions of these regulations.
 
On March 18, 1995, the National People’s Congress enacted the Education Law of the PRC, or the Education Law. The Education Law sets forth provisions relating to the fundamental education systems of the PRC, including a school system of pre-school education, primary education, secondary education and higher education, a system of nine-year compulsory education and a system of education certificates. The Education Law stipulates that the government formulates plans for the development of education and establishes and operates schools and other institutions of education and, in principle, enterprises, social organizations and individuals are encouraged to operate schools and other types of education organizations in accordance with PRC laws and regulations. As such, no organization or individual may establish or operate a school or any other educational institution for profit-making purposes. However, according to the Law for Promoting Private Education, private schools may operate for “reasonable returns.”
 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations, rules or policies or any other law or governmental regulation to which we or our customers are or will be subject, or if interpretations of the foregoing changes, we and our commercialization partners may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Similarly, if our customers are found non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions.
 
Properties/Facilities
 
Our main executive office is located at 2 Wall Street, Fl. 8, New York, NY 10004. In December 2014, the Company entered into a lease for office space with an unrelated party. The lease was to commence on December 11, 2014, however, due to renovation issues, the lease was changed and commenced on March 1, 2015 and the Company received two months of free rent. This lease agreement requires a monthly rental of $29,558 and expires on July 31, 2025.

The Company leased office space from an unrelated third party for a period from March 2014, to May 31, 2016. This lease agreement required a monthly rental of $13,554, and was terminated in December 2015.
 
AEC Shenzhen leases office space from an unrelated third party for a period from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2018. This lease agreement requires a monthly rental of RMB 2,000 (approximately US$290). 
 
We believe our facilities are sufficient for our business operations.
 
Employees
 
As of the filing date hereof, the Company has 12 full-time employees, and 33 independent contractors. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
We did not have, during the periods presented, and we are currently not a party to, any off-balance sheet arrangements.
 
Seasonality
 
AEC New York typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in its revenues and results of operations, primarily due to quarterly changes in student enrollments resulting from admission seasons. AEC Southern UK does not experience substantial seasonality in its revenues.
