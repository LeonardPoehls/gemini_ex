Item 1. Business
United Community Bancorp. United Community Bancorp, Inc. is an Indiana corporation (“United Community Bancorp” or the “Company”) that was incorporated in March 2011 to be the successor corporation to old United Community Bancorp (“Old United Community Bancorp”), the former stock holding company for United Community Bank (the “Bank”), upon completion of the mutual-to-stock conversion of United Community MHC, the former mutual holding company for United Community Bancorp. The mutual-to-stock conversion was completed on January 9, 2013. As part of the conversion, all outstanding shares of Old United Community Bancorp common stock (other than those owned by United Community MHC) were converted into the right to receive 0.6573 of a share of United Community Bancorp common stock resulting in 2,089,939 shares issued in the exchange without giving effect to cash distributed for fractional shares. In addition, a total of 3,060,058 shares of common stock were sold in the subscription and community offerings at the price of $8.00 per share, including 194,007 shares of common stock purchased by the United Community Bancorp Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “ESOP”). As of June 30, 2017, United Community Bancorp had 4,205,980 shares outstanding. As a savings and loan holding company, United Community Bancorp is subject to the regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”).
 
United Community Bancorp’s business activities consist of the ownership of the Bank’s capital stock and the management of the offering proceeds it retained. It does not own or lease any property. Instead, it uses the premises, equipment and other property of United Community Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related financial data, relates primarily to the Bank.
 
Financial information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is derived in part from the consolidated financial statements of United Community Bancorp and subsidiaries on and after January 9, 2013 and from the consolidated financial statements of Old United Community Bancorp and subsidiaries prior to January 9, 2013.
 
United Community Bank. United Community Bank is a federally chartered savings bank and was created on April 12, 1999 through the merger of Perpetual Federal Savings and Loan Association and Progressive Federal Savings Bank, both located in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. On June 4, 2010, United Community Bank acquired three branches from Integra Bank National Association all of which are located in Ripley County, Indiana. At June 30, 2017, we had approximately $536.9 million in assets and $453.7 million in deposits. We operate as a community-oriented financial institution offering a wide menu of banking services and products to consumers and businesses in our market areas. Recent years have seen the expansion of services we offer from a traditional savings and loan product mix to those of a full-service financial institution servicing the needs of consumer and commercial customers. United Community Bank attracts deposits from the general public and local municipalities and uses those funds to originate one- to four-family real estate, multi-family real estate and nonresidential real estate, construction, commercial and consumer loans. Generally, fixed-rate one- to four-family residential conforming loans with terms of more than ten years that we originate are sold in the secondary market with the servicing retained. Such sales generate mortgage banking income. The remainder of our loan portfolio is originated for investment. United Community Bank also maintains an investment portfolio. United Community Bank is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) and its deposits are insured up to applicable legal limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, referred to as the FDIC. United Community Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis.
UCB Real Estate Management Holdings, LLC. UCB Real Estate Management Holdings, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Community Bank. The entity was formed for the purpose of holding real estate assets that are acquired by the Bank through, or in lieu of, foreclosure. Real estate assets held totaled $93,000 as of June 30, 2017.
UCB Financial Services, Inc. UCB Financial Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank, owns and manages a portion of the Bank’s municipal bond portfolio, and is used for the collection of commissions from a wealth management partner.
Market Areas
 
We are headquartered in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, which is in the eastern part of Dearborn County, Indiana, along the Ohio River and part of the Greater Cincinnati MSA. We currently have five branches located in Dearborn County and three branches located in adjacent Ripley County. Dearborn and Ripley Counties represent our primary deposit markets. The primary sources of loan originations are existing customers, walk-in traffic, advertising, referrals from customers and other sources, and business development efforts. We advertise on television and radio and in newspapers that are widely circulated in Dearborn, Ripley, Franklin, Ohio and Switzerland Counties, Indiana. Accordingly, as our loan rates are competitive, we attract loans from throughout these counties. The economy of the region in which our current offices are located has historically been a mixture of light industrial enterprises and services. Since the mid-1990s, the economy in Lawrenceburg has been strengthened by the riverboat casino in Lawrenceburg whose presence has supported the development of retail centers and job growth as well as an increase in housing development. Located 20 miles from Cincinnati, Ohio, Dearborn and Ripley Counties have also benefited from the growth in and around Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky, as many residents commute to these areas for employment.

Dearborn and Ripley Counties’ road system includes eight state highways and three U.S. highways. The counties have two rail lines and port facilities due to the proximity of the Ohio River.
 
Competition 
 
We face significant competition for the attraction of deposits and the origination of loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the several financial institutions operating in our market areas and, to a lesser extent, from other financial service companies such as brokerage firms, credit unions and insurance companies. We also face competition for investors’ funds from money market funds, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities. As the use of the internet has grown, we also face significant competition from financial institutions and other financial service companies across the nation and around the world with internet banking platforms. At June 30, 2016, which is the most recent date for which data is available from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), we held approximately 40.8% of the deposits held by FDIC-insured institutions in Dearborn County, which was the largest market share out of the eight financial institutions with offices in Dearborn County, and 10.9% of the deposits in Ripley County, which was the fifth largest market share out of the nine financial institutions with offices in Ripley County. In addition, banks owned by large out-of-state bank holding companies such as Fifth Third Bancorp, PNC Bank and U.S. Bancorp also operate in our market areas.
 
Our competition for loans comes primarily from financial institutions in our market areas, and, to a lesser extent, from other financial service providers such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from non-depository financial service companies which have entered the mortgage market such as insurance companies, securities companies and specialty finance companies.
 
We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered the barriers to market entry, allowed banks and other lenders to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our future growth. Nevertheless, total deposits increased $14.8 million from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2017. The deposit growth during the year is comprised of $7.8 million in retail growth and $7.0 million in municipal deposit growth.
 
Lending Activities 
 
General. We originate loans primarily for investment purposes. Historically, our primary lending activity has been the origination of one- to four-family mortgage loans secured by homes in our local market area, particularly in Dearborn, Ripley, Franklin, Ohio and Switzerland Counties, Indiana. A significant portion of this historical lending activity has been the origination for retention in our portfolio of adjustable-rate mortgage (“ARM”) loans collateralized by one- to four-family residential real estate located within our primary market area. The low interest rate environment that has persisted over the last few years has required that we augment adjustable rate originations with select 10-year fixed rate loan originations as well as select 15-year fixed loan originations. Mortgage loans with a fixed term of more than 15 years are generally sold to the secondary market with servicing retained. In order to further complement our traditional emphasis of one- to four-family residential real estate lending, significant segments of our loan portfolio consist of nonresidential real estate and land loans, multi-family real estate loans, commercial loans, agricultural loans, and consumer loans. Between 2006 and 2010, we increased and diversified our lending efforts in the metropolitan Cincinnati market area and, to a lesser extent, in Northern Kentucky and the Indiana counties outside of our local market area, particularly with respect to nonresidential and multi-family real estate lending. In June 2010, we implemented a strategy to deemphasize the origination of nonresidential real estate and multi-family real estate loans, particularly outside of Dearborn, Ripley, Franklin, Ohio and Switzerland Counties, Indiana. The strategy was implemented to address the fact that multi-family and nonresidential real estate loans, particularly those originated outside of the Bank’s traditional southeastern Indiana market area, experienced the most financial difficulty during the recent economic downturn, in turn causing the Bank to incur losses and devote an inordinate amount of management oversight to these relationships. Consequently, between June 2010 and the quarter ended December 31, 2013, our multifamily and nonresidential real estate lending origination activity outside, and to a lesser extent inside, of Dearborn, Ripley, Franklin, Ohio and Switzerland Counties in Indiana had been limited to the renewal, refinancing and restructuring of these types of loans. During the quarter ended December 31, 2013 we reviewed the economic environment in our lending markets and implemented a controlled growth strategy to prudently increase commercial and commercial real estate lending, including in the Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky markets. Starting in 2014, we hired experienced commercial lenders and credit staff to enhance our capacity to implement this strategy of prudently growing the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios.

One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Loans. We offer mortgage loans to enable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes, most of which serve as the primary residence of the owner. We offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans with terms up to 30 years. Borrower demand for adjustable-rate loans versus fixed-rate loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates, and the difference between the interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans and the initial period interest rates and loan fees for adjustable-rate loans. The relative amount of fixed-rate mortgage loans and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment. The loan fees, interest rates and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us on the basis of our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions. Most of our loan originations result from relationships with existing or past customers, members of our local community and referrals from realtors, attorneys and builders.
 
While one- to four-family residential real estate loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans. As a result of the continued low interest rate environment during the past several years, a greater percentage of our one- to four-family loan originations consisted of fixed-rate one- to four-family mortgage loans. Our practice in recent years has generally been to (i) sell in the secondary market newly originated conforming fixed-rate 15-, 20- and 30-year one- to four-family residential real estate loans on a servicing retained basis, without recourse to United Community Bank, and (ii) to hold in our portfolio fixed-rate loans with 10-year terms or less and adjustable-rate loans. At times, we have also placed select loans with a 15-year fixed term on the balance sheet. Beginning in the quarter ended June 30, 2017, after modeling the impact to our Asset/Liability profile, we began placing select mortgage loans with a 15-year fixed term on the balance sheet. This practice may change at any time, but the impact of the strategy will be monitored in conjunction with our Asset/Liability Committee meetings. In the past, we have occasionally purchased loans and purchased participation interests in loans originated by other institutions to supplement our origination efforts. At June 30, 2017, loans serviced by United Community Bank for others totaled $81.4 million, resulting in $190,000 in servicing fee income during the year ended June 30, 2017. At June 30, 2016, loans serviced by United Community Bank for others totaled $68.9 million, resulting in $164,000 in servicing fee income during the year ended June 30, 2016. During the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, we sold $23.7 million and $11.3 million, respectively, of fixed-rate one- to four-family loans. As of June 30, 2017, and 2016, we had $1.0 million and $783,000, respectively, of mortgage loans held for sale recorded at the lower of cost or fair value.
 
Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally adjust annually after an initial fixed period that ranges from one to ten years. Interest rates and payments on these adjustable-rate loans generally are based on the one-year constant maturity U.S. Treasury index (three-year constant maturity U.S. Treasury index in the case of three-year adjustable-rate loans) as published by the Federal Reserve Board in Statistical Release H.15. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased is generally two percentage points per adjustment period and the lifetime interest rate cap ranges from five to six percentage points over the initial interest rate of the loan. Our adjustable-rate one- to four-family mortgage loans generally do not provide for a decrease in the rate paid below the initial contract rate. The inability of our residential real estate loans to adjust downward below the initial contract rate can contribute to increased income in periods of declining interest rates, and also assists us in our efforts to limit the risks to earnings and equity value resulting from changes in interest rates, subject to the risk that borrowers may refinance these loans during periods of declining interest rates.

ARM loans decrease the risk associated with increases in market interest rates by periodically repricing, but involve other risks. As interest rates increase, the required periodic payments by the borrower increase, thus increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustment of the contractual interest rate is also limited by the maximum periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment permitted by the terms of the ARM loans, and therefore, is potentially limited in effectiveness during periods of rapidly rising interest rates. Decreasing interest rates could result in a downward adjustment of the contractual interest rates, subject to interest rate floor, resulting in lower interest income. At June 30, 2017, 35.7% of our loan portfolio consisted of one- to four-family residential loans with adjustable interest rates.
 
We generally do not make conventional one-to-four family real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80% without requiring private mortgage insurance. We require all properties securing mortgage loans to be appraised by a board-approved independent appraiser. We generally require title insurance on all first mortgage loans. Borrowers must obtain hazard insurance and flood insurance for loans on properties located in a flood zone before closing the loan.
 
We do not offer, and have not previously offered, subprime, Alt-A, low-doc, no-doc loans or loans with negative amortization and generally do not offer interest-only loans.
 
At June 30, 2017, we had $144.3 million in One-to four-family real estate loans outstanding, or 50.5% of total loans.
 
Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. We offer adjustable-rate mortgage loans secured by multi-family real estate. Our multi-family real estate loans are generally secured by apartment buildings within and outside our primary market area. At June 30, 2017, approximately 56.1% of our multi-family real estate loans were secured by properties located outside of Dearborn, Ripley, Franklin, Ohio and Switzerland Counties, Indiana, 100% of which were in the Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky markets. In June 2010, we implemented a strategy to deemphasize the origination of nonresidential real estate and multi-family real estate loans, particularly outside of Dearborn, Ripley, Franklin, Ohio and Switzerland Counties, Indiana. The strategy was implemented to address the fact that multi-family and nonresidential real estate loans, particularly those originated outside of the Bank’s traditional southeastern Indiana market area, experienced significant financial difficulties during the recent economic downturn, which resulted in the Bank incurring losses and being required to devote a significant amount of management’s time and energy to overseeing these relationships. Consequently, between June 2010 and the quarter ended December 31, 2013, our multi-family and nonresidential real estate lending origination activity outside of, and to a lesser extent within, Dearborn, Ripley, Franklin, Ohio and Switzerland Counties in Indiana was limited to the renewal, refinancing and restructuring of these types of loans. As part of the strategy, we amended our loan policy to reduce our concentration limits for multi-family real estate loans to 75% of the sum of tier 1 risk-based capital plus our allowance for loan losses. During the quarter ended December 31, 2013 we reviewed the economic environment in our lending markets and implemented a controlled growth strategy to prudently increase multi-family and nonresidential real estate lending, including in the Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky markets. Starting in 2014, we hired experienced commercial lenders and credit staff to enhance our capacity to implement this strategy of prudently growing the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios. At June 30, 2017, none of the nonperforming assets were multi-family residential real estate loans. For additional information regarding our troubled debt restructurings, controlled growth strategy and our multi-family residential lending, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Operating Strategy – Improving our asset quality,” “–Implementing a controlled growth strategy to originate multi-family and nonresidential real estate loans to improve interest income” and “ – Risk Management – Analysis of Nonperforming Assets.”

These loans are typically repaid or the term is extended before maturity, in which case a new rate is negotiated to meet market conditions and an extension of the loan is executed for a new term with a new amortization schedule. Our portfolio primarily includes adjustable-rate multi-family real estate loans with terms up to 30 years. Amortization periods for loans originated since 2014 typically do not exceed 25 years. Interest rates and payments on most of these loans typically adjust annually after an initial fixed term of one to seven years, with the adjustable-rate generally being based on the prime interest rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a spread, or the one, three, or five-year US Treasury index as published by the Federal Reserve Board in Statistical Release H.15, plus a spread. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased is generally two percentage points per adjustment period and the lifetime interest rate cap is generally six percentage points over the initial interest rate of the loan. Our adjustable-rate multi-family loans generally do not provide for a decrease in the rate paid below the initial contract rate. Loans are secured by first mortgages that generally do not exceed 80% of the lesser of the property’s appraised value or the purchase price, the maximum amount of which is limited by our in-house loans to one borrower limit, which currently is $6.4 million. When the borrower is a corporation, partnership or other entity, we generally require that significant equity holders serve as co-borrowers or guarantors on the loan. Environmental reports are generally required for all multi-family loans.
 
Loans secured by multi-family real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of inherent risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. A primary concern in multi-family real estate lending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow expectations of the project. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent than one- to four-family residential real estate loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor project and global cash flows on multi-family real estate loans, we typically require borrowers, co-borrowers, and guarantors to provide annual financial statements and/or tax returns. In reaching a decision on whether to make a multi-family real estate loan, we consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s character and expertise, credit history and profitability and the value of the underlying property. We have generally required that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (cash available to service debt divided by required debt service) of at least 1.20x.
 
At June 30, 2017, we had $15.4 million in multi-family real estate loans outstanding, or 5.4% of total loans. The largest outstanding multi-family real estate loan at such date had an outstanding balance of $6.5 million and is secured by multiple apartment buildings. This loan was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms at June 30, 2017. The total outstanding is a Board approved exception to our in-house limit, which was $6.4 million as of June 30, 2017.
 
Nonresidential Real Estate and Land Loans. We offer adjustable-rate mortgage loans secured by owner-occupied and non-owner occupied nonresidential real estate. Our nonresidential real estate loans are generally secured by commercial buildings. These loans are typically repaid or the term is extended before maturity, in which case a new rate is negotiated to meet market conditions and an extension of the loan is executed for a new term with a new amortization schedule. We originate adjustable-rate nonresidential real estate loans with terms up to 30 years. Amortization periods for loans originated since 2014 typically do not exceed 20 years. Interest rates and payments on most of these loans typically adjust annually after an initial fixed term of one to seven years, with the adjustable-rate generally being based on the prime interest rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a spread, or the one, three, or five-year US Treasury index as published by the Federal Reserve Board in Statistical Release H.15, plus a spread. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased is generally two percentage points per adjustment period and the lifetime interest rate cap is generally six percentage points over the initial interest rate of the loan. Loans are secured by first mortgages that generally do not exceed 80% of the property’s appraised value or the purchase price (70% for improved land only loans and 50% for unimproved land only loans), the maximum amount of which is limited by our in-house loans to one borrower limit, which currently is $6.4 million. When the borrower is a corporation, partnership or other entity, we may require that significant equity holders serve as co-borrowers or as personal guarantors of the loan. As of June 30, 2017, approximately $1.1 million, or 37.7%, of our nonperforming assets were nonresidential real estate loans.
 
In June 2010, we implemented a strategy to control the growth of our nonresidential real estate and multi-family real estate loan portfolios, particularly outside of Dearborn, Ripley, Franklin, Ohio and Switzerland Counties, Indiana. The strategy was implemented to address the fact that multi-family and nonresidential real estate loans, particularly those originated outside of the Bank’s traditional southeastern Indiana market area, experienced the most financial difficulty during the recent economic downturn, in turn causing the Bank to incur losses and devote an inordinate amount of management oversight to these relationships. Consequently, between June 2010 and the quarter ended December 31, 2013, our multi-family and nonresidential real estate lending origination activity outside of, and to a lesser extent within, Dearborn, Ripley, Franklin, Ohio and Switzerland Counties in Indiana was limited to the renewal, refinancing and restructuring of these types of loans. As part of the strategy, we amended our loan policy to reduce our concentration limits for nonresidential real estate loans to 100% of the sum of tier 1 risk-based capital plus our allowance for loan losses. During the quarter ended December 31, 2013 we reviewed the economic environment in our lending markets and implemented a controlled growth strategy to prudently increase multi-family and nonresidential real estate lending, including in the Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky markets. Starting in 2014, we hired experienced commercial lenders and credit staff to enhance our capacity to implement this strategy of prudently growing the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios. For additional information regarding our troubled debt restructurings, controlled growth strategy and our nonresidential real estate and land loans, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Operating Strategy – Improving our asset quality”, “ – Implementing a controlled growth strategy to originate multi-family and nonresidential real estate loans to improve interest income” and “ – Risk Management – Analysis of Nonperforming and Classified Assets.”

Loans secured by nonresidential real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of inherent risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Our primary concern in nonresidential real estate lending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow expectations of the project or business. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent than one- to four-family residential real estate loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor project, business and global cash flows on nonresidential real estate loans, we typically require borrowers, co-borrowers and loan guarantors to provide annual financial statements and/or tax returns. In reaching a decision on whether to make a nonresidential real estate loan, we consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise and character, credit history and profitability and the value of the underlying property. In addition, with respect to rental properties, we will also consider the term of the leases and the credit quality of the tenants. We may require that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (cash available to service debt divided by required debt service) of at least 1.20x. Environmental reports are generally required for nonresidential real estate loans.
 
We also originate loans secured by unimproved property, including lots for single-family homes and for mobile homes, raw land, commercial property and agricultural property. The interest rates charged on our land loans are typically higher the interest rates charged on our nonresidential and multi-family real estate loans due to the higher level of inherent risk. Loans secured by undeveloped land or improved lots generally involve greater risks than one- to four-family residential mortgage lending because land loans are more complex, more difficult to evaluate and require more extensive monitoring. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate or changes over time, in the event of default and foreclosure, we may be confronted with a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment. Loan amounts generally do not exceed 70% and 50% of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price for improved and unimproved land loans, respectively.
 
At June 30, 2017, we had $74.8 million in nonresidential real estate loans outstanding, or 26.2% of total loans, and $3.0 million in land loans outstanding, or 1.1% of total loans. At June 30, 2017, the largest outstanding nonresidential real estate loan had an outstanding balance of $5.6 million and was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms at that date. At June 30, 2017, our largest land loan, which was performing in accordance with its original terms at that date, had an outstanding balance of $586,000 and was secured by a commercial land development.
 
Construction Loans. We originate adjustable-rate loans to individuals and, to a lesser extent, builders to finance the construction of residential dwellings. We also make construction loans for commercial development projects, including apartment buildings and nonresidential properties (owner occupied and non-owner occupied). Our construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is typically nine months for residential properties and 12 months for commercial properties. At the end of the construction phase, the loan generally converts to a permanent mortgage loan. Loans generally can be made with a maximum loan to value ratio not to exceed 80% without private mortgage insurance on residential construction and 80% on commercial construction at the time the loan is originated. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. We also typically require an inspection and title update of the property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan.
 
At June 30, 2017, we had $5.2 million of construction loans, or 1.8% of total loans.

At June 30, 2017, our largest residential construction loan was for $441,000, of which the entire balance was outstanding. At June 30, 2017, our largest commercial construction loan relationship was for $1.7 million, of which the entire balance was outstanding.
 
Commercial Loans. We make commercial business loans to professionals, sole proprietorships, partnerships and other small businesses primarily in our market area. We extend commercial business loans on an unsecured basis and secured basis, the maximum amount of which is limited by our in-house loans to one borrower limit.
 
We also originate secured and unsecured commercial lines of credit to finance the working capital needs of businesses to be repaid by seasonal cash flows. Commercial lines of credit are typically secured by business assets or nonresidential real estate and are typically adjustable-rate loans whose rates are based on the prime interest rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a spread, and adjust monthly. Commercial lines of credit have maximum terms of one to five years, depending on the collateral. We also originate commercial lines of credit secured by marketable securities and unsecured lines of credit. Our commercial lines of credit typically require interest only payments to be paid on a monthly or quarterly basis.
 
We also originate secured and unsecured commercial loans. Secured commercial loans are generally collateralized by business assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, industrial/commercial machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures and marketable securities. We originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate commercial loans with terms up to seven years for secured loans and up to three years for unsecured loans unless there is an adequate credit enhancement to the loans such as an SBA guarantee. Term limits for larger machinery and equipment may be extended to ten years. Terms assigned to a specific loan generally will not exceed the useful life of the collateral. Adjustable-rate loans are typically based on the prime interest rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a spread, and adjust either monthly or annually. Where the borrower is a corporation, partnership or other entity, we generally require significant equity holders to be co-borrowers or guarantors on the loan.
 
When making commercial business loans, we consider the financial statements and/or tax returns of the borrower, the borrower’s payment history of both corporate and personal debt, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business, the viability of the industry in which the customer operates and the value of the collateral.
 
At June 30, 2017, we had $5.4 million of commercial loans outstanding, or 1.9% of total loans.
 
At June 30, 2017, our largest commercial loan was a $712,000 loan which was secured primarily by personal aircraft. This loan was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms at June 30, 2017.
 
Consumer Loans. We offer a variety of consumer loans, primarily home equity loans and lines of credit, and, to a much lesser extent, loans secured by savings accounts or certificates of deposit, new farm and garden equipment, new and used automobiles, recreational vehicle loans and secured and unsecured personal loans.
 
The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include an assessment of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicant’s creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount.
 
We generally offer home equity loans and lines of credit with a maximum combined loan to value ratio of 90%. Our lowest interest rates are generally offered to customers with a maximum combined loan to value ratio of 80% or less. Home equity lines of credit have adjustable-rates of interest that are typically based on the prime interest rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a spread. Home equity lines of credit have terms up to 25 years and generally require that only interest be paid on a monthly basis during the 10-year draw period then converting to principal and interest payments over the remaining 15 years of the loan. Interest rates on these loans typically adjust monthly. We offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate home equity loans. Home equity loans with fixed-rates have terms up to 10 years. Home equity loans with adjustable-rates have terms up to 30 years. Interest rates on these loans are based on the prime interest rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a spread. We hold a first mortgage position on the majority of the homes that secure our home equity loans and home equity lines of credit.

We offer loans secured by new and used vehicles. These loans have fixed interest rates and generally have terms up to 72 months.
 
We offer loans secured by new and used boats, motor homes, campers and motorcycles. We offer fixed and adjustable-rate loans for new motor homes and boats with terms up to 10 years for adjustable-rate loans and up to 10 years for fixed-rate loans. We offer fixed-rate loans for all other new and used recreational vehicles with terms up to 10 years for campers and five years for motorcycles.
 
We offer secured consumer loans with fixed interest rates and terms up to 10 years and secured lines of credit with adjustable-rates typically based on the prime interest rate as published in The Wall Street Journal with terms up to 25 years. We also offer fixed-rate unsecured consumer loans with terms up to five years. For more information on our loan commitments, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Risk Management–Liquidity Management.” At June 30, 2017, we had $33.6 million of consumer loans outstanding, or 11.8% of total loans.
 
Agricultural Loans. Originally, our agricultural loans were acquired in connection with our acquisition of the Ripley County branch offices in 2010. However, we continue to devote efforts to growing the agricultural segment of our loan portfolio due to the opportunities in our markets. Our agricultural loans generally consist of short and medium-term loans and lines of credit that are primarily used for crops, livestock, equipment and general operations. Agricultural loans are ordinarily secured by assets such as livestock, crops, equipment, or real estate and are repaid from the operations of the farm. Agricultural lines of credit generally have maturities of three years or less. At June 30, 2017, we had $3.9 million of agricultural loans outstanding, or 1.3% of total loans.
 
At June 30, 2017, our largest outstanding agricultural loan balance was $934,000, and is secured by real estate and a UCC filing on all business assets. This loan was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms at June 30, 2017.
 
Loan Underwriting Risks
 
Adjustable-Rate Loans. While it is expected that adjustable-rate mortgage loans will better offset the adverse effects of a potential increase in interest rates when compared to fixed-rate mortgage loans, the increased mortgage payments required of adjustable-rate loan borrowers in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of the underlying property also may be adversely affected in a higher interest rate environment. In addition, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans help make our loan portfolio more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits. We stress test adjustable-rate mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit during underwriting in order to assess the borrower’s ability to repay under higher interest rate scenarios.
Multi-Family and Nonresidential Real Estate and Land Loans. Loans secured by multi-family and nonresidential real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in multi-family and nonresidential real estate lending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project or business. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent than residential real estate loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor project, business and global cash flows on multi-family and nonresidential real estate loans, we typically require borrowers, co-borrowers and loan guarantors to provide annual financial statements and/or tax returns. In reaching a decision on whether to make a multi-family and nonresidential real estate loan, we consider the net operating income of the property or the repayment capacity of the business, the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability and the value of the underlying property. We have generally required that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (cash available to service debt divided by required debt service) of at least 1.20x. Environmental reports are generally required for all multi-family and nonresidential real estate loans. There is also a risk present for any adjustable-rate multi-family and nonresidential real estate and land loans in the event of rising interest rates. We stress test these loans at origination in order to assess the borrower’s ability to repay under higher interest rate scenarios.
 
We underwrite all purchased loan participations to our own underwriting standards and will not participate in a loan unless each participant has at least a 10% interest in the loan. In addition, we also consider the financial strength and reputation of the lead lender. To monitor cash flows on commercial loan participations, we require the lead lender to provide us with annual financial statements from the borrower. Generally, we also conduct an annual internal loan review for purchased loan participations.

Construction Loans. Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property’s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the building. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or before the maturity of the loan, with a property that does not have sufficient value to assure full repayment. If we are forced to foreclose on a building before or at completion due to a default, there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs.
Commercial Loans. Unlike one- to four-family mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from employment or other income, and which are secured by real property the value of which tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial loans are of higher inherent risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value.
Consumer Loans. Consumer loans may entail greater risk than do one- to four-family mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that may depreciate rapidly in value. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.
Agricultural Loans. Payments on agricultural loans are typically dependent on the profitable operation or management of the related farm property. The success of the farm may be affected by many factors outside our control and outside the control of the borrower, including adverse weather conditions that prevent the planting of a crop or limit crop yields, declines in market prices for agricultural products and the impact of government regulations. In addition, many farms are dependent on a limited number of key individuals whose injury or death may significantly affect the successful operation of the farm. If the cash flow from a farming operation is diminished, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. For loan relationships greater than $250,000, crop insurance is required at a minimum of 70% of the loan amount when the crops are the Bank’s primary collateral.
Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales. Loan originations come from a number of sources. The primary sources of loan originations are existing customers, walk-in traffic, advertising, referrals from customers and other sources, and business development efforts. We advertise on television and on radio and in newspapers that are widely circulated in Dearborn, Ripley, Franklin, Ohio and Switzerland Counties, Indiana. Accordingly, when our rates are competitive, we attract loans from throughout Dearborn, Ripley, Franklin, Ohio and Switzerland Counties, Indiana. We occasionally purchase loans and participation interests in loans to supplement our origination efforts. The networks of our lenders have also allowed us to obtain new loan business in the Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky markets in recent years. The Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky markets represent many opportunities for the Bank to continue to grow the loan portfolio.
 
We generally originate loans for our portfolio, but our current practice is to sell to the secondary market almost all newly originated conforming fixed-rate 20-, 25- and 30-year one-to four-family mortgage loans and to hold in our portfolio fixed-rate loans with 15-year terms or less and adjustable-rate loans. Our decision to sell loans is based on prevailing market interest rate conditions and interest rate risk management considerations. Loans are sold to either Freddie Mac or Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis with servicing retained.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our Board of Directors and management.
 
The Board has granted individual and aggregate loan approval authority to the Management Loan Committee, consisting of the President, the Executive Vice President, the Senior Vice President of Lending and the Chief Credit Officer. The Board Loan Committee, consisting of the President and three to four Board members, may approve loans secured by either real estate or non-real estate assets up to $3.0 million and unsecured loans up to $1.5 million. The Management Loan Committee may approve loans secured by either real estate or non-real estate assets up to $1.5 million and unsecured loans up to $500,000. Through the Management Loan Committee, the Board has also granted authority to approve consumer loans to certain employees up to prescribed limits, depending on the officer’s experience and tenure.
 
All loans in excess of these limits must be approved by the full Board of Directors.
 
Loans to One Borrower. The maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrower’s related entities generally is limited, by regulation, to 15% of tier 1 risk-based capital plus our allowance for loan losses. At June 30, 2017, our general regulatory limit on loans to one borrower was $9.6 million. On June 30, 2017, our largest lending relationship was a $6.5 million multi-family real estate loan relationship. The loan that comprises this relationship was performing according to the terms of the loan at June 30, 2017. In 2014, to reduce the risk of loss to any one borrower, the Board established a loans to one borrower limit of 10% of tier 1 risk-based capital plus our allowance for loan losses. At June 30, 2017, this limit was $6.4 million. Any relationship in excess of 10% at the time of implementation of our in-house limit was grandfathered.
Loan Commitments. We issue commitments for fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage, consumer, and commercial loans conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events. Commitments to originate mortgage, consumer, and commercial loans are legally binding agreements to lend to our customers. Generally, our loan commitments expire after 30 days.
Investment Activities
 
We have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, state and municipal governments, deposits at the Federal Reserve, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis and other financial institutions and certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions. We also are required to maintain an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis stock. While we have the authority under applicable law to invest in derivative securities, our investment policy does not permit such investments at this time. We had no investments in derivative securities at June 30, 2017.
 
At June 30, 2017, our investment portfolio totaled $189.5 million and consisted primarily of municipal bonds, agency backed mortgage-backed securities and guaranteed portions of Small Business Administration (SBA) pools.
 
At June 30, 2017, the investment portfolio contained approximately $66.2 million of callable municipal bonds. The securities generally contain a one-time call option or may be called at any time following the initial call date. Reinvestment risk is present with callable securities, particularly during periods of declining market interest rates when issuers have economic incentive to call the debt and reissue at a lower rate. The risk for the investor is needing to reinvest the proceeds from called securities into securities with lower rates.
 
Our investment objectives are to provide and maintain liquidity, to establish an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, to provide an alternate source of income when demand for deposits exceeds demand for loans and to generate a favorable return. The Investment Committee, comprised of board members, is responsible for the implementation of the investment policy. The Management Investment Committee, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Senior VP of Lending, and the Chief Credit Officer is responsible for monitoring our investment performance. Portfolio composition and performance are reviewed by our board of directors quarterly.

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds 
 
General. Deposits, borrowings, loan repayments and maturities and investment repayments and maturities are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and market conditions.
Deposit Accounts. Substantially all of our depositors are residents of the States of Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. We attract deposits in our market area from existing customers and referrals from existing customers, through advertising and through our website. We offer a broad selection of deposit products, including noninterest-bearing demand accounts (such as checking accounts), interest-bearing accounts (such as interest-bearing checking and money market accounts), regular savings accounts and certificates of deposit. Municipal deposits comprise a substantial portion of our total deposits. At June 30, 2017, $107.2 million, or 23.6% of our total deposits, were municipal deposits compared to 43.7% of total deposits at June 30, 2007. While we expect municipal deposits to continue to remain an important source of funding, we expect to continue to improve our funding mix by marketing lower cost core retail deposits, with the goal to reduce the portion of our deposit portfolio comprised of municipal deposits. Municipal deposits increased $7.0 million from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2017. During that same period core deposits increased $15.5 million. At June 30, 2017, we did not utilize brokered deposits. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the desired interest rate spread, our liquidity needs, customer preferences and rates offered by our competition. We generally review our deposit mix and pricing as needed.
Borrowings. We may utilize advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis to supplement our liquidity from deposits or to manage interest rate risk. The Federal Home Loan Bank functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for its member financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our whole first mortgage loans and other assets (primarily securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the dollar balance of advances are based on the amount of FHLB stock owned by the institution, the amount of collateral that is acceptable for pledging, or by a resolution of our board. At June 30, 2017, $8.8 million was advanced from the Federal Home Loan Bank at an average interest rate of 2.19%, and we had the ability to draw up to an additional $64.5 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank.
Personnel
 
As of June 30, 2017, we had 96 full-time employees and 21 part-time employees, none of which are represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
Subsidiaries
 
United Community Bank has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, which are United Community Bank Financial Services, Inc. and UCB Real Estate Management Holdings, LLC. United Community Bank Financial Services, Inc. manages a portion of the Bank’s municipal bond portfolio and collects commissions from a wealth management partner. UCB Real Estate Management Holdings, LLC primarily manages the Bank’s real estate acquired through foreclosure.
Regulation and Supervision 
 
General 
 
United Community Bancorp, as a savings and loan holding company, is subject to reporting to and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. United Community Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC, as its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, as the deposit insurer. United Community Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and, with respect to deposit insurance, of the Deposit Insurance Fund managed by the FDIC. United Community Bank must file reports with the OCC and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other savings institutions. The OCC and/or the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to test United Community Bank’s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements.

This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate allowance for loan losses for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC, the FDIC or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on United Community Bancorp and United Community Bank and their operations.
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) made extensive changes in the regulation of federal savings banks such as United Community Bank and their holding companies. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Office of Thrift Supervision was eliminated and responsibility for the supervision and regulation of federal savings banks was transferred on July 21, 2011 to the OCC, the agency that is also primarily responsible for the regulation and supervision of national banks. Additionally, on that date, responsibility for the regulation and supervision of savings and loan holding companies was transferred to the Federal Reserve Board, which also supervises bank holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve System. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as United Community Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the enforcement authority of, their primary regulators.
 
United Community Bank completed its conversion from the mutual holding company form of organization to the stock holding company structure in January 2013. Applicable regulations provided, among other things, that for a period of three years following the date of the completion of the conversion, no person, acting singly or together with associates in a group of persons acting in concert, could directly or indirectly offer to acquire or acquire the beneficial ownership of more than 10% of a class of United Community Bancorp's equity securities without the prior written approval of the appropriate federal banking agency. Further, as part of the approval of the conversion, the OCC required United Community Bank to maintain a charter that subjects United Community Bank to the OCC’s jurisdiction for three years following the completion of the conversion.
 
Certain regulatory requirements currently applicable to United Community Bancorp and United Community Bank are referred to below or elsewhere herein. The description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to savings institutions and their holding companies set forth below and elsewhere in this document does not purport to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on United Community Bancorp and United Community Bank and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations.
 
Holding Company Regulation
 
General. As a savings and loan holding company, United Community Bancorp is subject to Federal Reserve Board regulations, examinations, supervision, reporting requirements and regulations concerning its activities. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over United Community Bancorp and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to United Community Bank, and therefore to United Community Bancorp as its owner.
 
Pursuant to federal law and regulations and policy, a savings and loan holding company, such as United Community Bancorp, may engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act and certain other activities that have been authorized for savings and loan holding companies by regulation.

Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company from, directly or indirectly or through one or more subsidiaries, acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of another savings association or savings and loan holding company, without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board or from acquiring or retaining, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary holding company or savings association. A savings and loan holding company is also prohibited from acquiring more than 5% of a company engaged in activities other than those authorized by federal law or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings associations, the Federal Reserve Board must consider, among other things, factors such as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
 
The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings associations in more than one state, except: (1) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and (2) the acquisition of a savings association in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings association specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.
 
Capital Requirements. Savings and loan holding companies historically have not been subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. However, in July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board approved a new rule that implements the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule established consolidated capital requirements for many savings and loan holding companies, including United Community Bancorp. See “— Federal Savings Institution Regulation—Capital Requirements.”
 
Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act also extends the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The regulatory agencies must issue regulations implementing the "source of strength" policy that holding companies act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.
Acquisition of Control. Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect "control" of a savings and loan holding company or savings association. Under certain circumstances, a change in control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the company or institution, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found the acquisition will not result in a change in control. Under the Change in Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Any company that so acquires control would then be subject to regulation as a savings and loan holding company.
Dividends. The Federal Reserve Board has the power to prohibit dividends by savings and loan holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which also applies to savings and loan holding companies and which expresses the Federal Reserve Board’s view that a holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company’s bank subsidiary is classified as “undercapitalized.”
Federal Savings Institution Regulation
 
Business Activities. The activities of federal savings banks, such as United Community Bank, are governed by federal law and regulations. These laws and regulations delineate the nature and extent of the business activities in which federal savings banks may engage. In particular, certain lending authority for federal savings institutions, e.g., commercial, nonresidential real property loans and consumer loans, is limited to a specified percentage of the institution’s capital or assets.

Capital Requirements. The minimum capital level requirements applicable to the United Community Bank are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The capital adequacy rules also establish a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital and will result in the following minimum ratios: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning in January      , 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January     , 2019. An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations would establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.
 
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution’s capital level is or may become inadequate in light of particular risks or circumstances.
 
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept broker deposits. The OCC is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s degree of undercapitalization. In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution, including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. The OCC could also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. Significantly and undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional mandatory and discretionary measures.
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. United Community Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. Deposit insurance per account owner is currently $250,000. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations. Assessment rates range from 1.5 to 30 basis points of total assets less tangible equity.
 
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of United Community Bank cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.
 
Loans to One Borrower. Federal law provides that savings institutions are generally subject to the limits on loans to one borrower applicable to national banks. Generally, subject to certain exceptions, a savings institution may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of tier 1 risk-based capital plus the allowance for loan losses. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of tier 1 risk-based capital plus the allowance for loan losses, if secured by specified readily-marketable collateral.

QTL Test. Federal law requires savings institutions to meet a qualified thrift lender test. Under the test, a savings association is required to either qualify as a “domestic building and loan association” under the Internal Revenue Code or maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” (total assets less: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) intangibles, including goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed securities but also including education loans, credit card loans and small business loans) in at least 9 months out of each 12-month period.
 
A savings institution that fails the qualified thrift lender test is subject to certain operating restrictions. The Dodd-Frank Act also specifies that failing the qualified thrift lender test is a violation of law that could result in possible enforcement action for violation of law and imposes dividend limitations.
 
As of June 30, 2017, United Community Bank met the qualified thrift lender test.
 
Limitation on Capital Distributions. Federal Reserve Board and OCC regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by a savings institution, including cash dividends, payments to repurchase its shares and payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash-out merger. Under the regulations, a notice must be filed with the Federal Reserve Board 30 days prior to declaring a dividend, with a notice to the OCC. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove a dividend notice if the proposed dividend raises safety and soundness concerns, the institution would be undercapitalized following the distribution or the distribution would otherwise be contrary to a statute, regulation or agreement with the OCC. In the event United Community Bank’s capital fell below its regulatory requirements or the OCC notified it that it was in need of increased supervision, United Community Bank’s ability to make capital distributions could be restricted. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board could prohibit a proposed capital distribution by any institution, which would otherwise be permitted by the regulation, if the Federal Reserve Board determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Federal law further provides that no insured depository institution may pay a dividend that causes it to fall below any applicable regulatory capital requirement or if it is in default of its FDIC deposit insurance assessment.
 
Transactions with Related Parties. United Community Bank’s authority to engage in transactions with “affiliates” (e.g., any entity that controls or is under common control with an institution, including United Community Bancorp and any non-savings institution subsidiaries) is limited by federal law. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the capital and surplus of the savings institution. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the savings institution’s capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type specified by federal law. The purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. The transactions with affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances that are at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. In addition, savings institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary.
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by a company to its executive officers and directors. However, the law contains a specific exception for loans by institutions such as United Community Bank to its executive officers and directors as long as the loans are in compliance with federal banking laws. Under such laws, United Community Bank’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders (“insiders”), as well as entities under their control, is limited. The law limits both the individual and aggregate amount of loans United Community Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on United Community Bank’s capital position and requires certain board approval procedures to be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. Loans to executive officers are subject to additional limitations based on the type of loan involved.
 
Enforcement. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over savings institutions and has the authority to bring actions against the institution and all institution-affiliated parties, including stockholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful actions likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from civil penalties, the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist, order to remove officers and/or directors to institution of receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance. The FDIC has the authority to recommend to the Director of the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution. If action is not taken by the Director, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain circumstances. Federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations.

Federal Home Loan Bank System
 
United Community Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. United Community Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in that Federal Home Loan Bank. United Community Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank stock at June 30, 2017 of $3.5 million.
 
The Federal Home Loan Banks are required to provide funds for the resolution of insolvent savings institutions and to contribute funds for affordable housing programs. These requirements, and general adverse operating results, could reduce the level of dividends that the Federal Home Loan Banks pay to their members and could also result in the Federal Home Loan Banks imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members. If dividends were reduced, or interest on future Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased, United Community Bank’s net interest income may also be adversely impacted.
 
Federal Reserve System
 
The Federal Reserve Board regulations require savings institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) and regular checking accounts). The regulations generally provide that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: a 3% reserve ratio is assessed on net transaction accounts up to and including $115.1 million; a 10% reserve ratio is applied above $115.1 million. The first $15.5 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements. The amounts are adjusted annually. United Community Bank complies with the foregoing requirements.

Federal and State Taxation 
 
Federal Income Taxation 
 
General. United Community Bank reports its income on a fiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting. The federal income tax laws apply to United Community Bank in the same manner as to other corporations with some exceptions, including the reserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to United Community Bank. United Community Bank’s federal income tax returns have been either audited or closed under the statute of limitations through June 30, 2012. For its tax year ended June 30, 2017, United Community Bank’s maximum federal income tax rate was 34%.
Bad Debt Reserves. For fiscal years beginning before June 30, 1996, thrift institutions that qualified under certain definitional tests and other conditions of the Internal Revenue Code were permitted to use certain favorable provisions to calculate their deductions from taxable income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve. A reserve could be established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans, generally secured by interests in real property improved or to be improved, under the percentage of taxable income method or the experience method. The reserve for nonqualifying loans was computed using the experience method. Federal legislation enacted in 1996 repealed the reserve method of accounting for bad debts and the percentage of taxable income method for tax years beginning after 1995 and require savings institutions to recapture or take into income certain portions of their accumulated bad debt reserves. Approximately $749,000 of United Community Bank’s accumulated bad debt reserves would not be recaptured into taxable income unless United Community Bank makes a “non-dividend distribution” to United Community Bancorp as described below.

Distributions. If United Community Bank makes “non-dividend distributions” to United Community Bancorp, the distributions will be considered to have been made from United Community Bank’s unrecaptured tax bad debt reserves, including the balance of its reserves as of December 31, 1987, to the extent of the “non-dividend distributions,” and then from United Community Bank’s supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent of those reserves, and an amount based on the amount distributed, but not more than the amount of those reserves, will be included in United Community Bank’s taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of United Community Bank’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, distributions in redemption of stock and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. Dividends paid out of United Community Bank’s current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be so included in United Community Bank’s taxable income.
 
The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Therefore, if United Community Bank makes a non-dividend distribution to United Community Bancorp, approximately one and one-half times the amount of the distribution not in excess of the amount of the reserves would be includable in income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 34% federal corporate income tax rate. United Community Bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserves.
 
State Taxation
 
Indiana Taxation. Prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 for the Company, Indiana imposed an 8.5% franchise tax based on a financial institution’s adjusted gross income as defined by statute. Starting in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, this tax rate was reduced 0.5% per year until reaching 6.5% in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. In computing adjusted gross income, deductions for municipal interest, U.S. Government interest, the bad debt deduction computed using the reserve method and pre-1990 net operating losses are disallowed.
