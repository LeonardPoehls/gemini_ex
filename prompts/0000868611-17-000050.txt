Item 1.  Business
Overview
Sonic Corp., through its subsidiaries, operates and franchises the largest chain of drive-in restaurants (“Sonic Drive-Ins”) in the United States.  References to “Sonic Corp.,” “Sonic,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” in this Form 10-K are references to Sonic Corp. and its subsidiaries. 
The first Sonic Drive-In restaurant opened in 1953.  As of the end of our fiscal year on August 31, 2017, the Sonic system included 3,593 Sonic Drive-Ins in 45 states of which 3,365 were owned and operated by franchisees (“Franchise Drive-Ins”) and 228 were owned and operated by Sonic Restaurants, Inc., the Company’s operating subsidiary (“Company Drive-Ins”).
Sonic Corp. was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1990 in connection with its 1991 initial public offering of common stock.  Sonic is publicly traded on the NASDAQ National Market Stock Exchange (“NASDAQ”) (Ticker: SONC).
Restaurant Design and Construction
The typical Sonic Drive-In consists of a kitchen housed in a one-story building, which is approximately 1,500 square feet, flanked by canopy-covered rows of 16 to 24 parking spaces, with each space having its own payment terminal, intercom speaker system and menu board.  At a typical Sonic Drive-In, a customer drives into one of the parking spaces, orders through the intercom speaker system and has the food delivered by a carhop.  Many Sonic Drive‑Ins also include a drive-thru lane and patio seating to provide customers with alternative dining options.
Menu
Sonic maintains a highly diverse menu.  The menu strategy is to provide a broad range of items that appeal to target customer segments across different day-parts.  The menu includes a variety of traditional and healthier choices as well as creative and fun items.  Sonic’s signature food items include specialty drinks (such as cherry limeades and slushes), ice cream desserts, made-to-order cheeseburgers, chicken entrees ranging from sandwiches to boneless wings, a variety of hot dogs including six-inch premium beef hot dogs and footlong quarter-pound coneys, hand-made onion rings and tater tots.  Sonic Drive-Ins also offer breakfast items that include a variety of breakfast burritos and serve the full menu all day. 
Strategy
Sonic’s strategy is to deliver a differentiated and high quality customer service experience. The key elements of our strategy are:

• | A distinctive drive-in concept focusing on a unique menu of quality, made-to-order food products including several signature items and innovative technology;


• | A commitment to customer service featuring the quick delivery of food by friendly carhops;


• | Integrated national marketing programs across media channels, including broadcast, digital and mobile; and


• | A commitment to strong franchisee relationships.

Sonic’s brand growth strategies include the following:

• | Same-store sales growth;


• | Improved performance of Company Drive-Ins, including consistent operations execution and restaurant-level margins; and


• | Expansion of Sonic Drive-Ins.

Expansion
During fiscal year 2017, we opened 66 Sonic Drive-Ins, which consisted of 63 Franchise Drive-Ins and three Company Drive-Ins. Expansion plans for fiscal year 2018 involve the opening of multiple Sonic Drive-Ins under development agreements, as well as single-store development by new and existing franchisees.  We believe that our existing as well as newly opened markets offer significant growth opportunities over the long term.
Marketing
We have a fully integrated marketing strategy that includes a national advertising campaign.  We have designed this marketing program to differentiate Sonic Drive-Ins from our competitors by emphasizing high-quality, distinctive, made-to-order menu items and personalized service featuring friendly carhops.  We support promotions with television, radio, digital media, point-of-sale materials and other communications as appropriate.  Those promotions generally highlight limited-time products and signature menu items.
Each year, Sonic develops a marketing plan with the involvement of the Sonic Franchise Advisory Council. (Information concerning the Sonic Franchise Advisory Council is set forth on page 3 under Franchise Program -Franchise Advisory Council.) Funding for our marketing plan is provided by the System Marketing Fund, the Sonic Brand Fund and local advertising expenditures.  The System Marketing Fund primarily focuses on purchasing advertising on national cable and broadcast networks and other national media, sponsorship and brand enhancement opportunities.  The Sonic Brand Fund supports national media production as well as other programs designed to promote or enhance the Sonic brand. Our license agreements require advertising contributions of up to 5.9% of sales to these marketing funds and local advertising cooperatives. 
Purchasing
We negotiate with suppliers for primary food products and packaging supplies for the system and seek competitive bids from suppliers on many of our food and packaging items.  Approved suppliers of those products are required to adhere to our established product and food safety specifications.  Suppliers manufacture several key products for Sonic under private label and sell them to authorized distributors for resale to Sonic Drive-Ins.  All Sonic Drive-Ins are required to purchase from approved distributors.
Food Safety and Quality Assurance
To ensure the consistent delivery of safe, high-quality food, we created a food safety and quality assurance program.  Sonic’s food safety program promotes the quality and safety of all products and procedures utilized by all Sonic Drive-Ins and provides certain requirements that must be adhered to by all suppliers, distributors and Sonic Drive-Ins.  Our comprehensive, restaurant-based food safety program is called Sonic Safe.  Sonic Safe is a risk-based system that utilizes Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points (“HACCP”) principles for managing food safety and quality.  Our food safety program includes components to monitor and ensure the safety and quality of Sonic’s products and procedures at every stage of the food preparation and production cycle including, but not limited to, employee training, supplier product inspections and testing and unannounced drive-in food safety audits by independent third parties.  All Sonic Drive-In employees are required to receive food safety training, utilizing an internal training program.  This program includes specific training on food safety information and requirements for every station in the drive-in.  We also require our drive-in managers and assistant managers to pass and maintain the ServSafe® certification.  ServSafe® is the most recognized food safety training certification in the restaurant industry. 
Information Systems
Sonic Drive-Ins are equipped with information technology systems including point-of-sale systems and operational tools for sales, labor and inventory. This technology includes industry-specific, off-the-shelf systems as well as proprietary software that assist in managing food and beverage costs. These solutions are integrated with our point-of-sale systems to provide information that is important for managers to run efficient and effective operations.  We have centralized financial and accounting systems for Company Drive-Ins.  We also have systems that receive transaction-level data from Franchise Drive-Ins.  We believe these systems are important in analyzing and improving sales and profit margins and accumulating marketing information.  We are also making strategic investments in customer facing digital technologies, including interactive menu boards, a multi-functional mobile application and electronic payment at the stall to enhance the customer’s experience and drive sales. We have further invested in new point-of-sale systems. Our license agreements require a technology contribution of approximately .25% of sales to the Brand Technology Fund (“BTF”), which was established in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 and administers cybersecurity and other technology programs for the Sonic system.

Franchise Program
General.  As of August 31, 2017, we had 3,365 Franchise Drive-Ins in operation.  A large number of successful multi-unit franchise groups have developed during the Sonic system’s more than 60 years of operation.  Those franchisees continue to develop new Franchise Drive-Ins either through development agreements or single-site development.  Our franchisees opened 63 drive-ins during fiscal year 2017.  We consider our franchisees a vital part of our continued growth and believe our relationship with our franchisees is good.
Franchise Agreements.  For traditional drive-ins, the current franchise agreement provides for a franchise fee of $45,000 per drive-in, a royalty fee of up to 5% of sales on a graduated percentage basis and a 20-year term.  For fiscal year 2017, Sonic’s average royalty rate was 4.12%.  The franchisee also pays advertising fees of up to 5.9% of sales and a technology fee of approximately 0.25% of sales. 
Development Agreements.  We use single and multiple unit development agreements for opening new drive-ins.  During fiscal year 2017, almost all of our new Franchise Drive-In openings occurred as a result of existing development agreements. Each development agreement gives a developer the exclusive right to construct, own and operate Sonic Drive-Ins within a defined area.  In exchange, each developer agrees to open a minimum number of Sonic Drive-Ins in the area within a prescribed time period. Franchisees who enter into development agreements typically pay a fee, which is credited against franchise fees due when Sonic Drive-Ins are opened in the future. Franchisees may forfeit such fees and lose their rights to future development if they do not maintain the required schedule of openings. 
Franchise Drive-In Development.  We assist each franchisee in selecting sites and developing Sonic Drive‑Ins.  Each franchisee has responsibility for selecting the franchisee’s drive-in location but must obtain our approval of each Sonic Drive-In design and each location based on accessibility and visibility of the site and targeted demographic factors, including population density, income, age and traffic.  We provide our franchisees with the physical specifications for the typical Sonic Drive-In. 
Franchise Advisory Council.  Our Franchise Advisory Council provides advice, counsel and input to Sonic on important issues impacting the business, such as marketing and promotions, new products, operations, profitability, technology and training.  The Franchise Advisory Council currently consists of 26 members selected by Sonic.  We have seven executive committee members who are selected at large and 19 regional members representing all regions of the country.  We also have four Franchise Advisory Council task groups comprised of 58 members who generally serve three-year terms and provide support on individual key priorities.

Company Operations
Management Structure. A typical Company Drive-In is operated by a manager, two to four assistant managers and approximately 25 hourly employees, some of whom work part-time.  The manager has responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the Company Drive-In.  Supervisors oversee several Company Drive-Ins and supervise the managers of those drive-ins.  The employee compensation program at Company Drive-Ins for managers and supervisors is comprised of a guaranteed base compensation with additional incentive compensation based on customer satisfaction, employee turnover and drive-in level financial performance.

Competition
We compete in the restaurant industry, specifically in the segment known as quick-service restaurants (“QSR”), which is highly competitive in terms of price, service, location and food quality.  The restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer trends, economic conditions, demographics and traffic patterns.  We compete on the basis of distinctive food and service with signature food items, friendly carhops and the method of food preparation (made-to-order and personalized). Our drive-in format combined with the quality of service, featuring Sonic carhops, constitutes one of our primary marketable points of difference from the competition.  There are many well-established competitors with substantially greater financial and other resources.  These competitors include a large number of national, regional and local food service establishments, including QSRs, casual-dining restaurants and convenience stores.  A significant change in market conditions or in pricing or other marketing strategies by one or more of Sonic’s competitors could have an adverse impact on Sonic’s sales, earnings and growth.  Furthermore, the restaurant industry has few barriers to entry, and new competitors may emerge at any time.  In selling franchises, we compete with many franchisors of QSR and other restaurants, in addition to franchisors of other business opportunities. 
Seasonality
Our sales and earnings results during Sonic’s second fiscal quarter (the months of December, January and February) generally are lower than other quarters because of colder and more volatile weather in the locations of a number of Sonic Drive-Ins. 
Employees
As of August 31, 2017, we had 373 full-time corporate employees and approximately 5,800 full-time and part-time employees at Company Drive-Ins. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.  We believe that we have good labor relations with our employees. 
Intellectual Property
Sonic owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information, including the “Sonic” logo and trademark, which are of material importance to our business.  Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. Patents, copyrights and licenses are of varying durations.
Customers
Our business is not dependent upon either a single customer or a small group of customers.

Government Contracts
No portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government.
Government Regulation
Our restaurants are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local health, safety, fire and other authorities, including licensing requirements and regulations for the sale of food.  The development and construction of new restaurants is subject also to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations.  We are also subject to federal regulation and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship.  Various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs.  These laws govern minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, meal and rest breaks, unemployment tax rates, health care and benefits, workers' compensation rates, citizenship or residency requirements, child labor regulations and discriminatory conduct.  Federal, state and local government agencies have established regulations requiring that we disclose to our customers nutritional information regarding our menu items.  We have processes in place to monitor compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing our operations.
Environmental Matters
We are not aware of any federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures.  However, we cannot predict the effect on operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations.  During fiscal year 2017, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated.
