ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
Prior Business and Operations
 
Znergy, Inc. (formerly Mazzal Holding Corp., formerly Boston Investment and Development Corp), was formed in the state of Nevada on January 23, 2013.
 
The business and purpose of the Company previously was to purchase approved multi-family land, and then develop and build on said land for a profit.
 
On March 31, 2013, the Company entered into a Standard Land Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with the Mazzal Trust, pursuant to which the Company purchased property (the “Taunton Property”) consisting of “the land and all buildings thereon known as 171 Hart St., Taunton MA 02780.” The Taunton Property consists of approximately 25 acres. The Taunton Property is located in the Green Pines Townhomes subdivision, and the subdivision is managed by the Green Pines Townhomes Condominium Trust. (The manager of the Green Pines Townhomes Condominium Trust is Green Pines, LLC, a shareholder of the Company, the manager of which is Marty Trabelsi, the brother of Nissim Trabelsi, the Company’s President.) The purchase price for the Taunton Property was 1,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. On May 29, 2013, the purchase of the Taunton Property closed, and the seller delivered the deed, and the Company issued the shares.

Global ITS Transaction
 
On October 26, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Global ITS, Inc. (“Global”), a development stage company and the shareholders of Global, pursuant to which the Company exchanged 120,000,000 of its common shares (the “Company Shares”) for 24,000,000 Global common shares held by Global’s shareholders representing 100% of Global’s outstanding shares (the “Share Exchange”).
  
Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company became the sole shareholder of Global, and became obligated to issue 120,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Global, a privately held Wyoming development stage corporation, was focused on marketing energy efficiency (“EE”) and commercial security (“CS”) products. Its wholly owned subsidiary, Znergy, Inc., a Florida corporation (“Znergy-FL)”), was focused on financing EE and CS projects for Global’s customers and for third party projects.  Subsequently, Znergy-FL has become the operating subsidiary for the Company, selling and installing energy efficient lighting.
 
Global intends to grow organically by selling EE and CS products to industrial and commercial businesses as well as municipal and state governments, universities and colleges, K-12 schools, and hospitals (the “MUSH” market). Strained government budgets have convinced state and local governments across the United States to embrace a new form of performance-based investments in energy efficiency offered by Energy Services Companies, or ESCOs. An ESCO provides energy-efficiency-related and other value-added services and for which performance contracting is a core part of its energy-efficiency services business. In a performance contract, the ESCO guarantees energy or financial savings for the project, which means ESCOs only make money if the project performs as promised. The total energy management services market – which includes ESCOs – will approach $50 billion by 2017, according to a new research report by Verify Markets.
 
Znergy increases the Company’s competitive position by providing funding for EE projects through its strategic partnership with a well established funding group focused on energy efficiency projects.
 
In addition, the Company will look for accretive acquisitions in the diverse and fragmented EE marketplace.

Change in Control Transaction
 
On November 19, 2015, Mr. Trabelsi, who was serving at the time as the Company’s President and CEO, entered into a binding term sheet (the “Term Sheet”) to sell 100% of his shares of the Company’s common stock to Peter Peterson or entities designated by him for an aggregate purchase price of $500,000, minus certain expenses to be paid prior to closing. Additionally, the Mazzal Trust (the “Trust”), the Company’s largest shareholder, agreed to return to the Company 150,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, in exchange for which the Company will transfer all right, title, and interests in and to the Company’s real property located in Taunton, Massachusetts (the “Taunton Property”), to the Trust.
 
Subsequently, on February 9, 2016, following additional negotiations between the parties, the Company, Mr. Trabelsi; Shawn Telsi (a significant shareholder); the Mazzal Living Trust, the majority shareholder of the Company (the “Trust”); and B2 Opportunity Fund, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“B2”), entered into an Amended Master Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Master Agreement”).
 
Pursuant to the Master Agreement, Mr. Trabelsi and Mr. Telsi each agreed to sell 100% of the shares of the Company’s common stock owned by them to B2 or its designees. Mr. Trabelsi sold 45,800,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, and Mr. Telsi sold 9,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The aggregate purchase price paid for the 55,300,000 shares was Three Hundred Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($315,000).

In connection with the Master Agreement, the Company agreed to sell to the Trust, and the Trust agreed to purchase from the Company, real property which the Trust had previously sold to the Company, described above as the Taunton Property. Additionally the Company’s subsidiary, Command Control, sold the Hotel Property (collectively with the Taunton Property, the “Property”).  As consideration for the purchase of the Property, the Trust returned to the Company 149,950,000 of the 150,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock owned by the Trust, while retaining 50,000 of the shares.
 
In connection with the execution of the Master Agreement, the Company canceled the 149,950,000 shares of common stock conveyed by the Trust.

New Director; New Officer; Resignation of Mr. Trabelsi
 
In connection with his sale of his and Mr. Telsi’s shares, Mr. Trabelsi appointed Christopher J. Floyd to the Board of Directors of the Company, Mr. Trabelsi also appointed Mr. Floyd as the CEO, CFO, and Secretary of the Company.  Following Mr. Trabelsi’s appointment of Mr. Floyd to the board of directors and as an officer of the Company, Mr. Trabelsi resigned from all positions with the Company, effective immediately.  Mr. Floyd, as the Company’s remaining director, accepted the resignations.
 
There were no disagreements or disputes between Mr. Trabelsi and the Company or the Board of Directors.
 
A copy of Mr. Trabelsi’s notice of resignation was included as an exhibit to the Company’s Current Report filed on February 12, 2016.  The Company provided to Mr. Trabelsi a copy of the Current Report for his review prior to filing.
 
Change in Control
 
In connection with the Master Agreement and the cancellation of the Trust’s shares in connection with the sale of the Property, a change of control of the Company occurred.
 
As noted above, in October 2015, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Global and the shareholders of Global ITS, pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Global ITS. The Global ITS shareholders tendered their shares of Global ITS common stock in exchange for which the Company has a contractual obligation to issue 120,000,000 shares of its Common Stock to the shareholders of Global ITS.  Following their issuance, the 120,000,000 shares represented in the aggregate approximately 36% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company.
 
Immediately prior to the execution of the Master Agreement, the Company had 330,000,000 common shares issued and outstanding. Mr. Trabelsi, through his personal ownership and as Trustee of the Trust, beneficially owned approximately 60% of the outstanding shares.
 
As noted above, in connection with the Master Agreement discussed above, Mr. Trabelsi sold his shares of common stock to B2 or its designees, and the Trust agreed to purchase the Properties from the Company in exchange for 149,950,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, which were canceled by the Company following the closing of the transaction. As such, following the closing of the Master Agreement, the Company had 180,050,000 shares issued and outstanding. As of the date of this Report, to our knowledge, Mr. Trabelsi owned indirectly, through the Trust, 50,000 shares of the Company’s common stock.
 
The Global ITS holders, as a group, hold shares representing approximately 67% of the total issued and outstanding shares. B2’s designee, Lone Cypress LLC, owns shares representing approximately 26.7% of the outstanding common stock.
 
As such, a change of control of the Company occurred in connection with the execution of the Master Agreement and the cancellation of the Trust’s shares. As noted, the Global ITS shareholders tendered their shares of Global ITS common stock in exchange for the shares of the Company’s common stock.
 
Global ITS has approximately 50 shareholders, including Lone Cypress, LLC. Following the distribution of Company’s shares to the Global ITS shareholders, none of the former Global ITS shareholders owned 10% or more of the Company’s shares other than Lone Cypress, which received an aggregate of 41,137,120, which was equal to approximately 23% of the total outstanding shares of the Company.
 
Financing Strategy
 
The Company anticipates that it will finance its operations, at least initially, through the sale of its shares of common stock, which will result in dilution to the current owners of our shares of common stock, and through future business acquisitions. There can be no guarantee, however, that should we embark upon a strategy to sell our equity securities or make business acquisitions that such offering or acquisitions will be successful in providing the Company with sufficient capital to implement its business plan.

Competition
 
The energy efficiency segment for small and medium sized commercial businesses is fragmented and highly competitive. The Company competes with various types and sizes of companies ranging from local and national service providers.
 
The efficient lighting market, which is part of the energy efficiency market, is also highly competitive, with some of the largest suppliers of lighting components also serving many of the same markets and competing for the same customers. Competition is based on numerous factors, including features and benefits, brand name recognition, product quality, product and lighting system design, energy efficiency, customer relationships, service capabilities, and price. The Company’s largest competitors in the North American lighting market include the lighting divisions of Acuity Brands, Koninklijke Philips N.V., Eaton Corporation, Hubbell Incorporated, Schneider Electric, Cree, Inc., and General Electric Company. The Company estimates that the largest publicly traded manufacturers, which participate in varying degrees in the North American lighting market, have over half of the total market share. In addition to these large competitors, the Company also competes with hundreds of manufacturers of varying size.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, we had six employees. The Company has recently commenced operations and generated revenue. As such, we rely substantially on the services of Mr. Floyd, who serves as both Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Baker, our Chief Operating Officer, to set up and grow our business operations.
Employment Agreements
 
We have one employment agreement with Dave Baker, our Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Baker’s agreement, dated September 28, 2016, has a term of three years, specifies an annual base salary of $100,000 which salary will be reviewed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors by April 15, 2017 and annually thereafter, a signing bonus of $10,000 and a bonus in January 2017 equal to 6% of the total revenue generated by Mr. Baker in the fourth quarter of 2016 which bonus was paid on January 20th, 2017 in the amount of $10,928 (6% of $182,127). In addition, Mr. Baker was granted 500,000 shares of common stock of the Company, vested immediately, and was granted 5,000,000 options to purchase common stock of the Company at $0.10 per share (the “Options”). The Options have a three-year expiration and vest one option for every two dollars of revenue recognized by the Company.  On December 1, 2016, Mr. Baker was promoted from Senior Vice President to Chief Operating Officer and granted a further 4,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, which vested immediately.
Board Committees
 
The Board formed its Compensation Committee in January 2017 comprising Mr. Fillmore and Mr. Mikles serving as Chairman and member of the Committee, respectively.  We are seeking and expect to appoint a fifth independent member of the board who meets the requirements as an “audit committee financial expert” in accordance with applicable SEC regulations and to form our Audit Committee at that time although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or recruiting such a candidate.
Directors
 
The maximum number of directors the Company is authorized to have is nine. However, in no event may the Company have fewer than one director. Currently, the Company has four board members; three independent directors, Rick Mikles (Chairman), Art Fillmore (director and General Counsel), Kevin Harrington (director); and one employee director, Christopher Floyd (director and Chief Executive Officer).  We are seeking and expect to appoint a fifth independent member of the board who meets the requirements as an “audit committee financial expert” in accordance with applicable SEC regulations.
Director Compensation
 
None.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
