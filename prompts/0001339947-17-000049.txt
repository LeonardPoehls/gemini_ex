OVERVIEW
Viacom is home to premier global media brands that create compelling entertainment content - including television programs, motion pictures, short-form content, games, consumer products, podcasts, live events and social media experiences - for audiences in more than 180 countries on various platforms and devices. We operate through two reportable segments: Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment, each of which is described below.
In fiscal year 2017, following a comprehensive review of our operations and performance, we began to execute against a new business strategy that is built on the following key pillars:

• | We have designated key brands - Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., MTV, BET, Comedy Central and Paramount - as our highest priority, “flagship” brands. Our flagship brands are unique from our other brands, in that they have compelling, valuable and distinct brand propositions; serve diverse, substantial audiences with content largely owned by us; and have global reach and distribution potential across linear, digital, film, consumer products, and live events and experiences. We have also focused on opportunities to bring the best of Paramount Pictures to our Media Networks business, and the best of our Media Networks business to Paramount Pictures.


• | We are elevating our approach to content and talent, by building our content pipeline and embracing new formats. We are working to transform our approach to talent development by creating new opportunities for our key talent across our networks and film studio.


• | We are deepening our partnerships to drive new distribution and advertising revenue, including through advanced advertising, data, marketing and co-production agreements.


• | We are extending the reach of our brands in both the physical world (through live events, recreation and similar experiences) and the digital world.


• | We are optimizing and energizing our organization, by focusing on our culture and shared vision and values.

We were organized as a Delaware corporation in 2005 in connection with our separation from CBS Corporation (“CBS”), which was effective January 1, 2006. Our principal offices are located at 1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036. Our telephone number is (212) 258-6000 and our website is www.viacom.com.

MEDIA NETWORKS

Media Networks Revenues
Our Media Networks segment generates revenues in three categories: (i) the sale of advertising and marketing services, (ii) affiliate fees from distributors of our programming and program services and (iii) ancillary activities such as consumer products. In fiscal year 2017, advertising revenues, affiliate revenues and ancillary revenues were approximately 48%, 46% and 6%, respectively, of total revenues for the Media Networks segment.
Revenues from the Media Networks segment accounted for 76%, 79% and 78% of our revenues for the fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, after the elimination of intercompany revenues.
Advertising Revenues
Our Media Networks segment generates revenues from the sale of advertising and from marketing services. Our advertising revenues generally depend on the number of viewers and viewership demographics. Demand and pricing for our advertising depend on the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers, viewership and overall market conditions.
Ratings and demographic information for advertising purposes are determined by third-party research companies such as The Nielsen Company (US), LLC (“Nielsen”) and comScore, Inc. (“comScore”), sometimes also including third- and first-party data.
Our Media Networks properties appeal to various key audiences attractive to advertisers. For example, MTV appeals to teens and young adults, Nickelodeon appeals to kids and their families and BET appeals to African-American audiences. We also drive additional demand through integrated sales of multi-platform advertising and marketing opportunities and through our integrated marketing services, providing unique branded entertainment and custom sponsorship opportunities to our advertisers.
Domestically, we sell a certain amount of our advertising inventory in advance each year in the upfront market, and other inventory in the scatter market closer to the time a program airs. Upfront sales and pricing for each new cable broadcast year are largely established in our third fiscal quarter and reflected in advertising revenue principally beginning in the first quarter of our subsequent fiscal year as marketing plans are finalized and orders are fulfilled to deliver advertising across various programs and dayparts. Pricing for advertising within our programming is generally established based on projected impression delivery, which may be guaranteed on a fixed price per impression unit basis. For advertising sold based on impression guarantees, audience deficiency may result in an obligation to deliver subsequent additional units, reducing inventory available 
8

for scatter sales. Scatter advertising is sold throughout the year at pricing reflecting market conditions at the time of sale and customization of services delivered. Most scatter advertising is also sold based on impression guarantees. To the extent we do not satisfy contracted audience ratings, we record deferred revenue until such time that the impression guarantee has been satisfied.
Internationally, advertising markets vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; however, we do not typically sell our inventory in advance in an upfront market. The majority of our international inventory is sold in the equivalent of the U.S. scatter market, and in a number of markets we are represented by third-party sales houses. The terms of these relationships vary. For example, in the UK, which is our largest market outside the U.S., we are represented by a third party to whom we sell the inventory on our television channels in the form of commercial impacts at a price calculated in accordance with a pre-agreed pricing metric, and the third party then resells those impacts to UK agencies and advertisers. In Argentina, our inventory is sold to advertisers either directly or through advertising agencies.
Our advertising revenues may be affected by the strength of advertising markets and general economic conditions, and may fluctuate depending on the success of our programming, as measured by viewership, at any given time. Measured viewership may vary due to the success of our programming (due to, among other things, the timing of availability of new episodes of popular programming and the performance of competing programs and other entertainment alternatives for viewers), the platforms on which our programming is available, as well as variations related to the methods used by third parties to measure viewership. Advertising revenues may also fluctuate due to seasonal variations, the timing of holidays and significant programming events such as awards shows and premieres. Typically, advertising revenues are highest in the first quarter of our fiscal year.
We continue to invest in proprietary data platforms and advanced analytics that enable our customers to better target and measure the impact of their advertising. Our Viacom VantageTM platform combines data from multiple sources, which may include both first- and third-party data, in a predictive environment to deliver enhanced consumer targeting and campaign measurement. Viacom VelocityTM is our branded content agency offering full-service marketing that seamlessly integrates clients’ brands into custom content across our platforms. Customized programs and proprietary analytics provide a strategic perspective on engagement across multiple social platforms including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat and Tumblr.
In fiscal year 2017, Viacom created a consortium with Fox Networks Group and Turner to form OpenAP, the television industry’s first open platform for cross-publisher audience targeting, enabling advertisers and agencies to define and customize the audiences they want to reach across member networks, with consistent standards of measurement and independent third party posting for advertising campaigns.
We are also working with distributors of our programming to evolve our multi-platform advertising offerings to include targeting and customization through Vantage, Velocity and OpenAP.
Affiliate Revenues
Our affiliate revenues are generated through fees from distributors of our programming and program services, such as cable television operators, direct-to-home satellite television operators, mobile networks and subscription video-on-demand and other OTT services.
Our agreements with multichannel television service providers are generally multi-year carriage agreements with set rate increases. The amount of fees we receive is generally a function of the number of subscribers and the rates we receive per subscriber. Expirations of these affiliate agreements are staggered. We are also working with these distributors to create new and improved pay television revenue opportunities.
Under subscription video-on-demand and other similar OTT agreements, we make certain programs available for distribution on one or more dates, and our revenue under these OTT agreements is recognized upon the availability of the programs licensed; therefore, revenue will fluctuate depending on the timing of when programming is made available throughout the license period.
Ancillary Revenues
Our Media Networks ancillary revenues are principally derived from (i) our consumer products activities, which include licensing our brands and intellectual property, as well as creation and publishing of interactive games across various platforms (including mobile, PC and console), (ii) recreational experiences and live events, (iii) viewing of our programming through electronic sell-through and download-to-rent services and the sale of DVDs and Blu-ray discs and (iv) television syndication of our content.
9

Our ancillary revenues vary based on consumer spending, the popularity of our programming, the volume of content available during a particular period and acceptance of our and our partners’ products.
Media Networks Competition
Our media networks generally compete with other widely distributed cable networks, the broadcast television networks and digital programming services and platforms. Our media networks compete for advertising revenue with other cable and broadcast television networks, social media platforms, other connected outlets such as websites, apps and other online experiences, radio programming and print media. Each programming service competes for audience share with competitors’ programming services that target or include the same audience. For example, Nickelodeon’s programming and services compete for younger viewers, and BET’s programming and services compete for consumers of African-American culture, with other entertainment services, including cable and broadcast networks, digital distribution outlets and other content platforms. We also compete with other cable networks for affiliate fees and distribution. Our networks compete with other content creators for directors, actors, writers, producers and other creative talent and for new program ideas and the acquisition of popular programming. Competition from these sources may affect our revenues and costs.
FILMED ENTERTAINMENT
Overview
Our Filmed Entertainment segment develops, produces, finances, acquires and distributes motion pictures, television programming and other entertainment content under the Paramount Pictures®, Paramount PlayersTM, Paramount Animation® and Paramount TelevisionTM divisions, in various markets and media worldwide, for itself and for third parties. It partners on various projects with key Viacom franchises, including Nickelodeon Movies and MTV Films.

In June 2017, we announced the establishment of Paramount Players, a new production division that aims to expand Paramount’s slate of films by partnering with our Media Networks flagship brands to develop, produce and market distinctive feature films in order to bring more of our leading brands to movie audiences around the world. These co-branded films will be distributed by Paramount with a unique emphasis on marketing campaigns and integrations benefiting from the global reach of our flagship networks. Paramount Players will also focus on smaller budget films reflecting specific genres and target audiences.
Paramount Animation is focused on creating high-quality animated films and has various projects in production and development, including upcoming releases Sherlock Gnomes and Amusement Park. Amusement Park is a feature film expected to be released in 2019, to be followed by an Amusement Park television series on Nickelodeon. Going forward, we anticipate that Paramount Animation will release one to two animated films per year.
Motion pictures produced, acquired and/or distributed by the Filmed Entertainment segment are generally first exhibited theatrically in domestic and/or international markets and then released in various markets through electronic sell-through, DVDs and Blu-ray discs, transactional video-on-demand, subscription video-on-demand, pay television, cable television and free television, free video-on-demand and by airlines and hotels.

Paramount expects its total film slate to include approximately 10 theatrical releases in fiscal year 2018 as it continues to rebuild its film slate under its new divisions.
Paramount Television draws on Paramount’s extensive library of film properties and develops original programming for television and digital platforms. In fiscal year 2017, Paramount Television produced Shooter, 13 Reasons Why and Berlin Station. Paramount Television also has various other programs in production, including The Alienist for TNT, Jack Ryan for Amazon, and Maniac and The Haunting for Netflix, as well as School of Rock (produced by Nickelodeon), 3 Days of the Condor (produced by DirecTV) and Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events (produced by Netflix). In addition, it has 
10

numerous projects in development. Paramount Television’s first project, 2016’s live television event Grease Live, received 10 Emmy nominations, winning five.
Motion Picture Production, Distribution and Financing
 
Paramount produces many of the motion pictures it releases and also acquires films for distribution from third parties. In some cases, Paramount co-finances and/or co-distributes films with third parties, including other studios. Paramount also enters into film-specific financing and slate financing arrangements from time to time under which third parties participate in the financing of the costs of a film or group of films, typically in exchange for a partial copyright interest. Paramount distributes motion pictures worldwide or in select territories or media, and may engage third-party distributors for certain pictures in certain territories.
Paramount has recently extended and expanded its relationship with Skydance, a producer and co-financier of many Paramount motion pictures. The new agreement extends to 2022 and includes a Paramount “first look” for projects initiated by Skydance, including smaller budget and animated projects.
In November 2017, Paramount Pictures and Hasbro, Inc. (“Hasbro”) announced a new exclusive agreement to produce and distribute content based on Hasbro’s expansive list of brands, as well as original stories. Paramount and Hasbro will partner on live action and animated films, with Hasbro’s Allspark Pictures and Allspark Animation having a role in development and production. The agreement expands the companies’ existing relationship, under which Paramount and Hasbro have partnered on five Transformers films, two G.I. Joe films and the first Transformers spinoff - Bumblebee - which is scheduled for theatrical release in December 2018.
Domestically, Paramount generally performs its own marketing and distribution services for theatrical releases and its own sales and marketing services for home entertainment releases. Paramount has an agreement with Universal Studios for certain back-office and distribution services for all physical DVD and Blu-ray discs released by Paramount in the U.S. and Canada. Paramount also distributes CBS’s library of television and other library content on DVD and Blu-ray disc on a worldwide basis under an agreement that runs through 2020.
Internationally, Paramount, through its international affiliates, generally distributes its theatrical releases through its own distribution operations or, in some territories, through United International Pictures, a company that Paramount and Universal Studios own jointly. For home entertainment releases, Paramount’s physical DVD and Blu-ray discs are distributed in certain international territories by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment and in certain other territories by Paramount licensees.
Paramount also distributes films domestically and internationally on electronic sell-through, transactional video-on-demand, subscription video-on-demand and television platforms. In the first domestic pay television distribution window, Paramount’s feature films initially theatrically released in the U.S. are generally exhibited on EPIX, a multi-platform premium entertainment service that offers Paramount, MGM, Lions Gate Films and certain third-party films, as well as original content, through a premium pay television channel and television and digital subscription video-on-demand services.
Producing, marketing and distributing motion pictures and television programming can involve significant costs. The timing of a motion picture’s release can also cause our financial results to vary. For example, marketing costs are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other distribution windows, and are expensed as incurred. As a result, we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film’s theatrical exhibition, and recoupment of investment as well as profitability for the film may not be realized until well after its theatrical release. Therefore, the results of the Filmed Entertainment segment can be volatile as films work their way through the various distribution windows.
Filmed Entertainment Revenues
Our Filmed Entertainment segment generates revenues in four categories: (i) the release and/or distribution of motion pictures theatrically, (ii) the release and/or distribution of film and television product through home entertainment, (iii) the licensing of film and television product to television and digital platforms and (iv) other ancillary activities. In fiscal year 2017, theatrical 
11

revenues, home entertainment revenues, licensing revenues and ancillary revenues were approximately 25%, 26%, 40% and 9%, respectively, of total revenues for the Filmed Entertainment segment.
Revenues from the Filmed Entertainment segment accounted for 24%, 21% and 22% of our revenues for the fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, after the elimination of intercompany revenues.
Theatrical Revenues
Paramount generates revenues worldwide from the theatrical release and/or distribution of motion pictures, primarily from audience ticket sales. In addition to the traditional 2D format, certain of Paramount’s theatrical releases are made available in 3D and/or IMAX format, tickets that are generally sold at premium pricing.
Each motion picture is a separate and distinct product with its revenues, and ultimate profitability, dependent upon many factors, among which audience response, domestically and internationally, is of fundamental importance. Theatrical revenues may also be affected by the number, timing and mix of releases and competitive offerings in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits, and overall economic conditions, including trends in discretionary spending. The theatrical success of a motion picture is a significant factor in determining the revenues it is likely to generate in home entertainment markets and licensing arrangements for television and other platforms. Revenues from motion picture theatrical releases tend to be cyclical with increases around the holidays that fall during the first quarter of our fiscal year, and in the summer months during our fourth quarter.
In fiscal year 2017, Paramount theatrically released in domestic and/or international markets Transformers: The Last Knight, Arrival, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, Baywatch, Fences, Office Christmas Party, xXx: The Return of Xander Cage, Ghost in the Shell, Allied, Monster Trucks, Rings, mother!, Silence and An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power. In addition to Daddy’s Home 2, which was released in November 2017, Paramount’s fiscal year 2018 slate is expected to include Downsizing, Sherlock Gnomes and Mission: Impossible 6.
Home Entertainment Revenues
Home entertainment revenues are derived from the worldwide sales and distribution of DVDs and Blu-ray discs relating to the motion pictures released theatrically by Paramount and programming of other Viacom brands such as Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central and BET, as well as certain acquired films and content distributed on behalf of third parties such as CBS. Home entertainment revenues are also derived from the viewing of our films on a “transactional” basis through transactional video-on-demand and electronic sell-through services around the world, for a fee and/or on a revenue-sharing basis. 
Our home entertainment revenues may be affected by the number, timing and mix of releases and competitive offerings in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits, the prominence given by distributors and retailers to our releases compared to those of our competitors, and overall economic conditions, including trends in discretionary spending.
Key home entertainment releases in fiscal year 2017 included Star Trek Beyond, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, Arrival, xXx: The Return of Xander Cage, Ghost In The Shell, Transformers: The Last Knight, Fences, Allied, Baywatch, Monster Trucks and Office Christmas Party.
Licensing Revenues
Paramount generates fees by licensing, around the world on a territory by territory basis, films and television programs produced, acquired or distributed by Paramount, for a fee or on a revenue-sharing basis, to subscription video-on-demand, pay and basic cable television, free television and free video-on-demand services.
Revenue from the licensing of film and television exhibition rights is recognized upon availability for airing by the licensee and will fluctuate depending on the number and mix of available titles in any given territory.
Licensing revenues in fiscal year 2017 were generated from films that were licensed to various platforms, including Star Trek Beyond, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, xXx: The Return of Xander Cage, Allied and Arrival, and from distribution of Paramount Television titles including Shooter, 13 Reasons Why and Berlin Station.
Ancillary Revenues
Paramount generates ancillary revenues by providing production and facilities services to third parties, primarily at Paramount’s studio lot. Paramount also generates ancillary revenues by licensing its brands for consumer products, themed restaurants, hotels and resorts, live stage plays, film clips and theme parks and other location-based entertainment projects.

Filmed Entertainment Competition
Our Filmed Entertainment segment competes for audiences for its motion pictures, television programming and other entertainment content with the motion pictures and content released by other major motion picture studios, independent film producers and television producers, as well as with other forms of entertainment and consumer spending outlets. Our competitive position primarily depends on the amount and quality of the content produced, its distribution and marketing success and public response. We also compete for creative talent, including producers, actors, directors and writers, and scripts for motion pictures, all of which are essential to our success. Our motion picture brands also compete with studios and other producers of entertainment content for distribution of motion pictures through the various distribution windows (such as television and home entertainment) and on digital platforms. Competition from these sources may affect our revenues and costs.

Paramount’s Kindergarten to Cap & Gown
Paramount has a long and proud tradition of giving back with a corporate social responsibility program focused on four key initiatives: supporting public education; protecting the environment; combating HIV/AIDS; and promoting volunteerism. By offering employee engagement opportunities, coupled with financial and in-kind contributions, Paramount supports numerous local, national, and global non-profit organizations. Kindergarten to Cap & Gown - Paramount’s signature education program - mentors students through their educational experience, targeting four partner schools in Paramount’s Los Angeles neighborhood.
Viacommunity’s Talent for Good
At Viacommunity, one of the best ways to leverage the power of the Viacom brands and give back to the communities we serve is through the unique expertise of our creative and talented employees. Through this skills-based volunteering program, employees can strengthen their skills and build new ones, while giving back to the causes they care about most.
REGULATION AND PROTECTION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We are, fundamentally, a media content company, so the trademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property laws that protect our brands and entertainment content are of paramount importance to us. Our businesses and the intellectual property 
14

they create or acquire are subject to and affected by laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities, as well as laws and regulations of countries other than the U.S. and pan-national bodies such as the European Union (“EU”). The laws and regulations affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change as are the protections that those laws and regulations afford us. The discussion below describes certain, but not all, present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses.
Certain Regulations Affecting Our Business
Children’s Programming
Our business is subject to various regulations, both in the U.S. and abroad, applicable to children’s programming. For example, since 1990, federal legislation and rules of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) have limited the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on cable channels during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger, and since 2006 the FCC has limited the display of certain commercial website addresses during children’s programming. In early 2017, the FCC initiated a review of its media rules with the objective of eliminating or modifying those that are outdated, unnecessary or unduly burdensome. We are participating in the FCC’s review process. In addition, some policymakers have sought limitations on food and beverage marketing in media popular with children and teens. Restrictions on the television advertising of foods high in fat, salt and sugar to children aged 15 and under have been in place in the UK since 2007 and were enacted in Ireland in 2013. Various laws with similar objectives have also been enacted in France, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Taiwan and South Korea, and significant pressure for similar restrictions continues to be felt globally, most acutely in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, India, Slovenia, South Africa and Turkey. The implementation of these or similar limitations and restrictions could have a negative impact on our Media Networks advertising revenues, particularly for our networks with programming for children and teens.
Children’s Privacy
Other laws and regulations intended to protect the interests of children include measures designed to protect the privacy of minors online. The U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act limits the collection of personal information online from children under 13 years of age by operators of websites or online services. We have been required to limit some functionality on our websites and apps as a result of these regulations. Such regulations also limit the types of advertising we are able to sell on these sites and apps and impose strict liability on us for certain actions of Viacom, advertisers and other third parties, which could affect advertising demand and pricing. State and federal policymakers are also considering regulatory and legislative methods to protect consumer privacy on the Internet, and these efforts have focused particular attention on children and teens.
UK Regulations Affecting Channel 5 Business
As a PSB in the UK, Channel 5 is subject to certain OFCOM broadcasting regulations that impose detailed obligations including mandating the proportion of total programming and programming during peak hours that must be original productions; the hours devoted to news and current affairs; and the proportion of commissioned programming that must be made by independent producers. Channel 5 has also undertaken to air a certain amount of UK-originated children’s programming. Like all UK broadcasters, Channel 5 must abide by the OFCOM Broadcasting Code, which contains content and scheduling regulations relating to harm and offense, protection of individuals under the age of 18, privacy, fairness and product placement, and by OFCOM’s Code on the Scheduling of Television Advertising, which contains regulations on the amount and scheduling of advertising.
Argentine Regulations Affecting Telefe Business
Telefe is governed by Argentina’s Media Law 26522, as amended by Decree 267/1515. A legislative drafting committee is currently drafting a new media and communications law that will govern both the media and telecommunications businesses in Argentina, and the proposed legislation is expected to be released for public consultation in 2018. We will assess the impact of the proposal on our businesses at that time.
EU Commission’s Digital Single Market Strategy
The European Commission (the “EC”) continues to pursue its Digital Single Market (“DSM”) Strategy, which contains a broad range of proposals designed to create a more complete EU-wide market for digital goods and services, several of which are likely to impact Viacom’s businesses. The territorial nature of copyright has been identified by the EC as one of the main barriers to a single European market, and there has been strong pressure from politicians to undermine content owners’ commercial freedom to distribute exclusively on a territorial basis.
The EC published DSM-related legislative proposals in each of May 2016 and September 2016. Several of these proposals are of particular relevance to Viacom’s business practices in Europe given their impact on content owners’ exclusive control over distribution decisions for film and television productions. On June 8, 2017, the Portability Regulation came into force, requiring online content providers to ensure that their subscribers can access content while temporarily in another EU country. Another regulation currently under consideration by the EU Parliament and Council seeks to extend the EU Satellite and Cable Directive 
15

to permit EU-wide licenses for rights included in broadcasters’ online ancillary services, with the aim of making it easier for platforms to respond to passive sales requests for those services from other EU countries without contravening copyright law. A further proposal would entitle talent to seek additional non-contractual compensation through the courts for highly-successful works, which would raise our operating expenses.
The EC will be making a number of reforms to the Audio-Visual Media Services Directive, which sets content and advertising rules for European broadcasters. A liberalization of advertising minutage restrictions on linear channels could cause shifts of advertising spending between broadcasters with an adverse impact on some international channels in certain EU countries. In addition, changes to the operation of the ‘country of origin’ rule, which allows pan-EU broadcasters to be regulated in a single EU jurisdiction, could increase scrutiny of our licensing location decisions, and allow countries to impose levies on services licensed outside of their jurisdiction. The reforms are currently the subject of EU Parliamentary and Council scrutiny, with final agreement expected in the first half of 2018.
Restrictions on Film Distribution
In addition to the regulations regarding territorial licensing in the EU discussed above, numerous countries around the world impose restrictions on the number and nature of films that may be distributed in that country. Such regulations in China have the greatest impact, as only 34 foreign films can be distributed annually on a revenue share basis based on box office performance. Those films are selected by relevant authorities in China.
Personal Data Transfers from the EU to the U.S and EU Data Protection Laws
Viacom’s operations rely upon the ability to access or transfer personal data internationally, including between the EU and the U.S. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield (“Privacy Shield”) is a framework that became effective in July 2016 for the permitted transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S. Viacom self-certified to the Privacy Shield effective October 28, 2016. Nevertheless, some of the mechanisms permitting transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S. have been subject to legal challenges, the outcomes of which remain uncertain. Moreover, the Privacy Shield framework is subject to annual review by the relevant EU and U.S. authorities and the outcome of such future reviews is uncertain. In addition, the new EU General Data Protection Regulation, which becomes enforceable on May 25, 2018, will continue to regulate international data transfers while expanding other data protection compliance obligations and authorizing significantly increased fines for noncompliance, requiring additional compliance resources and efforts on our part.
Program Access
Under the U.S. Communications Act of 1934, as amended, vertically integrated cable programmers are generally prohibited from entering into exclusive distribution arrangements or offering different prices, terms or conditions to competing MVPDs unless the differential is justified by certain permissible factors set forth in the regulations promulgated by the FCC. Our wholly-owned program services are not currently subject to these program access rules. Because we and CBS are under common control, each company’s businesses, as well as the businesses of any other commonly controlled company, may be attributable to the other companies for purposes of the program access rules, and therefore the businesses and conduct of CBS could have the effect of making us subject to the rules. In September 2016, the FCC proposed to expand the scope of its rules implementing the program access provisions of the Communications Act. If Viacom or its programming agreements were to become subject to the program access rules, our flexibility to negotiate the most favorable terms available for our content and our ability to offer cable television operators exclusive programming could be adversely affected.
Protecting our Content from Copyright Theft
The unauthorized reproduction, distribution, exhibition or other exploitation of copyrighted material interferes with the market for copyrighted works and disrupts our ability to distribute and monetize our content. The theft of motion pictures, television and other entertainment content presents a significant challenge to our industry, and we take a number of steps to address this concern. Where possible, we make use of technological protection tools, such as encryption, to protect our content. We are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property, including: monitoring online destinations that distribute or otherwise infringe our content and sending takedown or cease and desist notices in appropriate circumstances; using filtering technologies employed by some user-generated content sites; and pursuing litigation and referrals to law enforcement with respect to websites and other online platforms that distribute or facilitate the distribution and exploitation of our content without authorization. We also are actively engaged in educational outreach to the creative community, labor unions, state and federal government officials and other stake holders in an effort to marshal greater resources to combat copyright theft. Additionally, we participate in various industry-wide enforcement initiatives, public relations programs and legislative activities on a worldwide basis. We have had notable success with site-blocking efforts in Europe and Asia, which can be effective in diverting consumers from piracy platforms to legitimate platforms.
Notwithstanding these efforts and the many legal protections that exist to combat piracy, the proliferation of content theft and technological tools with which to carry it out continue to be a challenge. The failure to maintain enhanced legal protections and 
16

enforcement tools and to update those tools as threats evolve could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could negatively impact its value and further increase the costs of enforcing our rights as we continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We create, own and distribute intellectual property worldwide. It is our practice to protect our motion pictures, programs, content, brands, formats, characters, games, publications and other original and acquired works, and ancillary goods and services. The following brands, logos, trade names, trademarks and related trademark families are a few of those strongly identified with the product lines they represent and are significant assets of the Company: Viacom®, Nickelodeon®, Nick Jr.®, MTV®, BET®, Comedy Central®, Paramount Network™, SPIKE®, Nick at Nite®, Nicktoons®, TeenNick®, MTV2®, MTV Classic®, VH1®, CMT®, TV Land®, Logo®, Channel 5® (UK), Telefe® (Argentina), Colors®, Paramount Channel™, mtvU®, Palladia®, BET Networks®, BET HerTM, BET Gospel®, BET Hip Hop®, BET.com®, BET Mobile®, Tr3s®, Paramount Pictures®, Paramount Vantage®, Paramount Classics®, Paramount Animation®, Paramount Players™, Insurge Pictures®, MTV Films®, Nickelodeon Movies™, Paramount Television™ and other domestic and international program services and digital properties.
EMPLOYEES AND LABOR MATTERS
As of September 30, 2017, we employed approximately 10,750 full-time and part-time employees worldwide, and had approximately 900 additional project-based staff on our payroll. We also use many other temporary employees in the ordinary course of our business.
Our Filmed Entertainment segment, through in-house, affiliated and third-party production service companies, engages the services of writers, directors, performers, musicians and various crew members who are subject to certain industry-wide and/or specially negotiated collective bargaining agreements. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (“AMPTP”) is a multi-employer trade association, which, along with and on behalf of hundreds of member companies including Paramount Pictures, negotiates the industry-wide collective bargaining agreements with these parties. The AMPTP agreements with the crew (U.S. and British Columbia), musicians and Canadian performers and directors expire in fiscal year 2018. Certain collective bargaining agreements that apply to specific companies have been negotiated in the past, and we expect will be negotiated as the need arises in the future.
Our Media Networks segment, through in-house and third-party production service companies, engages for certain of our productions the services of writers, directors, performers, musicians and various crew members who are subject to certain specially negotiated collective bargaining agreements or one-off agreements. Since these agreements are entered into on a per-channel or per-project basis, negotiations occur on various agreements throughout the year.
Any dispute with the labor organizations that represent any of these parties could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues.
