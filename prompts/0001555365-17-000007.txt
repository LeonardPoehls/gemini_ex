Overview
The WhiteWave Foods Company (“WhiteWave”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a leading consumer packaged food and beverage company that manufactures, markets, distributes and sells branded plant-based foods and beverages, coffee creamers and beverages, premium dairy products and organic produce. We sell products primarily in North America, Europe and through a joint venture in China. The Company is focused on providing consumers with innovative, great-tasting food and beverage choices that meet their increasing desires for nutritious, flavorful, convenient, and responsibly-produced products. The Company's widely-recognized, leading brands distributed in North America include Silk®, So Delicious® and Vega™ plant-based foods and beverages, International Delight® and LAND O LAKES® coffee creamers and beverages, Horizon Organic® and Wallaby Organic® premium dairy products and Earthbound Farm® organic salads, fruits and vegetables. Our popular plant-based foods and beverages brands in Europe include Alpro® and Provamel®. 
Our mission is to change the way the world eats for the better by providing consumers with innovative, great-tasting food and beverage choices that meet their increasing desires for nutritious, flavorful, convenient, and responsibly-produced products.
WhiteWave is a Delaware corporation and our common stock, par value $0.01 per share trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “WWAV.”
Agreement to be Acquired by Danone S.A.
On July 6, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which we will be acquired by Danone S.A., a leading global food company headquartered in Paris, France. The Merger Agreement provides that, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, July Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Danone (“Merger Sub”) will be merged with and into WhiteWave (the “Merger”) with WhiteWave continuing as the surviving corporation. At the effective time of the Merger, WhiteWave will become a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Danone and each share of WhiteWave common stock that is issued and outstanding automatically will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $56.25 in cash, without interest.
The closing of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by WhiteWave stockholders; the expiration or termination of all applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (“HSR Act”) and the Competition Act of Canada; and the approval of the Merger by the European Commission pursuant to the EU Merger Regulation. 
On October 4, 2016, our stockholders adopted the Merger Agreement. On September 13, 2016, the Canadian Commissioner of Competition issued an advance ruling certificate, which included a waiver of the parties’ notification requirement in Canada. On December 16, 2016, the parties obtained regulatory clearance of the Merger from the European Commission. 
The United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) continues to review the Merger under the HSR Act. As we previously announced, each of WhiteWave and Danone elected on January 6, 2017 to extend the Long Stop Date under the Merger Agreement by 90 days to facilitate the completion of the DOJ’s review. We are targeting completion of the merger in first quarter 2017, although there can be no assurance regarding timing of completion of regulatory processes.

Our Customers
We sell our products across North America and Europe to a variety of customers, including grocery stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience stores, and health food stores, as well as various away-from-home channels, including restaurants and foodservice outlets. Our top ten customers together accounted for 49.0% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our largest customer is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which, including its subsidiaries such as Sam’s Club, accounted for 13.3% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Sales to customers in North America accounted for 86%, 86%, and 85% of our total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
Sales Organization
We sell our products in North America and Europe primarily through our direct sales force, independent brokers, regional brokers and distributors. Our sales organization strives to cultivate strong, collaborative relationships with customers that facilitate favorable shelf placement for our products, which, we believe, when combined with our marketing capabilities and our brand strength, drives high product sales volumes. Our relationship with a national broker in the United States serves to provide additional retail customer coverage as a supplement to our direct sales force, which has contributed to our growth and has allowed us to provide enhanced service to our customers. Additionally, in Europe, we have an extensive network of partners through which we continue to build and grow relationships with customers beyond our core geographies.
Marketing and Advertising
We use a variety of marketing efforts to build awareness of, and create demand for, our products. We employ regional, national, and, for our Europe segment, international promotions of our brands and products through a variety of media, including television and radio advertising, print media, coupons, co-marketing arrangements, and social media. We build campaigns for our 
3

brands around certain themes to strategically appeal to the consumers whom we believe will be attracted to our products. For example, in our television, radio, and print advertising, we emphasize the healthy attributes of Silk, Horizon Organic, So Delicious, Earthbound Farm, Wallaby and Alpro, and we highlight the ability to create a “coffeehouse experience” at home with International Delight. These marketing efforts are enhanced by our internal creative services team, who collaborate with our brand teams at critical points in the advertising cycle and lead innovation in marketing through various channels. Also, our employees regularly participate in community outreach and charity and sponsorship work. We believe that our community programs and partnerships reinforce our brands’ values and build strong and lasting relationships with consumers.
Research and Development
At our research and development ("R&D") facilities in Louisville, Colorado, San Juan Bautista, California and Wevelgem, Belgium, our experienced consumer packaged goods professionals generate and test new product concepts, new flavors, and packaging. Our 67,000-square-foot Technical Innovation Center in Louisville, Colorado includes a demonstration kitchen, culinary development areas and a packaging-sciences area and expands our capabilities in product development, dairy and plant-based chemistry, and processing technology, enables us to conduct focus group studies and consumer testing of new product concepts and provides opportunities to develop product prototypes and marketing strategies with direct consumer input. Our Wevelgem, Belgium R&D professionals have extensive experience in developing a broad range of plant-based products, including plant-based drinks, yogurts, desserts, culinary creams and margarine.
We believe that innovation is central to the ongoing successful performance of our business. To that end, innovation is one of our core strategies and we hold every business unit accountable for executing against innovation priorities. 
Our R&D organization primarily develops products internally, but also leverages external technical experts for open innovation for new product ideas and concepts. Additionally, our R&D teams are actively involved in cost reduction initiatives across all of our businesses. See Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Research and Development,” for information about our total R&D expenses.
Manufacturing and Distribution
Sourcing and Supply Chain
Americas Foods & Beverages. Raw materials used in our plant-based foods and beverages, premium dairy and coffee creamers and beverages products include organic and conventional milk, butterfat, almonds, organic and non-genetically modified ("non-GMO") soybeans, sweeteners and other commodities. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these raw materials to enable us to take appropriate action to obtain the ingredients and packaging we need for production. Although the prices of our principal raw materials fluctuate based on adverse weather, the economy, and other conditions, we believe such raw materials to be generally available from numerous sources. For example, we source almost all of the raw organic milk for our premium dairy products from our network of nearly 600 family farms throughout the United States.
For our organic salads, fruits and vegetables, we source fresh leafy greens and other produce from owned and leased property that we farm ourselves and from third-party growers. Under seasonal contract arrangements with third-party growers, we either take the risk of ownership prior to the growing season or purchase fresh produce at the time of harvest and we generally are responsible for harvesting, cooling, transporting, and processing the product. Because leafy greens are extremely sensitive to temperature and humidity, harvested produce is promptly cooled and shipped in temperature-controlled trucks to our central processing and distribution facility, where it is inspected, processed, packaged and boxed for shipment. The finished goods then travel primarily to customer distribution centers or third-party distributors for further redistribution. Orders for value-added salads and other fresh-cut produce are picked up by or shipped to customers quickly after processing. 
We have an extensive production and supply chain footprint in the United States. The Americas Foods & Beverages segment utilizes 12 production facilities and several strategic co-packers in the United States. Some of our plants are dedicated to the production of specific products or brands, while other plants can accommodate multiple product lines. Our advanced production capabilities provide us with applications of technology in extended shelf life, or ultra-high temperature, and aseptic processing, gable-top, plastic, aseptic, single-serve and portion control packaging, cultured processing, frozen novelty products and allergen management functions.
Our strategic distribution network allows us to achieve broad channel reach to customers of our Americas Foods & Beverages business. We believe the flexibility provided by our distribution network allows us to quickly and efficiently service our customers’ needs. 
Europe Foods & Beverages. We also have a strategic supply chain footprint across Europe, utilizing three production facilities and a limited number of co-packers. Our facilities located in the United Kingdom, Belgium and France produce a broad range of 
4

plant-based drinks, yogurts, desserts and culinary creams, with the remainder produced by third-party co-packers. Raw materials used in our products include organic and conventional non-GMO soybeans, almond, coconut, hazelnuts, sweeteners and other commodities, all of which are submitted to strict control measures, traceability of our raw materials and external certification. We apply proprietary soybean de-hulling, base milk manufacturing, and yogurt fermentation technologies in our production processes, which we believe results in better taste and high product yields for our products.
Quality Assurance
Across our Company, we have implemented robust production and safety protocols at numerous points throughout our supply chain to ensure the safety and quality of our products. For example, our contracts with our farmers and suppliers contain strict standards for quality, and we periodically audit certification compliance. We also perform a hazard analysis, following HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) protocol, on ingredients and products and develop critical control points to effectively mitigate risk. For example, raw organic milk is tested for impurities and antibiotics and, prior to release for sale, is tested to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and our high standards. For our fresh greens, we perform on-farm food safety assessments and test raw materials and finished products for the presence of bacteria that can cause human illness.
Trademarks and Intellectual Property
We consider our intellectual property to be material assets of our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, patents, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our brands, technology, know-how and other intellectual property rights. We own numerous trademarks and patents in countries around the world. Trademark registrations generally have renewable, fixed terms and, depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Our significant trademarks in North America include Silk, So Delicious, Vega, International Delight, Horizon Organic, Wallaby Organic and Earthbound Farm. In Europe, our significant trademarks include Alpro and Provamel. We also license the right to utilize certain brand names from third parties, including LAND O LAKES, Almond Joy, Cold Stone Creamery, Cinnabon, Dunkin Donuts, Heath, Hershey’s, TruMoo, and YORK, on certain of our products. In addition, we have a license agreement with DSM Nutritional Products, the owner of Martek Biosciences Corporation, to use products covered by patents for supplementing certain of our premium dairy and soy products with DHA Omega-3.
We are continually developing new technology and enhancing proprietary technology related to our products and operations. Our issued patents extend for varying periods depending on the date the patent application was filed or granted and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, as determined by the patent office or administrator in the applicable country, and the availability of legal remedies in the applicable country. 
Despite these protections, it may be possible for unauthorized parties to copy, obtain, or use certain portions of our proprietary technology or trademarks. Such unauthorized use could reduce the value of our products and brands, or have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment and face competition in each of our product categories and subcategories. We have numerous competitors of varying sizes, including manufacturers of private label products, as well as manufacturers of other branded food products, which compete for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars. We compete with large conventional consumer packaged foods companies such as General Mills, Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company, and Nestle S.A. We also compete with natural and organic consumer packaged foods companies such as The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., Blue Diamond, HP Hood, Califia Farms and Organic Valley. Competitors of our organic salads, fruits and vegetables platform include Taylor Farms, Organicgirl, and Olivia's Organics which also produce organic and value-added salads.
Competitive factors in our industry include product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, product variety and ingredients, product packaging and package design, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, and our ability to identify and satisfy consumer tastes and preferences.
Corporate Responsibility
We are committed to operating our business in an ethical, environmentally sustainable, and socially responsible manner. We have a dedicated global sustainability framework, with clear objectives, designed to address environmental protection, economic growth and social equity. Our strategy begins with how we source our ingredients, and continues all the way through how we get our products to market and educate consumers through on-pack recycling guidelines. Our commitment to transparency is showcased through our participation in a variety of forums including Carbon Disclosure Project Climate Change, Water and Forestry, where we scored an “A- Leadership” ranking for the quality of climate change related information disclosed to investors and the global 
5

marketplace. For us, transparency also applies to our clear labeling practices, which are designed to help consumers understand what’s in the food and beverages they eat and drink. Nearly 75% of our brand portfolio carries either Non-GMO Project Verified, ProTerra Certified Non-GMO, or certified organic labels. For more information on our sustainability initiatives, see our 2014-2015 Corporate Social Responsibility Report under “Why We Matter” on our website at www.whitewave.com.
WhiteWave also partners with various non-profit organizations in the communities in which we operate. Through our Values in Action program, we encourage our North America employees to volunteer with organizations in the areas of hunger relief and sustainability, and we donate cash and products to our non-profit partners that focus on ending hunger and reducing environmental impacts. One of the stand-outs is our partnership with Feeding America food banks throughout North America. As part of an annual fundraiser, WhiteWave matches employee donations dollar for dollar and, in 2016, employee donations provided more than 2.8 million meals to families in need. We are also driving positive change in Europe. For example, Europe Foods & Beverages participates in World Wildlife Fund’s Green Ambassadors program, which encourages sustainability initiatives in 4,500 primary schools throughout the U.K. and empowers children aged 5-11 to take action on sustainability in their schools. In 2016, Europe Foods & Beverages contributed approximately £100,000 to this program. In addition, our European business is a key supporter of Malnutrition Matters, a Canadian non-profit organization dedicated to providing sustainable low cost food technology solutions to malnutrition, primarily by using soy ingredients. We believe that our customers, consumers, and suppliers value our efforts to operate in an ethical, environmentally sustainable, and socially responsible manner.
Seasonality
Sales of our products are generally evenly distributed throughout the year, with slightly higher sales in the fourth quarter due to the holidays.
Employees
As of January 2017, we employed approximately 5,800 people worldwide, of which approximately 28% were covered by collective bargaining agreements or works council representation. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
Government Regulation
Food-Related Regulations
As a manufacturer and distributor of food and beverage products, we are subject to a number of federal, state, local and multi-national regulations related to labeling, packaging, pricing, marketing and advertising, privacy and related areas. In addition, various jurisdictions regulate our operations involving such matters as the licensing and inspection of our manufacturing facilities, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention. These policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review.
In the United States, we are subject to a number of food-related regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging, and safety of food in the United States. In addition, the FDA enforces the Public Health Service Act, which authorizes regulatory activity necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases. These regulations require, for example, pasteurization of milk and milk products. The FDA also is implementing the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 ("FSMA") which, among other things, mandates that the FDA adopt preventive controls to be implemented by farms, warehouses, food facilities and transporters in order to minimize or prevent hazards to food safety. 
In Europe, we also are subject to a number of food-related regulations, including General Food Law Regulation 178/2002, which provides a horizontal framework underpinning all European Union and national measures relating to food and covers all stages of the production, processing and distribution of food; the Regulation on Food Information to Consumers 169/2011, which governs labeling in general, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs as well as nutrition labeling for foodstuffs; and the Regulation on Health and Nutrition Claims 1924/2006, which establishes the legal framework for food business operators wishing to highlight particular beneficial properties of their products in relation to health and nutrition. 
We believe that we are in material compliance with the regulations applicable to our business. We continually monitor developments in the laws and regulations applicable to our business and we currently do not expect that the cost of complying with new laws and regulations will be material. 
6

Employee Safety Regulations
We are subject to certain safety regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We believe that we are in material compliance with all employee safety regulations applicable to our business.
Environmental Regulations
We are subject to various environmental laws, regulations, and directives, including the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Our production facilities use a number of chemicals that are considered to be “extremely” hazardous substances pursuant to applicable environmental laws due to their toxicity, including ammonia, which is used extensively in our operations as a refrigerant. These and other chemicals used in our operations must be handled, stored, and disposed in accordance with applicable environmental requirements, including those governing, among other things, air emissions and the discharge of wastewater and other pollutants, the use of refrigerants, the handling and disposal of hazardous materials, and the cleanup of contamination in the environment. Also, on occasion, certain of our facilities discharge biodegradable wastewater into municipal waste treatment facilities and, as a result, certain of our facilities are required to pay wastewater surcharges or to construct wastewater pretreatment facilities. To date, such wastewater surcharges have not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
We expect to incur ongoing costs to comply with existing and future environmental requirements. For example, we maintain aboveground petroleum storage tanks at some of our facilities. We periodically inspect these tanks to determine whether they are in compliance with applicable regulations, and, as a result of such inspections, we are required to make expenditures from time to time to ensure that these tanks remain in compliance. In addition, upon removal of the tanks, we are sometimes required to make expenditures to restore the site in accordance with applicable environmental laws. To date, such expenditures have not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
In the United States, portions of our fresh fruit and vegetable farm properties are irrigated by surface water supplied by local government agencies using facilities financed by federal or state agencies, as well as from underground sources. Water received through federal facilities is subject to acreage limitations under the 1982 Reclamation Reform Act. Worldwide, the quantity and quality of water supplies varies depending on weather conditions and government regulations. We believe that under normal conditions these water supplies are adequate for current production needs.
We believe that we are in material compliance with the environmental regulations applicable to our business. We do not expect the cost of our continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, cash flows, or competitive position in the foreseeable future.
Milk Industry Regulations
The U.S. federal government establishes minimum prices for raw milk purchased in federally regulated areas. Raw milk primarily contains raw skim milk, in addition to a small percentage of butterfat.
The federal government’s minimum prices vary depending on the processor’s geographic location or sales area and the type of product manufactured. Federal minimum prices change monthly. Class I butterfat and raw skim milk prices (which are the minimum prices for raw milk that is processed into Class I products such as fluid milk) and Class II raw milk prices (which are the minimum prices for raw milk that is processed into Class II products such as half & half and cottage cheese products) for each month are announced by the federal government the immediately preceding month.
Some states have established their own rules for determining minimum prices for raw milk. In addition to the federal or state minimum prices, we also may pay producer premiums, procurement costs, and other related charges that vary by location and supplier. While we are subject to federal government regulations that establish minimum prices for milk, the prices we pay producers of organic raw milk are generally well above such minimum prices, as organic milk production is generally more costly, and organic milk therefore commands a price premium.
Labeling Regulations
We are subject to various labeling requirements with respect to our products at the federal, state, and local levels. At the federal level, the FDA has authority to review product labeling, and the Federal Trade Commission may review labeling and advertising materials, including online and television advertisements to determine if advertising materials are misleading. Similarly, many states review dairy product labels to determine whether they comply with applicable state laws. In addition, the European Union has issued and enforces rules governing foodstuff labeling, nutrition, and health claims. We believe we are in material compliance with all labeling laws and regulations applicable to our business.
7

Organic Regulations
Our organic products are required to meet the standards set forth in the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 and the regulations adopted thereunder by the National Organic Program, based on recommendations from the National Organic Standards Board, as well as similar agencies and laws in the European Union and the European countries in which we sell these products. These regulations require strict methods of production for organic food products and limit the ability of food processors to use non-organic or synthetic materials in the production of organic foods or in the raising of organic livestock. We believe that we are in material compliance with the organic regulations applicable to our business.
Ethics and Governance
We maintain a Code of Ethics that applies to all of our directors, executive officers, and employees. Our Code of Ethics is posted on our website at www.whitewave.com on the “Investor Relations” page under the link “Corporate Governance.” Any amendments to or waivers of our Code of Ethics relating to our directors or executive officers that is required to be disclosed also will be posted on our website.
