ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Mid-Con Energy Partners, LP is a publicly held Delaware limited partnership formed in July 2011 that engages in the ownership, acquisition, exploitation and development of producing oil and natural gas properties in North America, with a focus on EOR. Our general partner is Mid-Con Energy GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. Our limited partner units ("common units") are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "MCEP." 
Overview
We operate as one business segment engaged in the ownership, acquisition, exploitation and development of producing oil and natural gas properties. Our properties are located primarily in the Mid-Continent and Permian Basin regions of the United States in three core areas: Southern Oklahoma, Northeastern Oklahoma, and Texas within the Eastern Shelf of the Permian ("Permian"). During 2016, we sold all properties within our Hugoton core area. Our properties primarily consist of mature, legacy onshore oil reservoirs with long-lived, relatively predictable production profiles and low production decline rates.
Our management team has significant industry experience, especially with waterflood projects and, as a result, our operations focus primarily on enhancing the development of producing oil properties through waterflooding. Waterflooding, a form of secondary oil recovery, works by displacing or "sweeping" oil to producing wellbores. Through the continued development of our existing properties and through future acquisitions, we seek to increase our reserves and production in order to make and, over time, increase distributions to our unitholders. Also, in order to enhance the stability of our cash flow for the benefit of our unitholders, we generally intend to hedge a portion of our production volumes through various commodity derivative contracts.
As of December 31, 2016, our total estimated proved reserves were approximately 19.2 MMBoe, of which approximately 95% were oil and 65% were proved developed, both on a Boe basis. As of December 31, 2016, we operated 100% of our properties through our affiliate, Mid-Con Energy Operating, and approximately 60% of our net proved reserves were being produced under waterflood, in each instance on a Boe basis. Our average net production for the month ended December 31, 2016, was approximately 3,760 Boe/d and our total estimated proved reserves had an average reserve-to-production ratio of approximately 14 years.
The following table summarizes information by core area regarding our estimated net proved reserves, count of gross wells, reserve-to-production ratio and our average net production for the month ended December 31, 2016:

(1) Operated through our affiliate, Mid-Con Energy Operating. 
(2) The reserve-to-production ratio is calculated by dividing estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2016, by average net production for the month ended December 31, 2016.
(3) As of December 31, 2016, no wells were waiting on completion and no shut-in wells were associated with proved developed reserves. Only 12 shut-in wells were associated with PUDs and were currently scheduled for return to production as part of planned secondary recovery projects. No wells classified as shut-in were due to operational factors, such as awaiting pipeline or facilities connections.

2016 Highlights
Cost Reductions and Operational Efficiencies
Lease operating expenses ("LOE") of $15.35 per Boe in for the year ended December 31, 2016, decreased approximately 22% from the year ended December 31, 2015. General and administrative expenses ("G&A") of $4.66 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2016, decreased approximately 15% from the year ended December 31, 2015.
Hugoton Core Area Divestiture
 In July 2016, we closed our sale of oil and natural gas assets within the Hugoton core area for cash proceeds of approximately $17.6 million, including post-close adjustments. Net divestiture proceeds were used to reduce borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. 
Permian Bolt-On Acquisition
In August 2016, we closed on our acquisition of oil and natural gas assets in Nolan County, Texas ("Permian Bolt-On") for approximately $18.7 million, after post-closing purchase price adjustments. The acquisition was paid for in cash from proceeds from the Preferred Unit offering.
Preferred Units
 In conjunction with the Permian Bolt-On acquisition, in August 2016, we completed a private offering of $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of Preferred Units. Proceeds were used to fund the Permian Bolt-On acquisition and for general partnership purposes, including the reduction of borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
Debt Reduction
We paid $58.0 million of outstanding debt during 2016, ending the year with a conforming borrowing base of $140.0 million. Our outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2016, were $122.0 million. Funds for debt repayment were provided by the Hugoton core area divestiture, remaining proceeds from the Preferred Unit offering in excess of the Permian Bolt-On acquisition, cash settlements received from the early termination of commodity derivatives (net of premiums) and cash flows from operations.
Our Business Strategies
Our primary business objective is to generate stable cash flows, which we expect will allow us to make quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders and, over time, to increase our quarterly cash distributions. In addition to our hedging strategy described below, we intend to execute the following business strategies:

• | Continue exploitation of our existing properties to maximize production. We plan to continue exploiting our proved reserves to maximize production, primarily through waterflood projects and through various oil recovery methods, including workovers, conventional hydraulic fracturing, re-stimulations, recompletions, infill drilling and other optimization activities. We expect to continue these activities in order to maximize economic production volumes.


• | Pursue acquisitions of long-lived, low-risk producing properties with upside potential. We seek to acquire properties with long-lived reserves, low production decline rates and low-risk development potential. We also will seek to acquire properties within mature oil fields with opportunities for incremental improvements in oil recovery through waterfloods and other recovery techniques, which we believe will offer us additional potential to increase reserves, economic production volumes and cash flows.


• | Capitalize on our relationship with our Mid-Con Affiliate for favorable acquisition opportunities. We expect that our Mid-Con Affiliate will continue to invest capital and technical staff resources to acquire and develop properties with existing waterfloods and to identify, acquire, form and develop new waterflood projects on those properties. Through this relationship with our Mid-Con Affiliate, we plan to avoid much of the capital, engineering and geological risks associated with the early development of any of these properties we may acquire. While they are not obligated to sell any properties to us and may have difficulties acquiring and developing properties, we expect that our Mid-Con Affiliate will offer to sell properties to us from time to time. We believe that the opportunity to acquire properties from our Mid-Con Affiliate provides us with a strategic advantage over those of our competitors who must bear a greater share of development risks themselves.

• | Maintain operational control and a focus on cost effectiveness in all our operations. As of December 31, 2016, Mid-Con Energy Operating operated 100% of our properties, calculated on a Boe basis. We plan to continue exercising this level of operational control over our existing properties and favor acquisitions of operated properties in order to manage the timing and levels of our capital expenditures, development activities and operating costs.


• | Reduce the impact of commodity price volatility on our cash flows through a disciplined commodity hedging strategy. We seek to reduce the impact of commodity price volatility on our cash flows by maintaining a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts to help offset the underlying volatility of oil and natural gas prices. As opposed to entering into commodity derivative contracts at predetermined times or on prescribed terms, we enter into commodity derivative contracts in connection with material increases in our estimated production, at times when we believe market conditions or other circumstances suggest that it is prudent to do so, or as required by our lenders. Additionally, we may take advantage of opportunities to modify our commodity derivative portfolio to change the prices, percentages of our hedged production volumes or the duration of our commodity derivative contracts when circumstances suggest that it is prudent to do so.


• | Employ equity as our primary currency for acquisitions. We intend to maintain an equity-weighted bias towards acquisition financing. Although the cost of equity financing is generally more costly than debt financing, we believe the resulting conservatism and financial flexibility merit the incremental expense of continuing to rely on equity as our primary currency to fund acquisitions.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following competitive strengths will allow us to successfully execute our business strategies and achieve our objective of generating and growing cash available for distribution:

• | An asset portfolio largely consisting of properties with existing waterflood projects with proved reserves, of which approximately 95% are oil, and relatively predictable production profiles that provide growth potential through ongoing response to waterflooding and that have modest capital requirements. Our properties consist of interests in mature fields located in Oklahoma and Texas that have well-understood geologic features, relatively predictable production profiles and modest capital requirements, which we believe make them well-suited for waterflood development and for our objective of generating stable cash flows. Currently, approximately 60% of our net proved reserves on a Boe basis are being produced under waterflood. Based on production estimates from our December 31, 2016, audited reserves, the average estimated decline rate for our existing proved developed producing reserves is approximately 16.5% for 2017 and, on a compounded average decline basis, approximately 10.8% for the subsequent five years and approximately 9.8% thereafter. Further, we believe that a substantial majority of the capital required for growth from our existing properties has already been spent. As a result, these properties have relatively predictable production profiles and production growth potential with modest capital requirements.


• | The ability to further exploit existing mature properties by utilizing our waterflood expertise. We have actively operated a significant portion our properties since 2005 and have a history of exploiting proved reserves to maximize production, primarily through waterflood projects. Over the last ten years, we, along with our affiliates, have identified, initiated, acquired, formed and developed approximately 22% of all new waterflood projects in the state of Oklahoma, while the next most active competitor formed only 7% of all new waterfloods. Furthermore, our experience in the Mid-Continent allows us to exploit synergies developed by applying knowledge of field, reservoir and play characteristics throughout North America. We believe that our expertise in secondary recovery techniques will increase the level of production from certain properties in our portfolio, particularly from existing waterflood projects, which, over time, may increase our cash flows.


• | Acquisition opportunities that are consistent with our criteria of predictable production profiles with upside potential that may arise as a result of our relationship with the Mid-Con Affiliate. We expect that our Mid-Con Affiliate will continue to invest capital and technical staff resources to acquire and develop properties with existing waterfloods and to identify, acquire, form and develop new waterflood projects on those properties. Through this relationship with our Mid-Con Affiliate, we plan to avoid much of the capital, engineering and geological risks associated with the early development of any of these properties we may acquire. While they are not obligated to sell any properties to us and may have difficulties acquiring and developing properties, we expect that our Mid-Con Affiliate will offer to sell properties to us from time to time. We believe that the opportunity to acquire properties from our Mid-Con Affiliate provides us with a strategic advantage over those of our competitors who must bear a greater share of development risks themselves.

• | Access to the collective expertise of Yorktown's employees and their extensive network of industry relationships through our relationship with Yorktown. Yorktown is a private investment firm focused on investments in the energy sector with more than $5.0 billion in assets under management. With their decades of investment experience in the oil and natural gas industry and their extensive network of industry relationships, Yorktown's employees are well positioned to assist us in identifying and evaluating acquisition opportunities and in making strategic decisions.


• | Mid-Con Energy Operating operates 100% of our properties, which allows them to control our operating costs and capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2016, Mid-Con Energy Operating operated 100% of our properties, as calculated on a Boe basis, which allowed it to control our operating costs and capital expenditures. We expect to continue exercising this level of operational control over our properties, including any properties we acquire through future acquisitions, which allows us to better manage our operating costs and capital expenditures. This substantial operational control of our producing properties also allows us to maximize the value of our properties, helps us stabilize our cash flows and affords us better control over the timing and costs of our operations.


• | The range and depth of our technical and operational expertise allows us to expand both geographically and operationally to achieve our goals. We have assembled a senior team of geologists, engineers, landmen, accountants and operational personnel that have been successful in developing a significant number of new waterflood projects. Collectively, our management and employees have prior waterflood experience in over 200 waterflood projects located in 12 states. Through our affiliate, Mid-Con Energy Operating, we have a team of over 70 employees, with senior leadership in all production disciplines, and we have recruited a select group of younger professionals that are being trained in our waterflood specialty. With this expertise and depth, we believe this team has the ability to generate new waterflood projects that may become future acquisition opportunities for us. Beyond our core strength of waterflood development, our range and depth of expertise will allow us to expand both geographically and operationally. Although our projects to date have been focused on waterfloods in the Mid-Continent and Permian regions, our management and operational employees have significant oil and natural gas experience in many other regions of the United States. Our wealth of experience enables us to pursue other types of exploitation opportunities, such as infill drilling projects that could significantly contribute to our strategy of generating stable cash flow and increasing our quarterly cash distributions over time.

Hedging Strategy
Our hedging program's objective is to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations and fluctuations in location differences between published index prices and NYMEX-WTI futures prices. As of December 31, 2016, we had commodity derivative contracts covering approximately 75%, 43% and 12% of our estimated oil production (estimate calculated based on the mid-point of our 2017 Boe production guidance as released on February 28, 2017 and multiplied by a 93% oil weighting based on fourth quarter 2016 reported production volumes) for calendar years 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2016, our derivative contracts had maturities through 2019 and were comprised of commodity price swap, call, put and collar contracts. 
In addition to our primary hedging strategy as described above, we also intend to enter into additional commodity derivative contracts in connection with material increases in our estimated production and at times when we believe market conditions or other circumstances suggest that it is prudent to do so, or as required by our lenders. It is not our strategy to enter into commodity derivative contracts at predetermined times or on prescribed terms. Additionally, we may take advantage of opportunities to modify our commodity derivative portfolio to change the prices, percentages of our hedged production volumes or the duration of our commodity derivative contracts when circumstances suggest that it is prudent to do so.
By removing a portion of price volatility associated with our estimated future oil production, we have mitigated, but not eliminated, the potential effects of changing oil prices on our cash flows from operations for those periods. For a further description of our commodity derivative contracts, please see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.
Our Principal Business Relationships
Our Relationship with our Mid-Con Affiliate
Our Mid-Con Affiliate acquires and develops oil and natural gas properties that are either undeveloped or that may require significant capital investment and development efforts before they meet our criteria for ownership. As these development projects mature, we expect to have the opportunity to acquire some of these properties from our Mid-Con Affiliate. Through this relationship with our Mid-Con Affiliate, we plan to avoid much of the capital, engineering and 
10

geological risks associated with the early development of any of these properties we may acquire. However, our Mid-Con Affiliate may not be successful in identifying or consummating acquisitions or in successfully developing the new properties they acquire. Further, our Mid-Con Affiliate is not obligated to sell any properties to us, and they are not prohibited from competing with us to acquire oil and natural gas properties. 
Services Agreement
We are party to a services agreement with Mid-Con Energy Operating, pursuant to which, Mid-Con Energy Operating provides certain services to us, our subsidiaries and our general partner, including management, administrative and operational services. The operational services include marketing, geological and engineering services. Under the services agreement, we reimburse Mid-Con Energy Operating, on a monthly basis, for the allocable expenses it incurs in its performance under the services agreement. These expenses include, among other things, salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts paid to persons who perform services for us or on our behalf and other expenses allocated by Mid-Con Energy Operating to us. Mid-Con Energy Operating has substantial discretion to determine in good faith which expenses to incur on our behalf and what portion to allocate back to us. Mid-Con Energy Operating will not be liable to us for its performance of, or failure to perform, services under the services agreement unless its acts or omissions constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Operating Agreements 
We, various third parties with an ownership interest in the same property and our affiliate, Mid-Con Energy Operating, are parties to standard oil and natural gas joint operating agreements, pursuant to which we and those third parties pay Mid-Con Energy Operating overhead associated with operating our properties. We and those third parties also pay Mid-Con Energy Operating for its direct and indirect expenses that are chargeable to the wells under their respective operating agreements. 
Oilfield Services 
We are party to operating agreements, pursuant to which our affiliate, Mid-Con Energy Operating, bills us for oilfield services performed by our affiliate, ME3 Oilfield Service. These amounts are included in either lease operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations or are capitalized as part of oil and natural gas properties in our consolidated balance sheets.
Our Relationship with Yorktown
We have a valuable relationship with Yorktown, a private investment firm founded in 1991 and focused on investments in the energy sector. Since 2004, Yorktown has made several equity investments in our predecessor. Peter A. Leidel, a principal of Yorktown, serves on our Board of Directors.
Yorktown currently has more than $5.0 billion in assets under management and Yorktown's employees have extensive investment experience in the oil and natural gas industry. Yorktown's employees review a large number of potential acquisitions and are involved in decisions relating to the acquisition and disposition of oil and natural gas assets by the various portfolio companies in which Yorktown owns interests. With their extensive investment experience in the oil and natural gas industry and their extensive network of industry relationships, Yorktown's employees are well positioned to assist us in identifying and evaluating acquisition opportunities and in making strategic decisions. Yorktown is not obligated to sell any properties to us, and they are not prohibited from competing with us to acquire oil and natural gas properties. Investment funds managed by Yorktown manage numerous other portfolio companies, including our Mid-Con Affiliate, which is engaged in the oil and natural gas industry and, as a result, Yorktown may present acquisition opportunities to other Yorktown portfolio companies that compete with us.
Our Areas of Operation
As of December 31, 2016, our properties were primarily located in the Mid-Continent and Permian regions of the United States in three core areas: Southern Oklahoma, Northeastern Oklahoma and Texas within the Eastern Shelf of the Permian. These core areas are generally composed of multiple waterflood units that are in close proximity to one another, produce from geologically similar reservoirs and utilize similar recovery methods. Focusing on these core areas allows us to apply our cumulative technical and operational knowledge to ongoing property development and to better predict future rates of recovery. For a discussion of the properties in our core areas, please see "Summary of Oil Properties and Projects."
Our properties consist of mature, legacy onshore oil reservoirs of which approximately 60% of the net proved reserves are being produced under waterflooding, on a Boe basis. Our properties include multiple waterflood projects with varying degrees of maturity.

We own an average working interest of approximately 91% in 505 gross (455 net) producing wells, 158 gross (134 net) injection wells, 42 gross (40 net) water supply or disposal wells, and 462 gross (437 net) wells shut-in. We operate 100% of our properties by value, as calculated using our estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2016. Approximately 98% of our revenue was derived from the proceeds of oil production. 
Our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2016, were approximately 19.2 MMBoe, of which approximately 95% were oil and approximately 65% were proved developed, both on a Boe basis. For the month ended December 31, 2016, our average net production was approximately 3,760 Boe/d.
The following table shows our estimated net proved reserves for our core areas, based on a reserve report prepared by our internal reserve engineers and audited by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. ("CG&A"), our independent petroleum engineers, as of December 31, 2016, and certain unaudited information regarding production and sales of oil and natural gas with respect to such properties:

(1) Our estimated net proved reserves and Standardized Measure were computed by applying average 12-month index prices (calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the applicable 12-month period, held constant throughout the life of the properties). These prices were adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees, location differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead. The average 12-month index prices were $42.75 per Bbl for oil and $2.49 per MMBtu for natural gas for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016.
All proved undeveloped locations conform to SEC rules for recording proved undeveloped reserves. None of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2016, have remained undeveloped for more than five years from the date the reserves were initially booked as proved undeveloped.
Summary of Oil Properties and Projects
Following is a summary of our estimated net proved reserves and our Standardized Measure as of December 31, 2016, and the average daily net production of our core areas for the month ended December 31, 2016. 
Southern Oklahoma
Our Southern Oklahoma properties are located in Love and Carter Counties, Oklahoma. The Southern Oklahoma properties consist of six waterflood units operated by Mid-Con Energy Operating, which were unitized by Mid-Con Energy Operating or in conjunction with partners. During December 2016, our properties in these fields produced an average of 1,255 gross (652 net) Boe/d, and contained 2,720 MBoe of estimated net proved reserves. At December 31, 2016, we had an average working interest of approximately 66% in 89 producing, 55 injection and 5 water supply wells (gross). During 2016, we converted 1 gross injection well to a producing well and converted 1 producing well to an injection well.
Northeastern Oklahoma
Our Northeastern Oklahoma properties are located in four counties in Oklahoma: Seminole, Creek, Osage and Pawnee Counties. The majority of our Northeastern Oklahoma properties are being produced under waterflood and are operated by Mid-Con Energy Operating. During December 2016, our properties in these fields produced an average of 1,530 gross (1,274 net) Boe/d and contained 8,366 MBoe of estimated net proved reserves. At December 31, 2016, our average working interest in these properties was approximately 97% in 240 producing, 61 injection, 14 disposal and 3 water supply wells (gross). During 2016, we drilled 4 gross producing wells and changed the targeted injection formation in 3 gross wells.
12

Permian
Our Permian properties are located in ten counties in Texas: Coke, Coleman, Fisher, Haskell, Jones, Kent, Nolan, Runnels, Stonewall and Taylor Counties. We acquired our first properties in November 2014 and in August 2016 we acquired additional oil and natural gas properties located in Nolan County, Texas. The Permian properties have four waterflood units operated by Mid-Con Energy Operating. During December 2016, our properties in these fields produced an average of 2,414 gross (1,789 net) Boe/d and contained 7,766 MBoe of estimated net proved reserves. At December 31, 2016, we had an average working interest of approximately 95% in 172 producing, 38 injection, 16 disposal and 3 water supply wells (gross). During 2016, we drilled 6 gross producing wells and converted 6 gross producing wells to injection wells.
Other Properties
The balance of the Partnership's properties, located in the Gulf Coast area of Texas, consists of operated properties which are under waterflood. During December 2016, our other properties produced an average of 67 gross (45 net) Boe/d and contained 379 MBoe of estimated net proved reserves. At December 31, 2016, we had an average working interest of approximately 100% in 4 producing, 4 injection and 1 water supply wells (gross). During 2016, we converted 1 gross producing well to an injection well.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Production
Internal Controls Relating to Reserve Estimates
We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data used in our reserves estimation process. Our internal controls over the recording of reserves estimates require reserve estimates to be in compliance with the SEC rules, regulations, definitions and guidance. Our proved reserves are estimated at the well or unit level and compiled for reporting purposes by our reservoir engineering staff. Internal evaluations of our reserves are maintained in a secure reserve engineering database. Reserves are reviewed internally by our senior management on a quarterly basis. Our reserve estimates are audited by our independent third-party reserve engineers, CG&A, at least annually. 
Our staff works closely with CG&A to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data that is furnished to them for their reserve audit process. To facilitate their audit of our reserves, we provide CG&A with any information they may request, including all of our reserve information as well as geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, well performance data, operating procedures, lease operating expenses, product pricing, production taxes and relevant economic criteria. We also make all of our pertinent personnel available to CG&A to respond to any questions they may have.
Technology Used to Establish Proved Reserves
Under the SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The term "reasonable certainty" implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, our internal reserve engineers and CG&A employ technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, injection data, seismic data and well test data. Reserves attributable to producing properties with sufficient production history are estimated using appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. Reserves attributable to producing properties with limited production history and for undeveloped locations are estimated using performance from analogous properties in the surrounding area and geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. These properties were considered to be analogous based on production performance from the same formation and similar completion techniques.

The unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month prices for the prior twelve months were $42.75 per Bbl for oil and $2.49 per MMBtu for natural gas at December 31, 2016. These prices were adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees, location differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead. Average adjusted prices used were $40.03 per Bbl of oil and $1.99 per Mcf of natural gas.
The data in the table above represent estimates only. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured exactly. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Accordingly, reserve estimates may vary from the quantities of oil that are ultimately recovered. For a discussion of risks associated with internal reserve estimates, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business." Our estimated proved reserves and future production rates rely on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our estimated reserves.
Future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. The Standardized Measure amounts should not be construed as the current market value of our estimated oil reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate Standardized Measure, which is required by Financial Accounting Standard Board pronouncements, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate.

Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves
With respect to PUDs, we have established a development plan approved by the Vice President of Exploitation of Mid-Con Energy Operating that will result in converting the PUDs within five years from the initial disclosure of the reserves and the associated development capital requirements are equal to or less than the management-approved capital program on a year-by-year basis. If either of these criteria cease to be met, we remove the associated PUDs from our proved reserves disclosures.
Our development plan includes PUDs that are based upon qualitative and quantitative factors including estimated risk-based returns, current pricing forecasts, recent drilling results and waterflood responses. None of our PUDs at December 31, 2016, are scheduled to be developed on a date more than five years from the date the reserves were initially booked as proved undeveloped. Consistent with the typical waterflood response time range of 6-18 months from initial development, the transfer of PUDs to the proved developed category is attributable to development costs incurred. During 2016, our capital expenditures for development (drilling, recompletion and conversion to injection) were approximately $5.5 million. Based on our current expectations of cash flows and the successful development activity in our Permian and Northeastern Oklahoma core areas, we plan to increase our 2017 capital spending budget for the development of our PUDs and look for development opportunities that can be funded from our cash flows from operations. For a more detailed discussion of our pro forma liquidity position, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources."
For the year ended December 31, 2016, our PUDs decreased from 7,090 MBoe to 6,808 MBoe. The decrease was primarily attributable to:
Conversion to proved developed reserves. We converted 1,351 MBoe from PUDs to proved developed reserves.
Revision of previous estimates. Commodity prices continued to decrease in 2016. The 12-month average price for crude oil decreased 15% from $50.28 per Bbl for 2015 compared to $42.75 per Bbl for 2016, while the 12-month average price for natural gas decreased 4% from $2.58 per MMBtu in 2015 compared to $2.49 per MMBtu for 2016. These decreases had an adverse impact on our PUDs estimates, resulting in downward reserve revisions of 185 MBoe during the year ending December 31, 2016. In response to the continued decrease in commodity prices throughout 2016, we further refined our development plans to concentrate on our core areas in Northeastern Oklahoma and the Permian. We saw positive oil production responses to water injection in our Northeastern Oklahoma and Permian areas resulting in the upward revision of 1,361 MBoe in PUDs from anticipated production performance of existing waterflood projects as well as development plans for additional waterflood projects in the Permian core area. 
Purchases of reserves in place. These are additions to PUDs resulting from the acquisition of properties during the year ended December 31, 2016. The Permian Bolt-On acquisition, which closed on August 11, 2016, resulted in a positive change of 598 MBoe.
Sales of reserves in place. These are reductions to PUDs resulting from the disposition of properties during the year ended December 31, 2016. On July 28, 2016, the Hugoton core area properties were sold resulting in a downward revision of 705 MBoe.
The following table provides further details with respect to various factors that impacted the changes in our PUDs during 2016:

 | Net Oil | | Net Gas | | Total 
 | MBbls | | MMcf | | Net MBoe

Development Activities
During 2016, we undertook a paced development program consisting of drilling approximately 10 gross (10 net) development wells, all of which reside in our Permian and Northeastern Oklahoma core areas. As part of our waterflood development program, approximately 11 gross (10 net) producing wells were converted to injectors or the targeted injection formation was changed with the majority of the conversions taking place in our Corsica Unit in the Permian core area. We will continue our development program and look for additional opportunities that can be funded from our cash flows from operations in 2017.
In our Permian core area, we drilled 6 gross (6 net) development wells in the Corsica Strawn, White Flats and Hard Rock fields. We continue to evaluate these properties for additional drilling opportunities and waterflood potential.
In our Northeastern Oklahoma core area, we drilled 4 gross (4 net) development wells in our Northeastern Oklahoma core area during 2016.
The following table sets forth information with respect to development activities during the periods indicated. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance nor should a correlation be assumed between the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value.

Productive Wells
The following table sets forth information relating to the productive wells in which we owned a working interest as of December 31, 2016. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities. Gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we own a working interest, and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells.

(1) As of December 31, 2016, no wells were waiting on completion and no shut-in wells were associated with proved developed reserves. Only 12 shut-in wells were associated with PUDs and were currently scheduled for return to production as part of planned secondary recovery projects. No wells classified as shut-in were due to operational factors, such as awaiting pipeline or facilities connections.
Production by Field
The following table sets forth our production for 2016, 2015 and 2014 from each of our fields that we represent as our core areas: 

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014 
 | Oil | Natural Gas | | Oil | Natural Gas | Oil | | Natural Gas
Core Area | (MBbls) | (MMcf) | | (MBbls) | (MMcf) | (MBbls) | | (MMcf) 
Southern Oklahoma | 274 | | 8 | | 354 | | 10 | | 428 | 8 
Northeastern Oklahoma | 458 | | 126 | | 482 | | 165 | | 344 | 73 
Cleveland Field (1) | 255 | | 8 | | 244 | | 9 | | 178 | 12

Total | 1,386 | | 554 | | 1,623 | | 570 | | 1,106 | 139

(1) Northeastern Oklahoma includes the production from the Cleveland Field, which is the only field that represented 15% or more of our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
(2) Hugoton core area properties were divested in July 2016.
Developed Acreage
The following table sets forth information relating to our leasehold acreage. Acreage related to royalty, overriding royalty and other similar interests is excluded from this table. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 94% of our leasehold acreage was held by production:

 | Developed Acreage | Undeveloped Acreage
Core Area | Gross | Net | | Gross | Net 
Southern Oklahoma | 8,744 | | 6,454 | | — | — 
Northeastern Oklahoma | 7,248 | | 6,699 | | — | — 
Permian | 16,918 | | 16,168 | | 2,381 | 2,083
Other | 1,262 | | 1,108 | | — | — 
Total | 34,172 | | 30,429 | | 2,381 | 2,083

17

The Southern Oklahoma and Northeastern Oklahoma core areas and other properties do not have any undeveloped acreage because all of our PUDs are related to new drilling or recompletion activities within currently producing areas of our developed acreage and represent in-fill or reduced spacing activity.
Delivery Commitments
We have no commitments to deliver a fixed and determinable quantity of our oil or natural gas production in the near future under our existing contracts.
Operations
General
We operate 100% of our properties, as calculated on a Boe basis as of December 31, 2016, through our affiliate, Mid-Con Energy Operating. We design and manage the development, recompletion or workover procedures for all of the wells we operate and supervise operation and maintenance activities. We do not own the drilling rigs or other oil field services equipment used for drilling or maintaining wells on the properties we operate.
We engage numerous independent contractors to provide all of the equipment and personnel associated with our drilling and maintenance activities, including well servicing, trucking, water hauling, bulldozing, and various downhole services (e.g., logging, cementing, perforating and acidizing). These services are short-term in duration (often being completed in less than a day) and are typically governed by a one-page service order that states only the parties' names, a brief description of the services and the price.
We also engage several independent contractors to provide hydraulic fracturing services. These services are usually completed in four to six hours utilizing lower pressures and volumes of fluid than are typically employed in multi-stage hydraulic fracturing jobs performed in connection with unconventional oil and natural gas shale plays. These services are not normally governed by long-term services contracts, but instead are generally performed under one-time service orders, which state the parties' name and the price. These service orders sometimes contain additional terms, for example, taxes, payment due dates, warranties and limitations of the contractor's liability to damages arising from the contractor's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Geological and Engineering Services
Mid-Con Energy Operating employs production and reservoir engineers, geologists and land specialists, as well as field production supervisors. Through the services agreement, we have the direct operational support of a staff of over 30 petroleum professionals with significant technical expertise. We believe that this technical expertise, which includes extensive experience utilizing secondary recovery methods, particularly waterfloods, differentiates us from, and provides us with a competitive advantage over, many of our competitors. Please see Item 13. "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence — Agreements and Transactions with Affiliates" for more information.
Administrative Services
Mid-Con Energy Operating provides us with management, administrative and operational services under the services agreement. We reimburse Mid-Con Energy Operating, on a cost basis, for the allocable expenses it incurs in performing these services. Mid-Con Energy Operating has substantial discretion to determine in good faith which expenses to incur on our behalf and what portion to allocate to us. For a detailed description of the administrative services provided by Mid-Con Energy Operating pursuant to the services agreement, please see Item 13. "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence — Agreements and Transactions with Affiliates."
Oil and Natural Gas Leases
The typical oil lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all hydrocarbons produced from any well drilled on the lease premises. The lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties range from less than 12.5% to 33.5%, resulting in a net revenue interest to us ranging from 66.5% to 87.5% on a 100% working interest basis. Our average net revenue interest is 76.5%. Most of our leases are held by production and do not require lease rental payments.
Principal Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales of oil and natural gas to four purchasers accounted for approximately 94% of our sales. The loss of any of our customers could temporarily delay production and sale of our oil and natural gas. If we were 
18

to lose any of our significant customers, we believe we could identify substitute customers to purchase the impacted production volumes. However, if any of our customers dramatically decreased or ceased purchasing oil from us, we may experience difficulty receiving comparable rates for our production volumes.
Hedging Activities
We continue to enter into commodity derivative contracts with unaffiliated third parties that are also members of our banking group to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to short-term fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. At December 31, 2016, our commodity derivative contracts had maturities through 2019 and were comprised of price swaps, calls, puts and collars. For a more detailed discussion of our hedging activities, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk — Commodity Price Risk."
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties and securing trained personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. These companies may have a greater ability to continue acquisition, and or exploration and production activities during periods of low commodity prices. Some of our competitors may also possess greater technical and personnel resources than us. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for properties, as well as evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry.
At times, we may also be affected by competition for drilling rigs, completion rigs and the availability of related equipment and services. In times past, the United States onshore oil and natural gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling and completion rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which have delayed development drilling and other exploitation activities and caused significant increases in the price for this equipment and personnel. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may occur or how they would affect our development and exploitation programs.
Title to Properties
Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil properties, we perform title reviews on significant leases, and depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. As a result, title examinations have been obtained on a significant portion of our properties. After an acquisition, we review the assignments from the seller for scrivener's and other errors and execute and record corrective assignments as necessary.
We initially conduct only a review of the titles to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property.
We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material properties. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests and contract terms and restrictions, liens under operating agreements, liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations, liens for current taxes and other burdens, easements, restrictions and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens and encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties or materially interfere with our use of these properties in the operation of our business. In addition, we believe that we have obtained sufficient rights-of-way grants and permits from public authorities and private parties for us to operate our business.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing has been a routine part of the completion process for the majority of the wells on our producing properties in Oklahoma and Texas for several decades. Most of our properties are dependent on our ability to hydraulically fracture the producing formations. We are currently conducting hydraulic fracturing activities in our Northeastern Oklahoma and Southern Oklahoma core areas. The majority of our leasehold acreage is currently held by production from existing wells. Therefore, fracturing is not currently required to maintain this acreage but it will be required in the future to develop the majority of our proved behind pipe and proved undeveloped reserves associated with this acreage. Nearly all of our proved behind pipe and proved undeveloped reserves associated with future drilling and recompletion projects, or 35% of our total 
19

estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2016, will be subject to hydraulic fracturing. Although the cost of each well will vary, on average approximately 7% of the total cost of drilling and completing a well is associated with hydraulic fracturing activities. These costs are treated in the same way that all other costs of drilling and completing our wells are treated and are built into and funded through our normal capital expenditure budget.
For information regarding existing and proposed governmental regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters, please see "Environmental Matters and Regulation —Water Discharges" in this section. For related risks to our unitholders, please see "Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business." Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.
Insurance
In accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance against many potential operating risks to which our business could be exposed. Our coverage includes general liability, commercial umbrella liability, control of well, auto liability, property and equipment, worker's compensation and employer's liability, and directors and officers liability.
Currently, we have coverage for general liability insurance coverage, which includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability and legal and contractual liabilities arising out of property damage and bodily injury, among other things. The insurance policies contain maximum policy limits and in most cases, deductibles that must be met prior to recovery and are subject to certain customary exclusions and limitations. This insurance coverage is in addition to the general and automobile liability policies and may be triggered if the general or automobile liability insurance policy limits are exceeded and exhausted. The control of well policy insures us for blowout risks associated with drilling, completing and operating our wells, including above ground pollution. 
These policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities, and no assurance can be given that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise, or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Environmental Matters and Regulation
General
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, tribal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations; (ii) govern the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with oil drilling and production activities; (iii) restrict the way we handle or dispose of our wastes; (iv) limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; (v) require investigatory and remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; and (vi) impose obligations to reclaim and abandon wellsites. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations.
These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, the U.S. Congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, drilling, disposal, and remediation requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
The clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, drilling disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. It is uncertain what impact, if any, the Trump administration will have on this trend. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot provide assurances that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not materially affect us, we can provide no 
20

assurance that we will not incur substantial costs in the future related to revised or additional environmental regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, ("RCRA"), and comparable state statutes and their respective implementing regulations, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, most states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Federal and state regulatory agencies can seek to impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for alleged non-compliance with RCRA and analogous state requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil, if properly handled, are exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA. These wastes, instead, are regulated under RCRA's less stringent solid waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil exploration, development and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, ("CERCLA"), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons considered to be responsible for the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. These persons include the current and past owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek to recover from responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. Despite the so-called petroleum exclusion, we generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances.
We currently own and lease numerous properties that have been used for oil and/or natural gas exploration, production and processing for many years. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us, or on, under or from other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) and to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination.
Water Discharges
The federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including oil and hazardous substances, into state waters and federal navigable waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into federal or state waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state or tribal agency that has been delegated authority for the program by the EPA. Federal, state and tribal regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. Plan requirements imposed under the Clean Water Act require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws required individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended ("OPA"), amends the Clean Water Act and establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into waters of the United States. The OPA and its associated 
21

regulations impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. A "responsible party" under the OPA includes owners and operators of certain onshore facilities from which a release may affect waters of the United States
The Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended, (the "SDWA") and analogous state laws impose requirements relating to our underground injection activities. Under these laws, the EPA and state environmental agencies have adopted regulations related to permitting, testing, monitoring, record-keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as prohibitions against the migration of injected fluids into underground sources of drinking water. We currently own a number of injection wells, used primarily for reinjection of produced waters that are subject to SDWA requirements.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. We employ conventional hydraulic fracturing techniques to increase the productivity of certain of our properties. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the SDWA and has published guidance documents related to this regulatory authority. The Bureau of Land Management issued regulations, which have been challenged in court, for hydraulic fracturing on federal and tribal lands. In addition, Congress has considered federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing including disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Several states in which we operate, including Texas and Oklahoma, have adopted rules requiring the disclosure of certain information related to hydraulic fluids associated with wells that are hydraulically fractured. Additionally, some states and local governments have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. For example, the State of Arkansas established a moratorium on waste water injection from hydraulic fracturing activities in certain areas due to concern that such injection was related to increased earthquake activity. Similarly, the State of Oklahoma has issued directives to shut-in or reduce the volume sent to disposal wells in the areas that have experienced recent earthquake activity. Other authorities are considering restrictions on the disposal of hydraulic fluids by deepwell injection. We follow applicable industry standard practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. In the event that new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities.
There are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. Furthermore, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has completed a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources and issued its final report in December 2016. The report concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances and identified conditions under which such impacts can be more frequent or severe. In June 2016, the EPA published final pretreatment standards for oil and natural gas extraction to ensure that wastewater from hydraulic fracturing activities is not sent to publicly owned treatment works. Subsequent rules have extended the implementation date for certain facilities that are subject to these standards. The U.S. Department of Energy is conducting an investigation of practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic fracturing completion methods. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms.
Almost all of our hydraulic fracturing operations are conducted on vertical wells. The fracture treatments on these wells are much smaller and utilize much less water than what is typically used on most of the shale natural gas wells that are being drilled throughout the United States. We follow applicable industry standard practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our operations, subject to close supervision by state and federal regulators, which conduct many inspections during operations that include hydraulic fracturing. We minimize the use of water and dispose of the produced water into approved disposal or injection wells. We currently do not intentionally discharge water to the surface.
Air Emissions
The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of our projects.

While we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next few years for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues, we do not believe that such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations. For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA published final regulations under the Clean Air Act that, among other things, required additional emissions controls for natural gas and NGLs production, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds ("VOC"), and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with such production activities. The final regulations required the reduction of VOC emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or "green completions" on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. For well completion operations that occurred at such well sites before January 1, 2015, the final regulations allow operators to capture and direct flowback emissions to completion combustion devices, such as flares, in lieu of performing green completions. These regulations also established specific new requirements regarding emissions from dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. Compliance with these requirements could increase our costs of development and production, though we do not expect these requirements to be any more burdensome to us than to other similarly situated companies involved in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities.
Climate Change
In December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, or CO2, methane, and other greenhouse gases, or "GHG", present a danger to public health and the environment. Based on these findings, the EPA began adopting and implementing regulations that restrict emissions of GHG under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. These regulations include requirements to regulate emissions of GHG from motor vehicles, certain requirements for construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources including operators of onshore oil and natural gas production and rules requiring so-called green completions of natural gas wells for wells constructed after January 2015. In addition, pursuant to President Obama's strategy to reduce methane emissions, the EPA recently issued new regulations that set methane and VOC emission standards for certain oil and natural gas facilities. The Paris Agreement, which was created by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, was signed by President Obama on August 29, 2016, and went into effect on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement requires participating countries to establish "nationally determined contributions" to mitigate climate change that "represent a progression over time" and are reported at five-year intervals. It is not clear at this time if the Trump administration will remain committed to the Paris Agreement or other measures that have been implemented to reduce GHG emissions.
We are currently monitoring GHG emissions from our operations in accordance with the GHG emissions reporting rule. Data collected from our initial GHG monitoring activities indicated that we do not currently exceed the threshold level of GHG emissions triggering a reporting obligation. To the extent we exceed the applicable regulatory threshold level in the future, we will report the emissions beginning in the applicable period. Also, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHG and almost one-half of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of GHG. The adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHG from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur significant costs to reduce emissions of GHG associated with operations or could adversely affect demand for our production.
The EPA has also finalized regulations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the utility power sector, commonly referred to as the Clean Power Plan, which, if implemented, could reduce the demand for fossil fuels. The implementation of this rule has been stayed pending judicial review, and the Trump administration has indicated that it may revisit, modify or revoke the rule.
National Environmental Policy Act
Oil exploration, development and production activities that are located on federal lands or have a federal "nexus" are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended, ("NEPA"). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment that analyzes the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment. Future or proposed exploration and development plans on federal lands, governmental permits or authorizations that are subject to the requirements of NEPA may be required. This process has the potential to delay the development of oil projects.

Endangered Species Act
The federal Endangered Species Act ("ESA") may restrict activities that affect endangered or threatened species. Federal agencies are required to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or modify their critical habitat. While our facilities are located in areas that are not currently designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species habitats could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on September 9, 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to consider listing more than 250 species as endangered under the Endangered Species Act over a period of six years. The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.
OSHA
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, ("OSHA"), and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and implementing regulations, and similar state statutes and regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
General
Various aspects of our oil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation as the activities of the oil and natural gas industry often are reviewed by legislators and regulators. Numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue, and have issued, rules and regulations binding upon the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates, and terms and conditions of transportation service, which affects the marketing of the natural gas we produce, as well as the prices we receive for sales of our natural gas. FERC regulates interstate oil pipelines under the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act ("ICA") as in effect in 1977 when ICA jurisdiction over oil pipelines was transferred to FERC, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, or the EPA Act 1992. FERC is also authorized to prevent and sanction market manipulation in natural gas markets under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. In 1989, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas, effective January 1, 1993. While sales by producers of natural gas and all sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
In addition, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") hold statutory authority to prevent market manipulation in oil and energy futures markets, respectively. Together with FERC, these agencies have imposed broad rules and regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation in oil and natural gas markets and energy futures markets. We are also subject to various reporting requirements that are designed to facilitate transparency and prevent market manipulation. Failure to comply with such market rules, regulations and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Oil and NGLs Transportation Rates
Our sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are transacted at market prices. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the ICA and EPA act 1992. The price we receive from the sale of oil and NGLs is affected by the cost of transporting those products to market. Interstate transportation rates for oil, NGLs, and other products are regulated by the FERC, and in general, these rates must be cost-based or based on rates in effect in 1992, although FERC has established an indexing system for such transportation which allows such pipelines to take an annual inflation-based rate increase. Shippers may, however, contest rates that do not reflect costs of service. The FERC has also established market-based rates and settlement rates as alternative forms of ratemaking in certain circumstances.
24

In other instances involving intrastate-only transportation of oil, NGLs, and other products, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes. Such pipelines may be subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies with respect to safety, rates and/or terms and conditions of service, including requirements for ratable takes or non-discriminatory access to pipeline services. The basis for intrastate regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate pipelines varies from state to state. Many states operate on a complaint-based system and state commissions have generally not initiated investigations of the rates or practices of liquids pipelines in the absence of a complaint.
Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Exploration and Production
Our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Such regulations include requiring permits, bonds and pollution liability insurance for the drilling of wells, regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling, casing, operating, plugging and abandoning wells, notice to surface owners and other third parties, and governing the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled. Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation of oil and natural gas resources, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells and the regulation of spacing of such wells.
Oklahoma allows forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration, while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil wells generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.
States also impose severance taxes and enforce requirements for obtaining drilling permits. For example, the State of Oklahoma currently imposes a production tax and an excise tax for oil and natural gas properties. A portion of our wells in Oklahoma currently receive a reduced production tax rate due to the Enhanced Recovery Project Gross Production Tax Exemption. Additionally, production tax rates vary by state. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future.
In 2012, there were numerous new and proposed regulations related to oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
The oil and natural gas industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.
Pipeline Safety
While we do not own pipelines subject to safety regulation, we rely on such pipelines to deliver our production. Federal and state safety regulations have become increasingly more stringent over time and could affect the availability and cost of pipeline transportation to us.
Employees
The officers of our general partner manage our operations and activities. Neither we, our subsidiaries, nor our general partner have employees. Our general partner has entered into a services agreement with Mid-Con Energy Operating pursuant to which Mid-Con Energy Operating will perform services for us, including the operation of our properties. Mid-Con Energy Operating has over 70 employees performing services for our operations and activities. We believe that Mid-Con Energy Operating has a satisfactory relationship with these employees.
Offices
In addition to our oil and natural gas properties discussed above, we lease corporate office space in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and lease field office space in Abilene, Texas. Our affiliate, Mid-Con Energy Operating, maintains a number of field office locations. We believe that our existing office facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future.
