Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 Party City Holdco is a holding company with no operating assets or operations. Party City Holdco owns 100% of PC Nextco Holdings, LLC (PC Nextco), which owns 100% of PC Intermediate Holdings, Inc. (PC Intermediate). PC Intermediate owns 100% of Party City Holdings Inc. (PCHI). PCHI or its direct or indirect subsidiaries conduct most of our operations. The Companys principal executive offices are located at 80 Grasslands Road, Elmsford, New York 10523. 
 We are the leading party goods retailer by revenue in North America and, we believe, the largest vertically integrated supplier of decorated party goods globally by revenue. With over 900 locations (inclusive of franchised stores), we have the only coast-to-coast network of party superstores in the U.S. and Canada that make it easy and fun to enhance special occasions with a differentiated shopping experience and an unrivaled assortment of innovative and exciting merchandise offered at a compelling value. We also operate multiple e-commerce sites, principally under the domain name PartyCity.com, and during the Halloween selling season we open a network of approximately 250300 temporary stores under the Halloween City banner. 
 In addition to our retail operations, we are also one of the largest global designers, manufacturers and distributors of decorated party supplies, with products found in over 40,000 retail outlets worldwide, including

  independent party supply stores, mass merchants, grocery retailers and dollar stores. Our products are available in over 100 countries with the United Kingdom (U.K.), Canada, Germany, Mexico and Australia among the largest end markets for our products outside of the United States. During 2017, our third-party wholesale revenues were $629 million. 
 The 2005 combination of Amscan, which focused on the wholesale market, and Party City, which focused on the retail market, represented an important step in our evolution. Since the acquisition of Party City in 2005, we have steadily increased the selection of Amscan merchandise offered in Party City stores from approximately 25% to approximately 80% in 2017, allowing us to capture the full manufacturing-to-retail margin on a significant portion of our retail sales. 
 Through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions, we have been able to generate strong topline performance and margin expansion, including: 
 

 | Growing revenue from $2,045.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $2,371.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 3.8%.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Increasing adjusted EBITDA from $320.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $409.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Increasing adjusted net income from $68.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $148.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

 Industry Overview 
 We operate in the broadly defined $10 billion retail party goods industry (including decorative paper and plastic tableware, costumes, decorations, accessories and balloons), which is supported by a range of suppliers from commodity paper goods producers to party goods manufacturers. Sales of party goods are fueled by everyday events such as birthdays, baby showers, weddings and anniversaries, as well as seasonal events such as holidays and other special occasions. As a result of numerous and diverse occasions, the U.S. party goods market enjoys broad demographic appeal. We also operate in the $7 billion Halloween market, a portion of which overlaps with the $10 billion retail party goods industry. The Halloween market includes products that we sell such as costumes, candy and makeup. However, it also includes products and services which we do not supply, such as pumpkins, hay rides and haunted house tours. 
 The retail landscape is comprised primarily of party superstores, mass merchants, e-commerce merchandisers, craft stores, grocery retailers, and dollar stores. The party superstore has emerged as a preferred destination for party goods shoppers, similar to the dominance of specialty retailers in other categories such as home improvement, pet products and sporting goods. This is typically due to the superstore chains ability to offer a wider variety of merchandise at more compelling prices in a convenient setting as well as the knowledgeable staff often found at superstores. Other retailers that cater to the party goods market typically offer a limited assortment of party supplies and seasonal items. Mass merchants tend to focus primarily on juvenile and seasonal goods, greeting cards and gift wrap; craft stores on decorations and seasonal merchandise; and dollar stores on general and seasonal party goods items. 
 Segments 
 We have two reporting segments: Retail and Wholesale. In 2017, we generated 73.5% of our total revenues from our retail segment and 26.5% of our total revenues from our wholesale segment. 
 Our retail operations generate revenue primarily through the sale of our Amscan, Designware, Anagram and Costumes USA party supplies through our Party City stores, Halloween City stores and PartyCity.com. During 
 
2 


  2017, approximately 80% of the product that was sold by our retail operations was supplied by our wholesale operations and approximately 23% was self-manufactured. 
 Our wholesale revenues are generated from the sale of party goods for all occasions, including paper and plastic tableware, accessories and novelties, costumes, metallic and latex balloons and stationery. Our products are sold at wholesale to party goods superstores, including our franchise stores, other party goods retailers, mass merchants, independent card and gift stores, dollar stores and other retailers and distributors throughout the world. 
 Financial information about our business segments and geographical areas is provided in Note 15, Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Retail Operations 
 Overview 
 Opening its first company-owned store in 1986, Party City has grown to become what we believe is the largest operator of owned and franchised party superstores by revenue in the United States. At the time of the combination of Party City and Amscan in 2005, Party Citys network consisted of 502 stores, including 254 franchised locations. Since the acquisition, we have expanded the Party City network to approximately 880 superstore locations in the United States (inclusive of franchised stores) and approximately 60 locations in Canada. We also operate approximately 250300 temporary Halloween stores, under the Halloween City banner. 
 The following table shows the change in our company-owned Party City store network over the past three years: 
 

 | 2017 | | | 2016 | | 2015
Stores open at beginning of year | | 750 | | | 712 | | 693 | 
Stores opened | | 16 | | | 29 | | 27 | 
Stores acquired from franchisees/others | | 44 | | | 19 | | 6 | 
Stores closed | | (7 | ) | | (10 | ) | (14 | )
Stores open at end of year | | 803 | | | 750 | | 712 | 

 E-commerce
Our websites, including PartyCity.com, offer a convenient, user-friendly and secure online shopping option for new and existing customers. In addition to the ability to order products, our websites provide a substantial amount of content about our party products, party planning ideas and promotional offers. The websites are also one of our key marketing vehicles, specifically as they relate to social media marketing initiatives. 
Retail Advertising and Marketing 
 Our advertising focuses on promoting specific seasonal occasions and general party themes, with a strong emphasis on our price-value proposition, with the goal of increasing customer traffic and further building our brand. 
Competition at Retail 
 In our retail segment, our stores compete primarily on the basis of product assortment, store location and layout, customer convenience and value. Although we compete with a variety of smaller and larger retailers, 
 
3 


  including, but not limited to, independent party goods supply stores, specialty stores, dollar stores, e-commerce merchandisers, warehouse/merchandise clubs, drug stores, and mass merchants, we believe that, based on our revenues and strong brand awareness with our customers, our retail stores maintain a leading position in the party goods business by offering a wider breadth of merchandise than most competitors and a greater selection within merchandise classes, at a compelling value. We are one of only a few vertically integrated suppliers of decorated party goods. While some of our competitors in our markets may have greater financial resources, we believe that our significant buying power, which results from the size of our retail store network and the breadth of our assortment, is an important competitive advantage. Many of our retail competitors are also customers of our wholesale business. 
 Retail Seasonality 
 Our retail operations are subject to significant seasonal variations. Historically, this segment has realized a significant portion of its revenues, cash flow and net income in the fourth quarter of the year, principally due to our Halloween sales in October and, to a lesser extent, year-end holiday sales. Halloween business represents approximately 20% of our total domestic retail sales. To maximize our seasonal opportunity, we operate a chain of temporary Halloween stores, under the Halloween City banner, during the months of September and October of each year. During 2017, our temporary Halloween stores (including Canadian stores) generated revenues of approximately $54 million. 
Franchise Operations 
 We have franchised stores throughout the United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico run by franchisees utilizing our format, design specifications, methods, standards, operating procedures, systems and trademarks. Our wholesale sales to franchised stores generally mirror, with respect to relative size, mix and category, those to our company-owned stores. The following table shows the change in our franchise-owned store network over the past three years: 

 | 2017 | | | 2016 | | 2015
Stores open at beginning of year | | 184 | | | 200 | | 208 | 
Stores opened/acquired by existing franchisees | | 3 | | | 5 | |  | 
Stores sold to the Company | | (36 | ) | | (19 | ) | (6 | )
Stores closed or converted to independent stores | | (3 | ) | | (2 | ) | (2 | )
Stores open at end of year | | 148 | | | 184 | | 200 | 

 We are not currently marketing, nor do we plan to market, new franchise territories in the United States or Canada. However, in the future, we do plan on marketing new franchise territories internationally. During 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of Grupo Oprimax to franchise the Party City concept throughout Mexico. Under the terms of the agreement, Grupo Oprimax will have the exclusive right to open up Party City stores in Mexico. 
 We receive revenue from our franchisees, consisting of an initial one-time fee and ongoing royalty fees generally ranging from 4% to 6% of net sales. In exchange for these franchise fees, franchisees principally receive brand value and company support with respect to planograms. Each franchisee has a mandated advertising budget, which consists of a minimum initial store opening promotion and ongoing local advertising and promotions. Additionally, franchisees must pay 1% to 2.25% of net sales to a group advertising fund to cover common advertising materials. We do not offer financing to our franchisees for one-time fees or ongoing royalty fees. Our franchise agreements provide us with a right of first refusal should any franchisee look to dispose of its operations. 
 Current franchise agreements provide for an assigned area or territory that typically equals a three or four-mile radius from the franchisees store location and the right to use the Party City® logo and trademark. In

  addition, certain agreements with our franchisees and other business partners contain geographic limitations on opening new stores. For most stores, the franchisee or the majority owner of a corporate franchisee devotes full time to the management, operation and on-premises supervision of the stores or groups of stores. 
 Wholesale Operations 
 Overview 
 We currently offer over 400 party goods ensembles, which range from approximately five to 50 design-coordinated items spanning tableware, accessories, novelties, balloons and decorations. The breadth of these ensembles enables retailers to promote additional sales of related products for every occasion. To enhance our customers celebrations of lifes important events, we market party goods ensembles for a wide variety of occasions, including seasonal and religious holidays, special events and themed celebrations. 
 Our Amscan, Anagram, Costumes USA and Designware branded products are offered in over 40,000 retail outlets worldwide, ranging from party goods superstores, including our company-owned and franchised retail stores, other party goods retailers, mass merchants, independent card stores, dollar stores and other retailers and distributors throughout the world. We have long-term relationships with many of our wholesale customers. Party goods superstores, the Companys primary channel of distribution, provide consumers with a one-stop source for all of their party needs. Amscan, Anagram, Costumes USA and Designware branded products represent a significant portion of party goods carried by both company-owned and third-party stores with the overall percentage continuing to increase, reflecting the breadth of our product line and, based on our scale, our ability to manufacture and source quality products at competitive prices. 
 The table below shows the breakdown of our total wholesale sales by channel for the year ended December 31, 2017: 
 

Channel | Sales | 
 | (dollars in millions) | 
Party City and Halloween Cityowned stores and e-commerce | $ | 631 
Party City franchised stores and other domestic retailers | | 269 
Domestic balloon distributors/retailers | | 86

Wholesale Manufactured Products 
 In 2017, we manufactured items representing approximately 40% of our net sales at wholesale (including sales to our retail operations). Our manufacturing facilities in Minnesota, Kentucky, New York, Rhode Island, Malaysia, New Mexico, Mexico and Madagascar are generally highly automated and produce paper and plastic 
 
6 


  plates and cups, paper napkins, metallic and latex balloons, injection molded product, costumes, pinatas and other party and novelty items at globally competitive costs. State-of-the-art printing, forming, folding and packaging equipment support most of these manufacturing operations. Given our size and sales volume, we are generally able to operate our manufacturing equipment on the basis of at least two shifts per day, thus lowering production costs per unit. In select cases, we use available capacity to manufacture products for third parties, which allows us to maintain a satisfactory level of equipment utilization. 
 The table below summarizes our principal manufacturing facilities: 
 

Location | Principal Products | Approximate Square Feet
Monterrey, Mexico | Stickers, gift wrap, bags and invites | 355,500 
Newburgh, New York | Paper napkins and paper cups | 248,000 
East Providence, Rhode Island | Plastic plates, cups and bowls | 229,230(1) 
Louisville, Kentucky | Paper plates | 189,175 
Tijuana, Mexico | Piñatas and other party products | 135,000 
Eden Prairie, Minnesota | Metallic balloons and accessories | 115,600 
Melaka, Malaysia | Latex balloons | 100,000 
Los Lunas, New Mexico | Injection molded plastics | 85,055 
Antananarivo, Madagascar | Costumes | 41,000 


(1) | The square footage represents an industrial park, which includes a 48,455 square foot office and warehouse.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Complementing our manufacturing facilities, we have a diverse global network of third-party suppliers that supports our strategy of consistently offering a broad selection of high quality, innovative and competitively priced product. We have over 20-year relationships with many of our vendors and often represent a significant portion of their overall business. They generally produce items designed by and created for us, are located in Asia, and are managed by our sourcing office in Hong Kong. We actively work with our third-party suppliers to ensure product cost, quality and safety. 
 The principal raw materials used in manufacturing our products are paper, petroleum-based resin and cotton. While we currently purchase such raw material from a relatively small number of sources, paper, resin and cotton are available from numerous sources. Therefore, we believe our current suppliers could be replaced without adversely affecting our manufacturing operations in any material respect. 
 Wholesale Product Safety and Quality Assurance 
 We are subject to regulatory requirements in the United States and internationally, and we believe that all products that we manufacture and source comply with the requirements in the markets in which they are sold. Third-party manufactured products are tested both at the manufacturing site and upon arrival at our distribution centers. We have a full-time staff of professionals in the United States, Asia and Europe dedicated to product safety and quality assurance. 
Wholesale Distribution and Systems 
 We ship our products directly to retailers and distributors throughout the world from our distribution facilities, as well as on a free-on-board (FOB) basis directly from our domestic and international factories. Our electronic order entry and information systems allow us to manage our inventory with minimal obsolescence while maintaining strong fill rates and quick order turnaround time. 
 Our main distribution facility for domestic party customers is located in Chester, New York, with nearly 900,000 square feet under one roof. This state-of-the-art facility serves as the main point of distribution for our Amscan-branded products and utilizes paperless, pick-by-light systems, offering superior inventory management and turnaround times as short as 48 hours. 
 
7 


 We utilize a bypass system which allows us to ship products directly from selected third-party suppliers to our company-owned and franchised stores, thus bypassing our distribution facilities. In addition to lowering our distribution costs, this bypass system creates warehouse capacity. 
 The distribution center for our retail e-commerce platform is located in Naperville, Illinois. We also have other distribution centers in the U.K., Germany and Mexico to support our international customers. 
 Wholesale Customers 
 We have a diverse third party customer base at wholesale. During 2017, no individual third party customer accounted for more than 10% of our total third-party sales at wholesale. 
Competition at Wholesale 
 In our wholesale segment, we compete primarily on the basis of diversity and quality of our product designs, breadth of product line, product availability, price, reputation and customer service. Although we have many competitors with respect to one or more of our products, we believe that there are no competitors who design, manufacture, source and distribute products with the complexity of design and breadth of product lines that we do. Furthermore, our design and manufacturing processes create efficiencies in manufacturing that few of our competitors can achieve in the production of numerous coordinated products in multiple design types. Competitors include smaller independent manufacturers and distributors, as well as divisions or subsidiaries of large companies. Certain of these competitors control various party goods product licenses for widely recognized images, such as cartoon or motion picture characters, which could provide them with a competitive advantage. However, we control a strong portfolio of character licenses for use in the design and production of our metallic balloons and we have access to a strong portfolio of character and other licenses for party goods. 
Information Systems 
 We continually evaluate and upgrade our information systems to enhance the quantity, quality and timeliness of information available to management and to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing and distribution facilities, as well as our service at the store level. We have implemented merchandise replenishment software to complement our distribution, planning and allocation processes. The system enhances the store replenishment function by improving in-stock positions, leveraging our distribution infrastructure and allowing us to become more effective in our use of store labor. We have implemented a Point of Sale system and upgraded merchandising systems to standardize technology across all of our domestic retail superstores and we have implemented similar systems at our temporary Halloween City locations. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 9,400 full-time employees and 10,400 part-time employees, none of whom is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
Intellectual Property 
 We own the copyrights in the designs we create and use on our products and various trademarks and service marks used on or in connection with our products. It is our practice to register our copyrights with the United States Copyright Office and our trademarks and service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or with other foreign jurisdictions, to the extent we deem necessary. In addition, we rely on unregistered common law trademark rights and unregistered copyrights under applicable U.S. law to distinguish and/or protect our products, services and branding. We do not believe that the loss of copyrights or trademarks with respect to any particular product or products would have a material adverse effect on our business. We hold numerous 
 
8 


  intellectual property licenses from third parties, allowing us to use various third-party cartoon and other characters and designs on our products, and the images on our metallic balloons and costumes are principally covered by these licenses. None of these licenses is individually material to our aggregate business. We also own patents relating to display racks and balloon weights, none of which is individually material to our aggregate business. 
 We permit our franchisees to use a number of our trademarks and service marks, including Party City, The Discount Party Super Store, Party America and Halloween City. 
 Government Regulation 
 As a franchisor, we must comply with regulations adopted by the Federal Trade Commission, such as the Trade Regulation Rule on Franchising, which requires us, among other things, to furnish prospective franchisees with a franchise offering circular. We also must comply with a number of state laws that regulate the offer and sale of our franchises and certain substantive aspects of franchisor-franchisee relationships. These laws vary in their application and in their regulatory requirements. State laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises typically require us to, among other things, register before the offer and sale of a franchise can be made in that state and to provide a franchise offering circular to prospective franchisees. 
 State laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states. Those laws regulate the franchise relationship, for example, by restricting a franchisors rights with regard to the termination, transfer and renewal of a franchise agreement (for example, by requiring good cause to exist as a basis for the termination and the franchisors decision to refuse to permit the franchisee to exercise its transfer or renewal rights), by requiring the franchisor to give advance notice to the franchisee of the termination and give the franchisee an opportunity to cure most defaults. To date, those laws have not precluded us from seeking franchisees in any given area and have not had a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 Our wholesale and retail segments must also comply with applicable regulations adopted by federal agencies, including product safety regulations, and with licensing and other regulations enforced by state and local health, sanitation, safety, fire and other departments. Difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals can delay and sometimes prevent the opening of a new store or the shutting down of an existing store. 
 Our manufacturing operations, stores and other facilities must comply with applicable environmental, health and safety regulations, although the cost of complying with these regulations to date has not been material. More stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use, and environmental factors can delay, and sometimes prevent, development of new stores in particular locations. Our stores must comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act and various state laws governing various matters such as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions. Our stores must also comply with the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires that employers provide reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities and that stores must be accessible to customers with disabilities.
