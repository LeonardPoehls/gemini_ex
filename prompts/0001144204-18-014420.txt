Organization 
 Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc. (we, us, or the Company) was incorporated on July 25, 2008 under the laws of the state of Maryland. 
 We have elected to be treated, and currently qualify, as a real estate investment trust (or REIT) for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to corporate-level income taxes. To maintain our REIT status, we are required, among other requirements, to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. We were incorporated to raise capital and acquire a diverse portfolio of residential real estate assets. 
 On August 4, 2017, we announced that we, Bluerock Residential Holdings, L.P., the Companys operating partnership (the Operating Partnership), and Bluerock TRS Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership (the OP Sub) had entered into a Contribution and Sale Agreement (as amended by that certain Amendment No. 1 thereto, dated August 9, 2017) (the Contribution Agreement) with BRG Manager, LLC (our former Manager), Bluerock REIT Operator, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of our former Manager (the Manager Sub), and Bluerock Real Estate, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company controlled by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, R. Ramin Kamfar (BRRE), our Chief Investment Officer, James G. Babb, III (Mr. Babb); our Chief Operating Officer and President, Jordan B. Ruddy (Mr. Ruddy); our Chief Acquisitions Officer, Ryan S. MacDonald (Mr. MacDonald); and Konig & Associates, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company controlled by our Chief Legal Officer and Secretary, Michael L. Konig (Konig & Associates); Jenco Business Advisors, Inc., a New York corporation controlled by Jerold E. Novack (Jenco); and The Kachadurian Group, LLC, an Illinois limited liability company controlled by a member of our board of directors, Gary T. Kachadurian (Kachadurian Group, and collectively with BRRE, Mr. Babb, Mr. Ruddy, Mr. MacDonald, Konig & Associates, and Jenco, the Contributors). The Contribution Agreement, and other definitive agreements entered into by the parties, provided for our acquisition of a newly-formed entity to own the assets used by the former Manager in its performance of the management functions then provided to us pursuant to a Management Agreement (the Internalization). A special committee comprised entirely of independent and disinterested members of our board of directors (the Special Committee), which retained independent legal and financial advisors, unanimously determined that the entry into the Contribution Agreement and the completion of the Internalization were in the best interests of the Company. Our board of directors, by unanimous vote, made a similar determination, and on October 26, 2017, the Company held its annual meeting of stockholders, at which our stockholders approved the proposals necessary for the completion of the Internalization. 
 On October 31, 2017, we completed the Internalization pursuant to the Contribution Agreement for total consideration of approximately $41.24 million, as determined pursuant to a formula established in the Management Agreement at the time of our initial public offering (the IPO) in April 2014. Upon completion of the Internalization, our current management and investment teams, who were previously employed by an affiliate of our former Manager, became employed by our indirect subsidiary, and we become an internally managed real estate investment trust. In order to further align the interests of our management with those of our stockholders, payment of the aggregate Internalization consideration was paid 99.9% in equity: we caused our Operating Partnership to issue an aggregate of 3,753,593 units of limited partnership interest in our Operating Partnership (OP Units), and we issued an aggregate of 76,603 shares of a newly reclassified Class C common stock and paid an aggregate of approximately $40,794 in cash to the applicable Contributor and its affiliates and related persons in connection with the Internalization. 
 Following the Internalization, our senior management team continues to oversee, manage and operate the Company, and we are no longer externally managed by our former Manager. As an internally managed company, we no longer pay the former Manager any fees or expense reimbursements arising from the Management Agreement.

Business and Growth Strategies 
 Our principal business objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted investment returns by assembling a high-quality portfolio of apartment properties located in demographically attractive growth markets and by implementing our investment strategies and our Live/Work/Play Initiatives to achieve sustainable long-term growth in both our funds from operations and net asset value. 
 Invest in Institutional-Quality Apartment Properties.  We acquire institutional-quality apartment properties where we believe we can create long-term value for our stockholders utilizing our Core-Plus, Value-Add, Opportunistic and Invest-to-Own investment strategies. 
 
 | Core-Plus. We invest in institutional-quality apartment properties with strong and stable cash flows in target markets where we believe there exists opportunity for rental growth and with potential for further value creation. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Value-Add. We invest in well-located apartment properties that offer significant potential for medium-term capital appreciation through repositioning, renovation or redevelopment, to reposition the asset and drive future rental growth. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Opportunistic. We invest in properties available at opportunistic prices (i.e., at prices we believe are below those available in an otherwise efficient market) that exhibit some characteristics of distress, such as operational inefficiencies, significant deferred capital maintenance or broken capital structures providing an opportunity for a substantial portion of total return attributable to appreciation in value. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Invest-to-Own. We selectively invest in development of Class A properties in target markets where we believe we can capture significant development premiums upon completion. We generally use a mezzanine loan with an option to purchase common equity in the project or convertible preferred equity structure, both of which provide income during the development stage, while providing us the ability to capture development premiums at completion by exercising our rights to take ownership. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Invest in Class A Apartment Properties.  We intend to continue to acquire primarily Class A apartment properties targeting the high disposable income renter by choice, where we believe we can create long-term value growth for our stockholders. 
 Focus on Growth Markets.  We intend to continue to focus on demographically attractive growth markets, which we define as markets with strong employment drivers in industries creating high disposable income jobs over the long term. Employment growth is highly correlated with apartment demand; therefore, we believe that selecting markets with job growth significantly above the national average will provide high potential for increase rental demand leading to revenue growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
 Implement our Value Creation Strategies.  We intend to continue to focus on creating value at our properties utilizing our Core-Plus, Value-Add, Opportunistic and Invest-to-Own investment strategies in order to maximize our return on investment. We will work with each member of our network to evaluate property needs along with value-creation opportunities and create an asset-specific business plan to best position or

 reposition each property to drive rental growth and asset values. We then provide an aggressive asset management presence to manage our network partner and ensure execution of the plan, with the goal of driving rental growth and values. 
 Implement our Live/Work/Play Initiatives.  We intend to continue to implement our amenities and attributes to transform the apartment community from a purely functional product (i.e., as solely a place to live), to a lifestyle product (i.e., as a place to live, interact, and socialize). Our Live/Work/Play initiatives are property specific, and generally consist of attributes that go beyond traditional features, including highly amenitized common areas, cosmetic and architectural improvements, technology, music and other community-oriented activities to appeal to our residents desire for a sense of community by creating places to gather, socialize and interact in an amenity-rich environment. We believe this creates an enhanced perception of value among residents, allowing for premium rental rates and improved resident retention. 
 Diversify Across Markets, Strategies and Investment Size.  We will seek to grow our high-quality portfolio of apartment properties diversified by geography and by investment strategy and by size (typically ranging from $50 to $100 million) in order to manage concentration risk, while driving both current income and capital appreciation throughout the portfolio. Our network enables us to diversify across multiple markets and multiple strategies efficiently, without the logistical burden and time delay of building operating infrastructure in multiple markets and across multiple investment strategies. 
 Selectively Harvest and Redeploy Capital.  On an opportunistic basis and subject to compliance with certain REIT restrictions, we intend to sell properties in cases where we have successfully executed our value creation plans and where we believe the investment has limited additional upside relative to other opportunities, in order to harvest profits and to reinvest proceeds to maximize stockholder value.

Management Internalization 
 On August 4, 2017, we announced that we, Bluerock Residential Holdings, L.P., the Companys operating partnership (the Operating Partnership), and Bluerock TRS Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership (the OP Sub), and our former Manager and the contributors had entered into definitive agreements, as amended, (the Contribution Agreement) which provided for the acquisition (the Internalization) by the Company of a newly-formed entity that will own the assets that our former Manager used to operate the business of the Company. 
 A special committee comprised entirely of independent and disinterested members of our board of directors (the Special Committee), which retained independent legal and financial advisors, unanimously determined that the entry into the Contribution Agreement and the completion of the Internalization are in the best interests of the Company. Our board of directors, by unanimous vote, made a similar determination. 
 The closing of the Internalization was subject to certain approvals of the Companys stockholders on certain matters contemplated by the Contribution Agreement. The Company held its Annual Meeting on October 26, 2017, at which the Companys stockholders approved the proposal authorizing the issuances, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, of (i) the Internalization OP Units, and shares of our Class A Common Stock that may be issued in the Companys discretion upon redemption of such Internalization OP Units on a one-for-one basis in certain circumstances contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, and (ii) the Internalization Class C Shares, and shares of our Class A Common Stock that may be issued upon conversion of such Internalization Class C Shares on a one-for-one basis in certain circumstances contemplated by the Contribution Agreement. 
 The Internalization was consummated for a purchase price of approximately $41.24 million, payable 99.9% in equity and 0.1% in cash. Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, the aggregate amount of consideration payable in connection with the Internalization (the Internalization Consideration) was determined pursuant to a formula established in the Management Agreement at the time of the Companys IPO in April 2014. Specifically, the Internalization Consideration was an amount equal to three (3) times the sum of (i) the Base Management Fee and (ii) the Incentive Fee, in each case earned by the former Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement during the 12-month period ending on September 30, 2017 (the last day of the most recently-completed fiscal quarter prior to closing), which amount was reduced by the portion of actual former Manager costs to be paid by the Company up to $450,000. This amount was further reduced by the value of such Internalization Consideration payable in cash in the approximate amount of $40,794 (the Cash Consideration) to arrive at the value of the Internalization Consideration payable in OP Units and shares of Class C Common Stock, in the approximate amount of $40.75 million (the Contribution Consideration). 
 Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, the number of OP Units and shares of Class C Common Stock issuable as Internalization Consideration was determined by dividing the proportionate amounts of such Contribution Consideration payable (a) in OP Units, in the approximate amount of $39.94 million, and (b) in shares of Class C Common Stock, in the approximate amount of $815,060, in each case by the volume-weighted average price of the Companys Class A Common Stock on the NYSE American (formerly the NYSE MKT) for the twenty (20) trading days beginning on and including September 11, 2017, through and including October 6, 2017, of $10.64 per share (the VWAP). In payment of the Internalization Consideration, the Company has caused the Operating Partnership to issue to the Contributors an aggregate of 3,753,593 OP Units (the Internalization OP Units), and the Company has issued to the Contributors an aggregate of 76,603 shares of its newly reclassified Class C Common Stock (the Internalization Class C Shares) and an aggregate of approximately $40,794 in cash. Payment of the Internalization Consideration primarily in OP Units and Class C Common Stock, rather than principally in cash, was intended to further align the interests of our management with those of our stockholders.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Upon closing of the Internalization, the Company became a self-managed real estate investment trust. The following key executives and officers of the former Manager assumed the following titles and duties with the Company: Mr. R. Ramin Kamfar serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mr. James G, Babb, III, serves as Chief Investment Officer; Mr. Ryan S. MacDonald serves as Chief Acquisitions Officer; Mr. Jordan B. Ruddy serves as Chief Operating Officer and President; Mr. Christopher J. Vohs serves as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Mr. Michael L. Konig serves as Chief Legal Officer and Secretary. Messrs. Kamfar, Babb, MacDonald, Ruddy and Vohs have entered into employment agreements with an indirect subsidiary of the Company, and Mr. Konig has likewise entered into a services agreement with that subsidiary through his wholly-owned law firm, Konig & Associates, LLC, on substantially the same terms as the employment agreements. Each such agreement became effective upon closing, and has an initial term through and including December 31, 2020. As such, following the Internalization, the Companys senior management team continues to oversee, manage and operate the Company, and the Company is no longer externally managed by the former Manager. As an internally managed company, the Company no longer pays our former Manager any fees or expense reimbursements arising from the Management Agreement. 
Distribution Policy 
 We intend to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. The Code generally requires that a REIT annually distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain, and imposes tax on any taxable income retained by a REIT, including capital gains. 
 To satisfy the requirements for qualification as a REIT and generally not be subject to federal income and excise tax, we intend to continue to make regular distributions of all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to dividends paid, to our stockholders out of assets legally available for such purposes. All future distributions will be determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors on a quarterly basis. When determining the amount of future distributions, we expect that our board of directors will consider, among other factors, (i) the amount of cash generated from our operating activities, (ii) our expectations of future operating cash flows, (iii) our determination of near-term cash needs for acquisitions of new properties, development investments general property capital improvements and debt repayments, (iv) our ability to continue to access additional sources of capital, (v) the requirements of Maryland law, (vi) the amount required to be distributed to maintain our status as a REIT and to reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay and (vii) any limitations on our distributions contained in our credit or other agreements. 
 Holders of shares of 8.250% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Series A Preferred Stock), will be entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us from the end of the most recent dividend period for which dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock have been paid, payable quarterly in arrears on each January 5th, April 5th, July 5th and October 5th of each year, commencing on January 5, 2016, to holders of record on each December 25th, March 25th, June 25th and September 25th, respectively. From the date of original issue to, but not including, October 21, 2022, we will pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock at the rate of 8.250% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to the fixed annual amount of $2.0625 per share). Commencing October 21, 2022, we will pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock at an annual dividend rate of the initial rate increased by 2.0% of the liquidation preference per annum, which will increase by an additional 2.0% of the liquidation preference per annum on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, subject to a maximum annual dividend rate of 14.0%. 
 Holders of shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Series B Preferred Stock), are entitled to receive, when and as authorized by our board of directors and declared by us out of legally available funds, cumulative cash dividends on each share of Series B Preferred Stock at an annual rate of six percent (6%) of the initial stated value of $1,000 per share (the Stated Value). Dividends on each share of Series B Preferred Stock will begin accruing on, and will be cumulative from, the date of issuance or the end of the most recent dividend period for which dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been paid, payable monthly in arrears on the 5th day of each month to holders of record on the 25th day of the prior month.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Holders of shares of 7.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Series C Preferred Stock), will be entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us from and including the date of original issue or the end of the most recent dividend period for which dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock have been paid, payable quarterly in arrears on each January 5th, April 5th, July 5th and October 5th of each year, commencing on October 5, 2016, to holders of record on each December 25th, March 25th, June 25th and September 25th, respectively. From the date of original to, but not including, July 19, 2023, we will pay dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock at the rate of 7.625% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to the fixed annual amount of $1.90625 per share). Commencing July 19, 2023, we will pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock at an annual dividend rate of the initial rate increased by 2.0% of the liquidation preference per annum, which will increase by an additional 2.0% of the liquidation preference per annum on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, subject to a maximum annual dividend rate of 14.0%. 
 Holders of shares of 7.125% Series D Cumulative Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Series D Preferred Stock), will be entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us from and including the date of original issue or the end of the most recent dividend period for which dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock have been paid, payable quarterly in arrears on each January 5th, April 5th, July 5th and October 5th of each year, commencing on January 5, 2017, to holders of record on each December 25th, March 25th, June 25th and September 25th, respectively. From the date of original issue, we will pay dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock at the rate of 7.1250% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to the fixed annual amount of $1.78125 per share). 
 Holders of shares of Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Class A common stock), and Class C common stock $0.01 par value per share (the Class C common stock), will be entitled to receive cash dividends when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us. 
 On December 20, 2017, the Company announced a revised dividend policy for the Companys Class A common stock, which will also be applicable to the Class C common stock, and set an annual dividend rate of $0.65 per common share. The common share dividend will be paid on a quarterly basis, a change from previously being paid on a monthly basis. The board of directors considered a number of factors in setting the new common stock dividend rate, including but not limited to achieving a sustainable dividend covered by current recurring AFFO (vs. pro forma AFFO), multifamily and small cap peer dividend rates and payout ratios, providing financial flexibility for the Company, and achieving an appropriate balance between the retention of capital to invest and grow net asset value and the importance of current distributions. 
 We cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flows to make distributions to our stockholders, or that we will be able to sustain those distributions. If our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to allow us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements, we may be required to fund distributions from working capital, offering proceeds, borrow funds, sell assets, make a taxable distribution of our equity or debt securities, or reduce such distributions. Our distribution policy enables us to review the alternative funding sources available to us from time to time. Our actual results of operations will be affected by a number of factors, including the revenues we receive from our properties, our operating expenses, interest expense, the ability of our tenants to meet their obligations and unanticipated expenditures. For more information regarding risk factors that could materially adversely affect our actual results of operations, please see Item 1A  Risk Factors.

Industry Segment 
 Our current business consists of investing in and operating multifamily communities. A significant portion of our consolidated net income (loss) is from investments in real estate properties that we own through joint ventures. We internally evaluate operating performance on an individual property level and view our real estate assets as one industry segment, and, accordingly, our properties are aggregated into one reportable segment.
