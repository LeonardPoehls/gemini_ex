Recent Development - Proposed Acquisition by Restaurant Brands International
 On February 21, 2017, the Company entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Restaurant Brands International Inc. (“Restaurant Brands International” or “RBI”) pursuant to which RBI will acquire the Company. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, an affiliate of RBI will commence a cash tender offer (the “Offer”) to purchase all of the outstanding shares of our common stock for $79.00 per share in cash. Following the completion of the Offer, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement filed as Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 22, 2017. The completion of the acquisition, which we expect will occur in early April 2017, is subject to customary conditions. See also “Risk Factors-Our proposed acquisition by Restaurant Brands International is subject to various risks and uncertainties” for a discussion of some of the most material risks related to our pending acquisition.
Popeyes Profile
Popeyes was founded in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1972 and is the world’s second largest quick-service chicken concept based on the number of units. Within the Quick Service Restaurant (“QSR”) industry, Popeyes distinguishes itself with a unique “Louisiana” style menu that features spicy chicken, chicken tenders, fried shrimp and other seafood, red beans and rice and other regional items. Popeyes is a highly differentiated QSR brand with a passion for its Louisiana heritage and flavorful, authentic food.
As of December 25, 2016, we operated and franchised 2,688 Popeyes restaurants in 48 states, the District of Columbia, three territories and 25 foreign countries.
As of December 25, 2016, of our 2,012 domestic franchised restaurants, approximately 67% were concentrated in Texas, California, Florida, New York, Louisiana, Illinois, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, Virginia, and Mississippi. Of our 621 international franchised restaurants, approximately 62% were located in Turkey, Canada, and South Korea. Of our 55 company-operated restaurants, approximately 84% were concentrated in Louisiana, North Carolina, and Tennessee.
Financial information concerning our domestic and international operations can be found in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Business Strategy
In February 2016, the Company defined a set of growth goals to deliver over the next seven to ten years:

• | Drive our domestic restaurant average unit volumes from $1.4 million to $2.0 million;


• | Drive domestic franchisee profitability from $333,000 to $500,000 per restaurant; and


• | Continue to expand Popeyes brand globally, increasing restaurant count from 2,500 to 4,000 restaurants.

To deliver these growth goals, the Company introduced its next generation strategic roadmap organized around three strategic pillars:

1. | Louisiana Heritage — the source of our relevant, distinctive brand.


2. | Passionate Teams — our conviction that people drive restaurant profitability.


3. | Routine Excellence — our commitment to consistent operational excellence in our restaurants. 

The first pillar is our Louisiana Heritage, marking the rich traditions of Popeyes’ birthplace and differentiating us from all our competitors. Our Louisiana Heritage will serve as the foundation on which everything else is built. The characteristics of Louisiana provide a platform for ongoing culinary innovation, creating distinctive building design and exuding warm Louisiana hospitality. 
Our second strategic pillar, Passionate Teams, represents our belief in people as the driver of profitability. Engaged passionate teams will deliver a superior guest experience that results in more loyal customers that revisit our Popeyes restaurants more often, driving sales and profits for our franchisees and shareholder returns for our investors, and giving back to the communities where we serve. 
Our third strategic pillar, Routine Excellence, is about delivering operational consistency in our restaurants. 
The three strategic pillars will be enabled by One Technology, an initiative to build a common technology platform for the Popeyes system that will bring together innovative systems to better support our restaurant general managers, while improving the experience of our team members and guests.
We will continue to accelerate our international unit growth. Our primary focus will be the traditional franchising model, supported with brand-building media and innovative new products to create awareness and trial of our Louisiana Heritage.  We will selectively consider direct capital investments where we believe opportunities exist to unlock new unit growth.

Additionally, we will continue to make select investments in domestic Company-operated restaurants to lead the system on matters such as real estate selection, store design and layout, and people practices.
Binding our culture and our new roadmap together is our brand purpose, Food That Ignites Our Desire to Serve®. Our brand purpose and the principles that support it are a meaningful belief system that defines our food, our people and our focus on the guest. These beliefs will guide our franchisees, restaurant general managers, and team members in a way that we believe will sustain superior performance results. 
Our Agreements with Popeyes Franchisees
Our strategy places a heavy emphasis on increasing the number of restaurants in the Popeyes system through franchising activities. As of December 25, 2016, we had 365 franchisees operating restaurants within the Popeyes system, and several preparing to become franchisee operators. Our largest domestic franchisee operates 190 restaurants and our largest international franchisee operates 162 restaurants. The following discussion describes the standard arrangements we enter into with our Popeyes franchisees.
Domestic Development Agreements. Our domestic franchise development agreements provide for the development of a specified number of Popeyes restaurants within a defined geographic territory. Generally, these agreements call for the development of the restaurants over a specified period of time, usually three to five years, with targeted opening dates for each restaurant. Our Popeyes franchisees currently pay a development fee ranging from $7,500 to $22,500 per restaurant. Typically these development fees are paid when the agreement is executed, and are non-refundable.
Domestic Franchise Agreements. Following the execution of a development agreement, we enter into franchise agreements with our franchisees that convey the right to operate a specific Popeyes restaurant at a site to be selected by the franchisee and approved by us within 180 days from the execution of the franchise agreement. Our current franchise agreements generally provide for payment of a franchise fee of $22,500 per location.
These agreements generally require franchisees to pay a 5% royalty on net restaurant sales. In addition, franchisees must contribute to national and local advertising funds. Payments to the advertising funds are generally 4% of net restaurant sales. Some of our institutional franchise agreements provide for lower royalties and advertising fund contributions.
Development Incentive Programs. We have established development incentive programs to encourage franchisees to develop and open new Popeyes restaurants. Based on the terms of the programs, franchise fees can be waived or reduced in addition to royalty rate percentages reductions.
International Development Agreements. Our international franchise development agreements are similar to our domestic franchise development agreements, though the development time frames can be longer and with development fees of up to $15,000 for each restaurant developed. Depending on the market, limited sub-franchising rights may also be granted.
International Franchise Agreements. The terms of our international franchise agreements are substantially similar to those included in our domestic franchise agreements, except that these agreements may be modified to reflect the multi-national nature of the transaction and to comply with the requirements of applicable local laws. Our current international franchise agreements generally provide for payment of a franchise fee of up to $30,000 per location. In addition, the effective royalty rates may differ from those included in domestic franchise agreements, and may be lower due to the greater number of restaurants required to be developed by our international franchisees.
All of our franchise agreements require that our franchisees operate restaurants in accordance with our defined operating procedures, adhere to the menu established by us, and meet applicable quality, service, health and cleanliness standards. We may terminate the franchise rights of any franchisee who does not comply with these standards and requirements.
Site Selection
 For new domestic restaurants, we assist our franchisees in evaluating sites consistent with the overall market plan for each development area. Domestically, we primarily emphasize freestanding sites with drive-thrus and in limited situations where there is a compelling need in dense areas we may pursue other venues such as “end-cap, in-line” strip-mall sites with ample parking and easy access from high traffic roads.
Each international market has its own factors that lead to venue and site determination. In international markets, we use different venues including freestanding, in-line, food court and other nontraditional venues. Market development strategies are a collaborative process between Popeyes and our franchisees located in the particular market so we can leverage local knowledge.
Suppliers and Purchasing Cooperative
2

Suppliers. Our franchisees are required to purchase all ingredients, products, materials, supplies and other items necessary in the operation of their businesses solely from suppliers who have been approved by us. These suppliers are required to meet or exceed strict quality control standards, and they must possess adequate capacity to supply our restaurant system reliably.
Purchasing Cooperative. Supplies are generally provided to our domestic franchised and Company-operated restaurants pursuant to supply agreements negotiated by Supply Management Services, Inc. (“SMS”), a not-for-profit purchasing cooperative. We and our Popeyes franchisees hold membership interests in SMS in proportion to the number of restaurants owned. As of December 25, 2016, we held two of seven seats on the SMS board of directors and our voting interests were approximately 2.5%. Our Popeyes franchise agreements require that each domestic franchisee join SMS.
Supply Agreements. The principal raw material for a Popeyes restaurant operation is fresh chicken. Company-operated and franchised restaurants purchase their chicken from suppliers who service the Popeyes system. In order to ensure favorable pricing and to secure an adequate supply of fresh chicken, SMS has entered into supply agreements with several chicken suppliers. These contracts, which pertain to the vast majority of our system-wide purchases, are “cost-plus” contracts with prices based partially upon the cost of feed grains plus certain agreed upon non-feed and processing costs.
We have entered into long-term beverage supply arrangements with certain major beverage vendors. These contracts are customary in the QSR industry. Pursuant to the terms of these arrangements, marketing rebates are provided to the owner/operator of Popeyes restaurants based upon the volume of beverage purchases.
We also have a long-term agreement with an exclusive supplier of certain proprietary products for the Popeyes system. This supplier sells these products to our approved distributors, who in turn sell them to our franchised and Company-operated Popeyes restaurants.
Marketing and Advertising
Each Popeyes restaurant, Company-operated or franchised, contributes to an advertising fund that supports (1) branding and marketing initiatives, including the development of marketing materials that are used throughout our restaurant system and (2) national and local marketing programs. We act as the agent for the advertising fund and coordinate its activities. We and our Popeyes franchisees made contributions to the advertising fund of approximately $135.1 million in 2016, $123.5 million in 2015, and $110.2 million in 2014.
Fiscal Year and Seasonality
During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the fiscal year included 52 weeks and our fiscal year was composed of 13 four-week accounting periods and ended on the last Sunday in December. The first quarter of our fiscal year has four periods, or 16 weeks. All other quarters have three periods, or 12 weeks.
Seasonality has little effect on our operations.
Employees
As of January 22, 2017, we had approximately 1,604 hourly employees working in our Company-operated restaurants. Additionally, we had approximately 67 employees involved in the management of our Company-operated restaurants, comprised of restaurant managers, multi-unit managers and field management employees. We also had approximately 227 employees responsible for corporate administration, franchise services and business development.
None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that the dedication of our employees is critical to our success and that our relationship with our employees is good.
Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
We own a number of trademarks and service marks that have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or for which we have made application to register, including “Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen,” “Popeyes,” “Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits,” and the brand logos for Popeyes and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. In addition, we have registered, or made application to register, one or more of these marks and others, or their linguistic equivalents, in foreign countries in which we do business, or are contemplating doing business. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the registration for the marks in every country where registration has been sought. We consider our intellectual property rights to be important to our business and we actively defend and enforce them.
3

International Operations
We continue to expand our international operations through franchising. As of December 25, 2016, we had 621 franchised international restaurants. During 2016, franchise revenues from these operations represented approximately 10.9%, of our total franchise revenues. For each of 2016, 2015, and 2014, international revenues represented 6.3%, 5.9%, and 6.4% of total revenues, respectively.
Insurance
We carry property, general liability, business interruption, crime, director's and officer’s liability, privacy and network liability, employment practices liability, environmental and workers’ compensation insurance policies, which we believe are customary for businesses of our size and type. Pursuant to the terms of their franchise agreements, our franchisees are also required to maintain certain types and levels of insurance coverage, including commercial general liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, special perils property and automobile insurance.
Competition
The foodservice industry, and particularly the QSR industry, is intensely competitive with respect to price, quality, name recognition, service and location. We compete against other QSRs, including chicken, hamburger, pizza, and sandwich restaurants, other purveyors of carry-out food and convenience dining establishments, including national restaurant and grocery chains. Many of our competitors possess substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do.
Government Regulation
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business, including various health, sanitation, labor, fire and safety standards. Newly constructed or remodeled restaurants are subject to state and local building code and zoning requirements. In connection with the re-imaging and alteration of our Company-operated restaurants, we may be required to expend funds to meet certain federal, state and local regulations, including regulations requiring that remodeled or altered restaurants be accessible to persons with disabilities. Difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of new restaurants in particular areas.
We are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act and various other laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, overtime and other working conditions and citizenship requirements. A significant number of our foodservice personnel are paid at rates related to the federal or state minimum wage, and increases in the minimum wage have increased our labor costs.
Many states and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as certain foreign countries, require franchisors to transmit specified disclosure documents to potential franchisees before granting a franchise. Additionally, some states and certain foreign countries require us to register our franchise disclosure documents before we may offer a franchise.
We have franchise agreements related to the operation of restaurants located on various U.S. military bases which are with certain governmental agencies and are subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of the U.S. government. During 2016, royalty revenues from these restaurants were approximately $2.3 million.
Enterprise Risk Management
We have developed and implemented an Enterprise Risk Management program. The purpose of the program is to provide us with a systematic approach to identify and evaluate risks to the business, and provide us an effective manner of risk management and control. The Enterprise Risk Management program is designed to integrate risk management into our culture and strategic decision making , and to help the organization more effectively and efficiently drive performance. The Enterprise Risk Management program encompasses all aspects of our business, including, without limitation, financial, operational, reputational, societal, and cyber security risks.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of pollutants into the environment. We believe that we conduct our operations in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Certain of our current and formerly owned and/or leased properties are known or suspected to have been used by prior owners or operators as retail gas stations and a few of these properties may have been used for other environmentally sensitive purposes. Certain of these properties previously contained underground storage tanks (“USTs”) and some of these properties may currently contain abandoned USTs. It is possible that petroleum products and other contaminants may have been released at these properties into the soil or groundwater. 
4

Under applicable federal and state environmental laws, we, as the current or former owner or operator of these sites, may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigation and remediation of any such contamination, as well as any other environmental conditions at our properties that are unrelated to USTs. We have obtained insurance coverage that we believe is reasonable to manage any potential risks related to environmental remediation liabilities.
