DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report, unless the context requires otherwise, references to the “Company,” “Avalanche,” “we,” “our company” and “us” refer to Avalanche International, Corp., a Nevada corporation, together with its subsidiaries.
Company Overview and Description of Business
 
Avalanche is a holding company currently engaged in acquiring and/or developing businesses in which the Company maintains a controlling interest. The Company anticipates that its subsidiaries will be engaged in a number of diverse business activities. The Company currently has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Smith and Ramsay Brands, LLC (“SRB”) and Restaurant Capital Group, LLC (“RCG”). SRB was formed on May 19, 2014, and RCG was formed on October 22, 2015. SRB was originally formed as a manufacturer and distributor of flavored liquids for electronic vaporizers and eCigarettes and accessories; this business was discontinued in June 2015. RCG was formed to hold the Company’s investments in the restaurant industry. In March 2017, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a third business, MTIX Ltd., an advanced materials and processing technology company located in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, UK (“MTIX”). MTIX has developed a novel cost effective and environmentally friendly material synthesis technology for textile applications that uses a combination of plasma and photonic energy to effect material synthesis of a substrate surface. See the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a more detailed discussion of the definitive agreement to acquire MTIX
 
The Company is engaged in a variety of activities which we believe will expand the number and type of businesses in which we invest and ultimately have a controlling interest. The Company identifies investment opportunities through an extensive network of contacts with investment banking and venture capital firms and other associations with high net-worth individuals and individuals at universities such as the University of South Florida and the Byrd Institute. Upon identification of an investment opportunity the Company relies upon the executive management team to conduct a thorough evaluation of the target and its technology. As required, the executive management team may consult with individuals that have specialized expertise in the target industry. In the case of an investment where the executive management team is satisfied with its evaluation, the basic terms of an investment are negotiated directly by the executive management team and, depending on the amount of the transaction, presented to the Board for approval. Upon mutual acceptance of the basic terms, outside counsel would prepare the transaction investment documents.
 
Avalanche’s operating businesses are managed on a centralized basis. The Company’s senior management participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the key executive officers to head each of the operating businesses. Our capital allocation decisions are based on extensive analysis of potential subsidiary companies' business operations supported by an in-depth understanding of the quality of their revenues and cash flow potential, variability of costs and the inherent value of their assets, including proprietary intangible assets and intellectual property.
 
Restaurant Capital Group, LLC
 
On April 13, 2016, RCG entered into an agreement to finance a new restaurant owned by Philo Group, LLC (“Philo”). The restaurant is named Giulia, and will feature Italian fusion cuisine and two stylish full service bars with an intimate lounge atmosphere. Giulia, which opened in March 2017, is located near the Financial District, LA Live, and the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles. Philo has placed a significant emphasis on the distinctive, contemporary interior design and decor of Giulia. We believe that this stylish restaurant design and decor will contribute to the distinctive dining experience enjoyed by customers and generate higher annual sales per square foot that than is typical in our industry.
 
Our initial investment in Philo was structured as a loan and between April 2016 and April 2017, we provided $931,000 in financing to Philo under the terms of Senior Secured Property Note dated April 4, 2016, as amended (the “Philo Note”). The Philo Note bears interest at a rate of sixteen percent (16%) per year and is personally guaranteed by the principal of Philo, and secured by all assets of Philo. In addition, we expect to renegotiate the terms of our investment in Philo such that we obtain a significant ownership in Giulia.

Competitive Positioning
 
The restaurant business is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, access to qualified operations personnel, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and location. Restaurants in which we invest will compete with national and regional restaurant dining chains, independently-owned restaurants, quick-service restaurants, mobile catering and grocery stores that offer variety and high quality prepared food products. We look for investments in restaurants that will focus on differentiating their operations on key strengths, which may include the following:

· | Extensive and innovative menu;
--+-------------------------------


· | High quality and high profile restaurant location;
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | Distinctive restaurant design and ambience;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | Mainstream appeal of menu selections;
--+--------------------------------------


· | Distinctive upscale casual dining experience;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | Significant bar and happy hour business;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | Personalized customer service.
--+-------------------------------

Government Regulation
 
The restaurant industry is governed by numerous federal, state and local laws affecting the conduct of operations. Restaurants are subject to licensing and regulation by a number of government authorities, including alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, labor, zoning and public safety agencies and to periodic review by state and municipal authorities for areas in which the restaurant is located. The restaurant industry is also subject to numerous environmental regulations, including water usage and sanitation disposal. Denials, revocation or temporary suspension of necessary licenses or approvals could have a material adverse impact on the restaurant.
 
In order to serve alcoholic beverages, a restaurant must comply with alcoholic beverage control regulations which require each restaurant to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities, for a license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be subject to penalties, temporary suspension or revocation for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations impact many aspects of the daily operations of a restaurant, including the minimum ages of patrons and employees, hours of operation, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. In many jurisdictions, state and local authorities routinely monitor compliance with alcoholic beverage laws. If a restaurant that we invest in were to encounter any material problems relating to alcoholic beverage licenses or permits it would adversely affect that restaurant’s operations and profitability.
 
The restaurants that we expect to invest in will almost all serve alcoholic beverages. Most states have adopted “dram shop” statutes. Those statutes generally provide a person who has been injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to such person. Despite the requirement that a restaurant in which we invest must carry liquor liability coverage as a component of its general liability insurance, a judgment against the restaurant under a “dram shop” statute in excess of the liability coverage could have a material adverse effect on that restaurant’s operations.
 
Restaurant operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship requirements, and overtime. Several states have set minimum wage rates higher than the current federal level. Hourly personnel at restaurants are paid at rates related to state and federal minimum wage laws and, accordingly, state minimum wage increases that will be implemented during the next several years will increase labor costs. Increases in the minimum wage rate or the cost of workers’ compensation insurance, changes in tip-credit provisions, employee benefit costs or other costs associated with employees could adversely affect a restaurant’s operating results.
 
Restaurant’s must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”) and related federal and state statutes which prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to public accommodations and employment.
 
We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, financial information and health information. Accordingly, operators of restaurants must continually update information technology systems and staff member training in order to comply with these laws.

Restaurant Operations
 
An upscale restaurant must consistently and properly execute a complex menu offering items prepared daily with high quality, fresh ingredients in a high-volume environment. Thus, the success of those restaurants in which we invest will be largely dependent upon selecting and retaining dedicated General Managers, other management employees and hourly staff members. If the restaurant in which we invest are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified restaurant management and operating personnel in a very competitive landscape, our restaurants may be unable to effectively operate and grow business and revenues, which could ultimately materially adversely affect our financial performance.
 
We believe that the popularity of the restaurants in which we will invest will allow us to attract and retain high quality, experienced restaurant-level management and other operational personnel. We believe that features that will initially drive the popularity of a restaurant will likely be the location and the distinctive restaurant design and ambience, key factors in our competitive positioning. We envision that highly experienced general managers will be responsible for selecting and training hourly staff members for their respective restaurants. Enthusiasm and commitment in the restaurant’s staff members will be achieved through daily staff meetings and dedicated training. 
 
Marketing and Advertising
 
We expect that the restaurants in which we invest will rely on their high-profile locations, media interest and positive word of mouth, to retain and grow market share. We will also attempt to build awareness and relationships with retailers located in the same developments, shopping center operators, local hotel concierges and others in the community. At times, we may also engage in marketing and advertising opportunities in selective local markets.
Food Safety and Quality Assurance
 
The general managers of restaurants in which we invest will initially oversee food safety, nutritional and regulatory compliance to ensure that safe, high quality foods are produced in a clean and safe environment. Our food safety standards are geared to the prevention of contamination and illness and executing to all regulatory requirements as well as industry standards. The selection of any supplier will be conditioned on that supplier’s ability to demonstrate strict adherence to sanitation, good manufacturing and agricultural practices, product protection and food security. In addition, all food suppliers must have annual food safety and quality system audits.
Competition
 
The restaurant industry is highly fragmented and intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and location. Actual and potential competitors include national and regional restaurant dining chains, independently-owned restaurants, quick-service restaurants, mobile catering and grocery stores that offer variety and high quality prepared food products. Many of our potential competitors have considerably greater financial resources, higher revenue, and greater economies of scale. It is anticipated that competition will continue to increase due to these factors. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns; national and regional employment statistics; the cost and availability of raw materials, labor, and energy; purchasing power; governmental regulations; and local competitive factors. Any change in these or other related factors or negative publicity relating to food safety could adversely affect our restaurant operations. We believe that we will compete favorably with respect to each of these factors.
 
Smith and Ramsay Brands, LLC
 
The Company established SRB as a manufacturer and distributor of flavored liquids for electronic vaporizers and eCigarettes and accessories (the “Vape Business”). SRB had intended to aggressively expand the Vape business with additional flavors in its signature brand and by expanding through additional new brands and the acquisition and distribution of signature and non-signature accessories. In mid-Fall of 2014, SRB began a targeted rollout of its Vape Business and during June 2015 we made the decision to discontinue operations in the Vape Business. The decision to discontinue this line of business was based upon the highly competitive marketplace and exceedingly small gross margins that we were realizing in the Vape Business combined with other business opportunities, such as the restaurant business, where we expect to generate much greater returns.

Technology and Intellectual Property
 
Trademarks
 
We believe that having distinguishing marks for products that we may develop will be an important marketing characteristic. Currently, we do not have any U.S. registered trademarks on the principal register at the USPTO. We have not sought any foreign trademark protection at this time. U.S. trademark registrations generally are for fixed, but renewable, terms.

Employees
 
As of April 27, 2017, we employed two permanent management level personnel and work with outside labor and consultants to complete the tasks at hand. We may require additional employees in the future. There is intense competition for capable, experienced personnel and there is no assurance the Company will be able to obtain new qualified employees when required. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement and our management considers relations with employees to be good.
