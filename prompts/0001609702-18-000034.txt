Item 1. Business
This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements based on management’s expectations and assumptions as of the date of this filing. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of Part I–“Risk Factors.”
CDK Global, Inc. is the former Dealer Services division of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (“ADP”). We were incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ADP on September 29, 2014 and began operating as an independent public company on September 30, 2014. Our principal corporate offices are located in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “CDK.”
As used herein, “CDK Global,” “CDK,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and similar terms include CDK Global, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.
Overview
Our purpose is to enable end-to-end automotive commerce across the globe. For over 40 years, CDK Global has served automotive retailers and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") by providing innovative solutions that allow them to better connect, manage, analyze, and grow their businesses. Our solutions automate and integrate all parts of the buying process, including the advertising, acquisition, sale, financing, insuring, parts supply, repair, and maintenance of vehicles, in more than 100 countries around the world, for approximately 28,000 retail locations and most OEMs.
We have organized our operations into two main operating groups, CDK North America and CDK International. CDK North America comprises two reportable operating segments, Retail Solutions North America (“RSNA”) and Advertising North America (“ANA”). CDK International (“CDKI”) is also a reportable operating segment. Additional information on our reportable segments and geographic areas is contained in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 18 - Financial Data by Segment.”
Our Strategy
To enable end-to-end automotive commerce, our strategy is to invest for the long-term in integrated software products and an open technology platform that can deliver seamless, workflow-driven solutions for our customers. The automotive retail market is evolving and demand for new and integrated technology solutions is growing: consumers increasingly expect a seamless omnichannel experience when purchasing or servicing vehicles; OEMs see technology as a tool to ensure a consistent and positive customer experience across their retail networks; and retailers are seeking integrated workflow technology solutions to help them improve both customer satisfaction and dealership cost structure. We believe that the best way to compete in a world with numerous providers of unconnected software solutions for numerous automotive retailers, OEMs, consumers, and vehicles is to provide integrated technology solutions and platform tools that can connect the disparate elements to create continuous retail workflows.
Our Business
We generate revenue primarily by providing a broad suite of subscription-based software and technology solutions for automotive retailers through our RSNA and CDKI segments. We are focused on the use of software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) and mobile-centric solutions that are highly functional, flexible, and fast. Our flagship Dealer Management System (“DMS”) software solutions are hosted enterprise resource planning applications tailored to the unique requirements of the retail automotive industry. Our DMS products facilitate the sale of new and used vehicles, consumer financing, repair and maintenance services, and vehicle and parts inventory management. Additionally, these solutions enable company-wide accounting, financial reporting, cash flow management, and payroll services. Our DMSs are typically integrated with OEM data processing systems that enable automotive retailers to order vehicles and parts, receive vehicle records, process warranties, and check recall campaigns and service bulletins while helping them to fulfill their franchisee responsibilities to their OEM franchisors.
Complimentary to our core DMSs in the RSNA segment, we also provide a portfolio of layered software applications and services to address the unique needs of automotive retail workflows. These solutions are often tightly integrated to and targeted at users of our DMSs, but may, in some cases, be provided to customers that do not otherwise use our DMS. Our principal layered applications are:

Solutions | Description 
Vehicle Sales Solutions | Technology tools and services to streamline the entire vehicle inventory, sales, and finance and insurance (“F&I”) process 
Fixed Operations Solutions | Solutions to manage the parts and service profit center of dealerships, including customer targeting, appointment scheduling, on-site workflow, and billing
Customer Relationship Management Solutions | Software to manage interactions with current and prospective customers 
Financial Management Solutions | Value-added capabilities for accounts payable, payments, and payroll 
Document Management Solutions | Document creation and archiving solutions to address the complex automotive retail sales process 
Network Management Solutions | Wired and wireless network solutions to support dealer connectivity and security efforts 
Integrated Telephony Management Solutions | Integrated telephony solutions that allow automotive retailers to connect and communicate via presence, instant messaging, voice, and video 
Websites | Proprietary internet content delivery platform for providing compelling, dynamic websites for auto retailers 

In the RSNA segment, we further connect the automotive ecosystem by providing third party retail solution providers with robust and secure interfaces to the core DMS through our Partner Program. For both automotive retailers and OEMs we provided data management and business intelligence solutions that extract, cleanse, normalize, enhance, and distribute data and to provide actionable insights. 
In both our RSNA and CDKI segments, we offer automotive retailers and OEMs a variety of professional services, custom programming, consulting, implementation and training solutions, as well as a full range of customer support solutions.
In addition to providing solutions to automotive retailers and OEMs, our RSNA segment also provides solutions to retailers and manufacturers of heavy trucks, construction equipment, agricultural equipment, motorcycles, boats, and other marine and recreational vehicles.
Through our ANA segment, we provide advertising solutions, including management of digital advertising spend, for primarily North American automotive retailers, automotive retailer associations, and OEMs. These solutions provide a coordinated offering across multiple marketing channels to help achieve customer marketing and sales objectives and coordinate execution between OEMs and their retailer networks. Primarily driven by revenue generated through our ANA and RSNA segments, our largest customer is General Motors. We generated approximately 9% of our consolidated revenues from a combination of General Motors and General Motors automotive retailers during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 ("fiscal 2018").
Product Development and Innovation
Our ability to strengthen and extend our solutions portfolio is a key element of our business strategy. We execute on this strategy through a combination of development and the selective pursuit of strategic acquisitions. In our fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, June 30, 2017 ("fiscal 2017"), and June 30, 2016 ("fiscal 2016"), we spent $131.3 million, $150.0 million, and $161.0 million, respectively, to research, develop, and deploy new and enhanced solutions for our customers. Additionally, we had cash flows used for qualifying capitalized software development cost of $41.1 million, $31.8 million, and $13.5 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
In addition to the ongoing investment to enhance existing solutions within our core business, we also invest in long- and medium-term product innovation aligned with our strategy. For example, the Fortellis Automotive Commerce Exchange under development is expected to be the foundation of our open technology platform for automotive commerce. Within the automotive commerce market, Fortellis will allow CDK Global and third parties to develop adaptive and interchangeable application programming interfaces ("APIs") that can be used to connect existing technology solutions and build new solutions quickly and with high levels of reliability. Similarly, we are developing Drive Flex DMS, a cloud-based DMS designed for smaller dealerships that will introduce an innovative, adaptive commercial model in addition to new technology. We are developing these solutions using a methodical and measured approach with respect to capital and resource allocation. We believe these investments align to our strategy and will position CDK Global to take advantage of the evolving automotive retail market. 
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with a broad and diverse range of information, technology, services, and consulting companies, as well as with the in-house capabilities of OEMs. Our competitors range from local providers to regional and global competitors. However, we believe that no competitor provides the same combination of geographical reach and breadth of solutions that we do.
Each of our solutions faces competition from an array of solution providers. For our DMS solutions in North America, our principal competitors are Reynolds and Reynolds, Dealertrack (Cox Automotive), Auto/Mate, AutoSoft, PBS Systems, and various local and regional providers. For our CDKI segment, DMS competition is principally from local and regional providers. The most significant competitive factors that we face across our solutions are price, breadth of features and functionality, user experience, quality, brand, scalability, and service capability.
Regulation 
The automotive retail industry is highly regulated and automotive retailers and OEMs are subject to a broad array of complex regulations governing virtually every aspect of their operations. Our customers must ensure their compliance with their regulatory requirements, and, in turn, we must ensure that our solutions effectively address their regulatory compliance needs.
Because our business delivers solutions across a broad spectrum of automotive retailer operations, our activities are impacted by a wide variety of federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations. Central to the value of our Document Management Solutions, for example, is that the forms we provide for our customers meet the requirements of their applicable laws. Likewise, within our Vehicle Sales Solutions, our electronic vehicle registration service is dependent on our compliance with complex and detailed regulatory requirements. Across our portfolio of automotive retail solutions, we are focused on ensuring that we meet our regulatory compliance obligations and that our solutions enable our customers to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to them. See “Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business" for additional information regarding the application and impact of laws and regulations on our operations.
Privacy and Data Protection Regulations
We are subject to a number of federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations regarding data governance and the privacy and protection of personal data. For example, under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the “GLB Act”), automotive retailers are generally deemed to be regulated financial institutions and therefore are subject to the GLB Act and applicable regulations, including the Federal Trade Commission's ("FTC") Privacy Rule and Safeguards Rule. In our capacity as a service provider to automotive retailers, we generally commit to our customers that we will handle non-public personal information consistent with the GLB Act and the related regulations. Similarly, many United States ("U.S.") states and foreign jurisdictions have adopted regulations that impose obligations on businesses that handle personal information, including notification requirements in the event of data breaches relating to personal data, as well as minimum security standards with respect to the handling and transmission of personal data. For a discussion of privacy and data protection regulation and the potential impacts on our business, see “Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business.”
Seasonality in Our Business
Though our business is not highly cyclical, it is seasonal. Our revenues experience volatility around seasonal consumer vehicle shopping activity. We address this seasonality in sales by establishing annual quotas for each of our sales professionals. While this volatility is experienced throughout the industry, it is amplified in our advertising business where advertising spend may vary significantly throughout the year given the increasing importance to OEMs and automotive retailers of capturing buyer attention during certain seasonal periods and major events such as the launch of a new vehicle model.
Employees 
As of June 30, 2018, we had a total of approximately 8,500 full-time employees worldwide. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We have work councils and statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries outside the United States. We believe that relations with our employees are good.
