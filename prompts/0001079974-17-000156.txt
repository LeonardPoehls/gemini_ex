 Principal services and their markets
 
Our Company's primary service is lead generation for its customers.  The Company's target customers are currently companies in the insurance and financial service industries, but we intend to expand to additional industries in the future.  Below, our lead generation service and process are detailed in an effort to explain the methods by which our company generates revenue.
 
LEAD GENERATION DEFINITION: A lead, in a marketing context, is a potential sales contact: an individual or organization that expresses an interest in your goods or services. Leads are typically obtained through the referral of an existing customer, or through a direct response to advertising/publicity.  A company's marketing department is typically responsible for lead generation. Pursuing and closing leads normally falls to the company's sales department. For example, a vendor will display their wares at an industry trade show, hoping to attract the attention of qualified buyers attending the exhibit. Each inquiry for more vendor information would be a "lead," which might subsequently be developed into a sale. A company's lead generation efforts and its approach to dealing with leads can significantly impact its success in the marketplace.  We use two separate methods of acquiring leads, which are online generation and offline generation.

Online generation
 There are many ways to generate leads online. Each has its own formula that needs to be perfected in order to find the balance between quantity and quality. The online lead generation methods used by our Company are as follows, with each including a description of how the process involved with each type of lead generation method is utilized.
 1. Proprietary Lead Portals : provides several ways for advertisers to put targeted offers in front of a buying consumer audience via a proprietary network of websites all specifically built for a broad or specific industry. For this service, our customers pay per generated lead on a cost per lead (the delivery of just the name and contact details) or cost per acquisition basis (an actual credit card paid transaction.)
 
2. Search engine optimization (SEO): is the process of improving the volume or quality of traffic to a website from search engines via "natural" or un-paid ("organic" or "algorithmic") search results as opposed to search engine marketing (SEM) which deals with paid inclusion. Typically, the earlier (or higher) a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine.  SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, local search, video search, and industry-specific vertical search engines. This gives a web site web presence.  As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work and what people search for.  Optimizing a website primarily involves editing its content and HTML and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines.
 
The acronym "SEO" can refer to "search engine optimizers," a term adopted by an industry of consultants who carry out optimization projects on behalf of clients, and by employees who perform SEO services in-house.  Search engine optimizers may offer SEO as a stand-alone service or as a part of a broader marketing campaign. Because effective SEO may require changes to the HTML source code of a site, SEO tactics may be incorporated into web site development and design. The term "search engine friendly" may be used to describe web site designs, menus, content management systems, images, videos, shopping carts, and other elements that have been optimized for the purpose of search engine exposure.  Another class of techniques, known as black hat SEO or spamdexing, use methods such as link farms, keyword stuffing and article spinning that degrade both the relevance of search results and the user experience of search engines. Search engines look for sites that employ these techniques in order to remove them from their indices.
 
3. Pay Per Click: is an Internet advertising model used on websites, in which advertisers pay a host only when their ad is clicked. With search engines, advertisers typically bid on keyword phrases relevant to their target market. Content sites commonly charge a fixed price per click rather than use a bidding system.
 
Cost per click (CPC) is the amount of money an advertiser pays search engines and other Internet publishers for a single click on its advertisement that brings one visitor to its website.  In contrast to the generalized portal, this seeks to drive a high volume of traffic to one site. It does this by offering financial incentives (in the form of a percentage of revenue) to affiliated partner sites.
 
4. Email Advertising: is a form of direct marketing which uses electronic mail as a means of communicating commercial or fundraising messages to an audience. In its broadest sense, every e-mail sent to one of our customer's potential or current client could be considered e-mail marketing. However, the term is usually used to refer to:
 
• sending e-mails with the purpose of enhancing the relationship of a merchant with its current or previous customers and to encourage customer loyalty and repeat business,
 
• sending e-mails with the purpose of acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to
 purchase something immediately,
 
• adding advertisements to e-mails sent by other companies to their customers, and
 
5. Online Internet Publishers: are companies specializing in lead generation and buy email, search, and banner traffic to drive potential leads to proprietary portals that they own. Using ads promoting information about products and services, potential leads arrive at these portals at which time they are required to fill out their full contact information. The prospects then choose freely what advertisements they are interested in by opting into or filling out a custom form of each offer they want more information about. Since each lead opts in, the Internet publishers capture the IP ("Internet Protocol") address of the computer each lead comes from, as well as the date and time of capture.
 
6. Website Banner Advertisements: A web banner or banner ad is a form of advertising on the World Wide Web. This form of online advertising entails embedding an advertisement into a web page. It is intended to attract traffic to a website by linking to the website of the advertiser. The advertisement is constructed from an image,, JavaScript program or multimedia object employing technologies such as Java, Shockwave or Flash, often employing animation, sound, or video to maximize presence.

The web banner is displayed when a web page that references the banner is loaded into a web browser.
 
This event is known as an "impression". When the viewer clicks on the banner, the viewer is directed to the website advertised in the banner. This event is known as a "click through". In many cases, banners are delivered by a central ad server.  When the advertiser scans their log files and detects that a web user has visited the advertiser's site from the content site by clicking on the banner ad, the advertiser sends the content provider some small amount of money. This payback system is often how the content provider is able to pay for the Internet access to supply the content in the first place. Usually though, advertisers use ad networks to serve their advertisements, resulting in a revenue sharing system and higher quality ad placement.  Web banners function the same way as traditional advertisements are intended to function: notifying consumers of the product or service and presenting reasons why the consumer should choose the product in question, although web banners differ in that the results for advertisement campaigns may be monitored real-time and may be targeted to the viewer's interests.
 
7. Blogs: A weblog, web log or simply a blog, is a web application which contains periodic time-stamped posts on a common webpage. These posts are often but not necessarily in reverse chronological order.  Such a website would typically be accessible to any Internet user. "Weblog" is a portmanteau of "web" and "log". The term "blog" came into common use as a way of avoiding confusion with the term server log.
 
8. Social Networking: is a term that describes use of social networks, online communities, blogs, wikis or any other online collaborative media for marketing, sales, public relations and customer service.
 
Common social media marketing tools include Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Flickr, Wikipedia, Orkut and YouTube.
 
In the context of internet marketing, social media refers to a collective group of web properties whose content is primarily published by users, not direct employees of the property (e.g., the vast majority of video on YouTube is published by non-YouTube employees).
 
9. Affiliate Network: is an Internet-based marketing practice in which a business rewards one or more affiliates for each visitor or customer brought about by the affiliate's marketing efforts. It is an application of crowdsourcing. Examples include rewards sites, where users are rewarded with cash or gifts, for the completion of an offer, and the referral of others to the site.
 
The affiliate marketing industry has four core players: the merchant (also known as 'retailer' or 'brand'), the network, the publisher (also known as 'the affiliate') and the customer. The market has grown in complexity to warrant a secondary tier of players, including affiliate management agencies, superaffiliates and specialized third parties vendors.
 
Affiliate marketing overlaps with other Internet marketing methods to some degree, because affiliates often use regular advertising methods. Those methods include organic search engine optimization, paid search engine marketing, e-mail marketing, and in some sense display advertising. On the other hand, affiliates sometimes use less orthodox techniques, such as publishing reviews of products or services offered by a partner.
 
10. Affiliate Programs: using one website to drive traffic to another—is a form of online marketing, which is frequently overlooked by advertisers. While search engines, e-mail, and website syndication capture much of the attention of online retailers, affiliate marketing carries a much lower profile. Still, affiliates continue to play a significant role in e-retailers' marketing strategies.
Offline Lead Generation
 Live Phone Lead Transfer Division
 Using a combination of a predictive dialer call center solution and an overseas outsourced call center solution, our Company is able to generate custom live transfer leads for our customers.  We utilize this method of lead generation in situations where we are confident that a high volume of live leads can be generated and sold for a profit. It is possible to charge high prices for leads generated by using this method, and it also allows our customers to meet profitability goals and acquisition costs goals. Competitive pricing will be determined from the ability to generate a certain volume of leads/day for each of our customers. The necessity to increase or decrease our use of this method of lead generation for our customers will be determined each day based on the amount of leads generated.
 Revenue Model and Distribution methods of the products or services   Our revenue model is based on customer development.  We either purchase leads from accredited brokers or locate leads based on the methods described above, and then resell those leads to our customers through our automated system.  The leads must meet the stringent criteria of our system.  The leads are vetted through our fraud filters in order to ensure quality.
