 Implications of being an Emerging Growth Company 
 Since our initial public offering (“IPO”), we have continued to qualify as an “emerging growth company” (“EGC”) as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). An EGC may take advantage of specified reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. 
 As an EGC: 
  
• | We are exempt from the requirement to obtain an attestation and report from our independent registered public accounting firm on the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are permitted to provide less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are not required to give our stockholders non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have elected to use an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of these reduced burdens. We will continue to operate under these provisions until December 31, 2018, or such earlier time that we are no longer an EGC. We would cease to be an EGC if we have 
 1


more than $1.07 billion in annual revenues, qualify as a “large accelerated filer” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which requires us to have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.

 Our Business 
 We are a global provider of 3D printing machines and 3D printed and other products, materials and services to industrial customers. Our business primarily consists of manufacturing and selling 3D printing machines and printing products to specification for our customers using our installed base of 3D printing machines. Our machines serve direct and indirect applications.  Direct printing produces a component; indirect printing makes a tool to produce a component. We offer pre-production collaboration and print products for customers through our network of PSCs and EACs. We also supply the associated materials, including consumables and replacement parts, and other services, including training and technical support that is necessary for purchasers of our 3D printing machines to print products. We believe that our ability to print in a variety of industrial materials, as well as our industry-leading volumetric output (as measured by build box size and printing speed), uniquely position us to serve the needs of industrial customers. 
 Our History 
 Our business began as the advanced manufacturing business of the Extrude Hone Corporation, which manufactured its first 3D printing machine in 2003 using licensed technology developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”). In 2005, our business assets were transferred to The Ex One Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, when Extrude Hone Corporation was purchased by another company. In 2007, we were acquired by S. Kent Rockwell through his wholly-owned company, Rockwell Forest Products, Inc. On January 1, 2013, the Company was formed, when The Ex One Company, LLC was merged with and into a newly created Delaware corporation, which changed its name to The ExOne Company. On February 12, 2013, we completed our IPO, raising approximately $90.4 million in unrestricted net proceeds after underwriting commissions and offering costs. Subsequent secondary offerings of our common stock have resulted in raising approximately $78.0 million in additional unrestricted net proceeds after underwriting commissions and offering costs.
The Additive Manufacturing Industry and 3D Printing 
 3D printing is the most common type of an emerging manufacturing technology that is broadly referred to as additive manufacturing (“AM”). In general, AM is a term used to describe a manufacturing process that produces 3D objects directly from digital or computer models through the repeated deposit of very thin layers of material. 3D printing is the process of joining materials from a digital 3D model, usually layer by layer, to make objects using a printhead, nozzle, or other printing technology. The terms “AM” and “3D printing” are increasingly being used interchangeably, as the media and marketplace have popularized the term 3D printing rather than AM, which is the industry term. 
 AM represents a transformational shift from traditional forms of manufacturing (e.g., machining or tooling), which are sometimes referred to as subtractive manufacturing. We believe that AM and 3D printing are increasingly poised to displace traditional manufacturing methodologies in a growing range of industrial applications. Our 3D printing process differs from other forms of 3D printing processes, in that we use a chemical binding agent and focus on industrial applications. 
 AM has focused on prototyping and small, limited production in order to find acceptance of its varying technologies by end users in order to convince users of traditional methods of the viability of such new applications. As AM has evolved, the focus has evolved 
 2


into production readiness and increasing reliability and repeatability standards associated with higher volumetric output and specifications that industrial applications demand.
 ExOne and 3D Printing  
 We provide 3D printed and other products, materials and services primarily to industrial customers and other end-market users. We believe that we are an early entrant into the AM industrial products market and are one of the few providers of 3D printing solutions to industrial customers. 
 Our binder jetting technology was developed over 15 years ago by researchers at MIT. Our 3D printing machines build or print products from computer-aided drafting (“CAD”) models by depositing successive thin layers of particles of materials such as silicate sand or metal powder in a “build box.” A moveable printhead passes over each layer and deposits a chemical binding agent in the selected areas where the finished product will be materialized. Each layer can be unique. 
 Depending on the industrial material used in printing, printed products may need post-production processing. We generally use silica sand or foundry sand for casting, both of which typically require no additional processing. Products printed in other materials, such as metals, or for use in specific applications, may need varying amounts of heat treating or sintering, drying or curing, or other post-processing or finishing.
 Pre-Print. We believe that our customers have the opportunity to take greater advantage of the design freedom that our 3D printing technology provides. We collaborate with our customers to develop and refine CAD designs that meet our customers’ specifications and can be read and processed by our 3D printing machines. We continue to invest in additional pre-print capabilities and resources that empower our customers to fully exploit the design freedom of 3D printing. 
 Industrial Materials. We supply printing materials to our customers that have been qualified for use with our machines. As we experience increased demand for our products globally, it is essential that the material supply chain and distribution channels be in close proximity to our current and prospective customers. For the highest quality printed products, the sand grains and metal particles used in the 3D printing process must be uniform in size and meet very specific tolerances. We continue to focus on material development activities associated with our 3D printing process, including collaborative arrangements with customers targeted at local supply resources. In addition, we have specifically targeted fine powder printing with respect to our direct printing technologies as one of our strategic priorities as an organization.
 Our Machines. Our 3D printing machines consist of a build box that includes a machine platform and a computer processor controlling the printheads for applying layers of industrial materials and binding agents. We currently build our 3D printing machines in both Germany and the United States. Our machines serve direct and indirect applications.  Direct printing produces a component; indirect printing makes a tool to produce a component. Our focus is on enhancing our existing machine technologies and developing large format printers for both direct and indirect applications, with specific emphasis on fine powder printing for our direct technologies.
 Our 3D printing machines are used primarily to manufacture industrial products that are ordered in relatively low volumes, are highly complex and have a high value to the customer. Our technology is not appropriate for the mass production of simple parts, such as certain higher volume injection molded parts or certain higher volume parts made in metal stamping machines. Traditional manufacturing technology is more economical in making those parts. While we expect over time to be able to increase the kinds of parts that we can make more economically than using subtractive manufacturing, we do not ever expect to use our technology to make simple, low-cost, mass-produced parts. 
 Post-Print Processing. After a product is printed, the bound and unbound powder in the build box requires curing of the chemical binding agent. For indirect printing of sand molds and cores, curing may occur at room temperature and the printed product is complete after the binder is cured. For certain binder types, a drying process (utilizing an industrial microwave or other means) may be necessary. The mold or core is then poured at a foundry, yielding the finished metal product. We believe that our casting technology offers a number of advantages over traditional casting methods, including increased yield, weight reduction and improved thermal range. 
 For direct printing the product needs to be either sintered, or sintered and infiltrated. With sintering, the product is placed into a furnace in an inert atmosphere to sinter the bonded particles and form a strong bonded porous structure. The porous structure can be further infiltrated with another material to fill the voids. After the sintering and infiltration, the product can be polished and finished with a variety of standard industrial methods and coatings. We believe that our 3D printing capabilities enable customers to develop the ideal design for products, freeing them of some of the design constraints inherent in traditional manufacturing, in the industrial metal of choice and in a more efficient manner than traditional manufacturing methods. 
 Customers and Sales 
 Our Customers
 Our customers are located primarily in North America, Europe and Asia. We are a party to non-disclosure agreements with many of our customers and, therefore, are often prohibited from disclosing many of our customers’ identities. Our customers include a number of Fortune 500 companies that are leaders in their respective markets, as well as mid-cap and smaller public and private 
 3


companies. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we conducted a significant portion of our business with a limited number of customers, though not necessarily the same customers for each respective period. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, our five most significant customers represented approximately 20.5%, 17.1% and 19.0% of total revenue, respectively. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, there were no customers that individually represented 10.0% or greater of our total revenue. Sales of 3D printing machines are low volume, but generate significant revenue based on their per-unit pricing. Generally, sales of 3D printing machines are to different customers in each respective period, with the timing of such sales dependent on the customer’s capital budgeting cycle, which may vary from period to period. The nature of our revenue from 3D printing machines does not leave us dependent upon a single or a limited number of customers. Sales of 3D printed and other products, materials and services generally result in a significantly lower aggregate price per order as compared to 3D printing machine sales. The nature of the revenue from 3D printed and other products, materials and services does not leave us dependent upon a single or a limited number of customers.
 Educating Our Customers
 Educating our customers and raising awareness in our target markets about the many uses and benefits of our 3D printing technology is an important part of our sales process. We believe that customers who experience the efficiency gains, decreased lead-time, increased design flexibility, and decreased cost potential of 3D printing, as compared to subtractive manufacturing, are more likely to purchase our 3D printing machines and be repeat customers of our products and services. We educate our customers on the design freedom, speed, and other benefits of 3D printing by providing printing and design services and support through our PSCs and EACs. We also seek to expose key potential users to our products through our PSCs and EACs, installed machines at customers’ locations, university programs, and sales and marketing efforts. Additionally, our EACs provide a greater variety of our latest binder and material sets, including cold hardening phenolic and sodium silicate production, as well as an expanded range of our machine platforms and machine options. 
Production Service Centers and ExOne Adoption Centers 
 We have established a network of PSCs and EACs in North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania; Troy, Michigan; Houston, Texas; Gersthofen, Germany; Desenzano del Garda, Italy; and Kanagawa, Japan. Our three centers located in the United States were certified to ISO 9001:2008 as Industrial Additive Manufacturers. Through our PSCs and EACs, we provide sales and marketing and delivery of support and printing services to our customers. Our customers see our 3D printing machines in operation and can evaluate their production capabilities before ordering a 3D printing machine or a printed product or service. While our centers are scalable and have a well-defined footprint that can be easily replicated to serve additional regional markets, we are focusing on enhancing our existing centers to enable adoption rather than geographic expansion. As described below, enhancing our positon in strategic locations around the world is an important part of our business strategy. 
 For all customers, we offer the following support and services through our PSCs and EACs: 
  
• | Pre-production Collaboration. Our pre-print services include data capture using software that enables customers to translate their product vision into a digital design format that can be used as an input to our 3D printing equipment. We help our customers successfully move from the design stage to the production stage, and help customers evaluate the optimal design and industrial materials for their production needs. For example, we worked with a customer to design and manufacture parts that eliminated significant weight from a helicopter, which was possible because of the flexibility and precision of our AM process. Our 3D printing machines are also able to deliver a replacement for a product broken by the customer rapidly or often immediately because we will already have the production computer file. Using subtractive manufacturing would take significantly longer.

• | Consumable Materials. We provide customers with the inputs used in our 3D printing machines, including tools, printing materials, and bonding agents. Our EACs provide a greater variety of our latest binder and material sets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Training and Technical Support. Our technicians train customers to use our 3D printing machines through hands-on experience at our PSC and EACs and provide field support to our customers, including design assistance, education on industrial materials, operations and printing training, instruction on cleaning, and maintenance and troubleshooting.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Aftermarket. We generally offer a standard warranty with the sale of a 3D printing machine to a customer. Thereafter, we offer a variety of service and support plans.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe that our competitive strengths include: 
  
• | Volumetric Output Rate. We believe that our 3D printing machines provide us the highest rate of volume output per unit of time among competing AM technologies. Because of our early entrance into the industrial market for AM and our investment in our core 3D printing technology, we have been able to improve the printhead speed and build box size of our 3D printing machines. As a result, we have made strides in improving the output efficiency of our 3D printing machines, as measured by volume output per unit of time. With continued advances in our core 3D printing technologies, we believe that our cost of production will continue to decline, increasing our ability to compete with subtractive manufacturing processes, particularly for complex products, effectively expanding our addressable market.

• | Printing Platform Size. The size of the build box area and the platform upon which we construct a product is important to industrial customers who may want to either make a high number of products per job run or make an industrial product that has large dimensions and is heavy in final form. We believe that our technology and experience give us the potential to develop large build platforms to meet the production demands of current and potential industrial customers. In addition, we have created machine platforms in various size ranges in order to cater to the varying demands of our customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Industrial Materials. Our indirect 3D printing machines are able to manufacture sand molds and cores from specialty sands and ceramics, which are the traditional materials for these casting products. Our direct 3D printing machines are capable of printing in industrial metals and other materials, including stainless steel, bronze, iron, bonded tungsten, IN Alloy 625 and glass. We are in varying stages of qualifying additional industrial materials for both indirect and direct applications and advancing materials that are printable in our machines, including fine powder capability development.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Chemical Binding. We use liquid chemical binding agents during the printing process. We believe that our unique chemical binding agent technology can more readily achieve efficiency gains over time than other AM technologies, such as laser-fusing technologies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | International Presence. Since our inception, we have structured our business to cater to major international markets. We have established one or more PSCs or EACs in each of North America, Europe and Asia. Because many of our current or potential customers are global industrial companies, it is important that we have a presence in or near the areas where these companies have manufacturing facilities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Co-location of High Value Production. Over the last few years, many United States industrial manufacturers have outsourced products supply or otherwise created long, relatively inflexible supply chains for their high-complexity, high-value products. We believe that over the next few years, many of these companies will need to build these products in the United States near their primary manufacturing facilities in order to be competitive domestically and internationally. We believe we are well positioned to help these manufacturers co-locate the production of products so as to optimize our customers’ supply chains.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Business Strategy 
 The principal elements of our growth strategy include: 
  
• | Increase the Efficiency and Capabilities of Our Machines to Expand the Addressable Market. We intend to invest in further developing our machine technology so as to increase the volumetric output per unit of time that our machines can produce for both direct and indirect applications. We also intend to invest in continued advancements to the core capabilities of our equipment, these core capabilities include broadening the range of material particle sizes that can be printed in our equipment (with particular emphasis on fine powder capabilities for direct printing technologies), enhanced real-time process monitoring, improved material handling, and improvements to overall machine post-printing productivity.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Qualify New Industrial Materials Printable In Our Systems. Our 3D printing machines are used for both development and commercial printing. We believe that the variety of materials printable in our printing systems is more diverse than competing 3D printing technologies. By expanding both qualified and printable materials (with particular emphasis on fine powder capabilities for direct printing technologies), we believe we can expand our market share and better serve our industrial customer base.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reducing Overall Costs of Operating Our Machines. We continue to reduce costs associated with operating our 3D printing machines. We collaborate with customers and suppliers to qualify locally based, lower cost printing materials. We seek to reduce the cost of our 3D printing machine manufacturing process and lower the cost of replacement parts for our 3D printing machines. We use a variety of means, including traditional supply chain and development projects, to reduce those costs. We believe as we lower 3D printing machine run costs we will improve adoption rate by forming more cost efficient production processes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance Pre-Print Design and Post-Print Processing Capabilities to Accelerate the Growth of Our 3D Printing Technology. Our next generation 3D printing machine platforms have achieved the volumetric output rate and quality necessary to serve industrial markets on a production scale. We believe that there is an opportunity to similarly advance the pre-print and post-print processing phases of product materialization to more fully exploit the transformative power of our 3D printing machines and drive growth. These opportunities relate to both direct and indirect printing. For direct printing, we believe that enhancing pre-print processes, notably design optimization tools and suitable print material availability, can greatly accelerate our capture of market share. Additionally, enhancements to post-print processing will increase the applications for printed products. In indirect printing utilizing 3D printed molds and cores, advanced performance casting technologies can be leveraged to increase yields and reduce weight of casted products. To promote this advantage to the market we have developed a suite of processes, many of which are proprietary, for producing high-quality castings.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Implement a Network of Production Service Centers and ExOne Adoption Centers to Increase Customer Collaboration. Our centers provide a central location for customer collaboration and provide customers with a direct contact point to learn about our 3D printing technology, purchase products printed by us, and purchase our 3D printing machines. To facilitate faster adoption of our technology, we are refocusing certain of our PSCs located in the United States into EACs to provide a greater variety of our latest binder and material sets, as well as an expanded range of our machine platforms and machine options. We expect our EACs will create more robust, regionally-based material development services, as well as technical and training services. Each center is located in a major industrial center near existing and potential customers. We continuously monitor both customer and market trends in assessing the opportunity to further expand our global network.

Our Machines and Machine Platforms 
 We produce a variety of 3D printing machines in order to enable designers and engineers to rapidly, efficiently, and cost-effectively design and produce industrial prototypes and production parts. The models of our 3D printing machines differ based on the materials in which they print, build box size, and production speeds, but all utilize our advanced technology and designs. The variation in the models of 3D printing machines that we produce allows for flexibility of use based on the needs of our customers. 
 Exerial. The Exerial is our largest format indirect 3D printing machine. It is unique compared to our other indirect 3D printing systems in that it contains multiple industrial stations that allow for continuous production and simultaneous processing. The Exerial is distinctly equipped with two build boxes, each 1.5 times larger than the single build box in our next largest model, the S-Max. Notably, the Exerial system offers a total build platform of 3,168 liters and is expected to be capable of printing output rates nearly four times faster than the S-Max. The Exerial utilizes an advanced recoater system, multiple printheads and automation controls. As part of the development of the Exerial, we have filed six patents related to machine design elements. We formally debuted this 3D printing machine at the GIFA International Foundry Trade Fair in Dusseldorf, Germany in June 2015. We are in the process of re-designing certain elements of this platform to increase its flexibility for purposes of customer integration.
 S-Max/S-Max+. The S-Max machine is our most widely utilized indirect 3D printing machine. We introduced the S-Max machine in 2010 to provide improved size and speed over the predecessor model, the S-15. The S-Max has a build box size of 1,800mm x 1,000mm x 700mm. The S-Max machine is generally used by customers interested in printing complex molds and cores on an industrial scale for casting applications. Each of our global PSCs and EACs has at least one S-Max machine installed on-site. In addition to our traditional S-Max machine, during 2014 we introduced an S-Max+ configuration designed for easier post-processing of the build box for certain applications which require phenolic or sodium silicate binder for printing.
 S-Print/M-Print. The S-Print (indirect) and M-Print (direct) machines are our mid-sized 3D printing machines presently available. Both the S-Print and M-Print have a build box size of 800mm x 500mm x 400mm. The S-Print machine is generally used by customers interested in printing objects made from silica sand and ceramics, with a particular focus on industrial applications for smaller casting cores that are often required for the aerospace applications. The build box size also permits the use of exotic and expensive print materials, such as ceramics, that are required for high heat/high strength applications. The M-Print machine is generally used by customers interested in direct printing of objects made from metals. We have installed both S-Print and M-Print machines in certain of our PSCs and EACs to complement our S-Max machines currently in use. 
 M-Flex. The M-Flex machine is our most flexible direct 3D printing machine presently available. We introduced the M-Flex machine platform in 2013 to satisfy the demand for a large range of industrial customers that are interested in directly printing metal products. The M-Flex has a build box size of 400mm x 250mm x 250mm.  
 6


Innovent. The Innovent is the smallest of our direct 3D printing machines presently available. As an industrial-grade, laboratory-sized machine, Innovent allows for testing material properties, specifically in educational institutions, research laboratories, and research and development departments at commercial organizations. Innovent is uniquely designed in that it balances a specific build box for the technical qualification of materials with a smaller overall lab machine platform size, when compared to other industrial-grade 3D printing machines. In 2016, we introduced our fine powder Innovent machine that 3D prints metal and ceramic objects that have higher printed density and achieves significant improvements in surface finish quality, ideally suited for the metal injection molding and powder metallurgy industries. We offer a fine powder Innovent machine, as well as an Innovent upgrade package for existing equipment. 
 Binding Agents
 We use liquid chemical binding agents (including furan, phenolic and sodium silicate) during the 3D printing process. We initially introduced the availability of phenolic binding agent in July 2013, which binder is used with ceramic sands in the 3D printing of molds and cores, offering customers three primary benefits as compared with other binders:

• | Casting higher heat alloys;
--+----------------------------


• | Creating a higher strength mold or core; and
--+---------------------------------------------


• | Improving the quality of the casting due to reduced expansion of the mold or core.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In September 2015, we expanded our suite of 3D printing binder offerings to add a new class of phenolic binding agent, referred to as cold hardening phenolic ("CHP"). The CHP binder accelerates the 3D printing process by eliminating the infrared heating lamp that is utilized in the printing process with traditional phenolic binders. Using CHP, the polymerization of 3D printed molds and cores may occur at room temperature, further reducing both printing and curing time and eliminating the need for additional equipment such as a microwave. Alternatively, if additional drying is desired this may be achieved in a conventional air oven, equipment which is maintained by most industrial manufacturers. We have qualified CHP on our S-Print and S-Max indirect printing machine platforms and are in the process of optimizing our indirect printing machine platforms for utilization of CHP.
 Sodium silicate reduces or eliminates the release of fumes and gas in the casting process, helping to reduce costs associated with air ventilation and electrical and maintenance equipment, which we believe will appeal to casting houses that are in search of cleaner environmental processes. 
 We believe that our unique chemical binding agent technology can more readily achieve efficiency gains over time than other AM technologies such as laser-fusing technologies. 
 Marketing and Sales 
 We market our products under the ExOne brand name in three major geographic regions — North America, Europe and Asia. Our sales are made primarily by our global sales force. Our sales force is augmented, in certain territories, by representatives with specific industry or territorial expertise. Even where we are supported by a representative, substantially all of our product and service offerings provided by our PSCs and EACs are sold directly to customers by us. 
 We believe that our direct selling relationship helps to create one of the building blocks for our business — the creation of true collaboration between us and industrial customers who are interested in 3D printing. Increasingly, industrial producers are considering shifting from subtractive manufacturing techniques to 3D printing. Our marketing efforts include educating potential customers about 3D printing technology through collaboration starting with pre-production services and continuing with production and technical support at our PSCs and EACs. 
 Services and Warranty 
 We have fully trained service technicians to perform machine installations in North America, Europe and Asia. We generally provide a standard twelve month warranty on sales of 3D printing machines. Customers can purchase additional service contracts for maintenance and service. We also sell replacement parts which we maintain in stock worldwide to assist in providing service expeditiously to our customers. 
 Suppliers 
 Our largest suppliers in 2017, based upon dollar volume of purchases, were Bauer GmbH & Co KG, Erhardt & Leimer GmbH, Fuji Film Dimatix and Astro Manufacturing & Design. 
 We buy our industrial materials from several suppliers and, except as set forth below, the loss of any one would not materially adversely affect our business. We currently have a single supplier of certain printhead components for our 3D printing machines. While we believe that this printhead component supplier is replaceable, in the event of the loss of this supplier, we could experience delays and interruptions that might adversely affect the financial performance of our business. Additionally, we obtain certain pre-production services through design and data capture providers, and certain post-production services though vendors with whom we have existing and good relationships. The loss of any one of these providers or vendors would not materially adversely affect our business.

Research and Development 
 We spent approximately $9.9 million, $7.8 million and $7.3 million on research and development during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect to continue to invest in our research and development activities in the future. 
 A significant portion of our research and development expenditures have been focused on the following: 
  
• | Chemistry of print materials and binder formulation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Mechanics of droplet flight into beds of powder;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Metallurgy of thermally processing metals that are printed through AM;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mechanics of spreading powders in a job box;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | Transfer of digital data through a series of software links to drive a printhead; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Synchronizing all of the above to print ever-increasing volumes of material per unit time.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property 
 Patents and Licenses. Significant portions of our technology are covered by a variety of patents. Through December 31, 2016, we were the worldwide licensee of certain patents held by MIT for certain AM printing processes (the “MIT Patents”), with exclusive rights to practice the patents in certain fields including the application of the printing processes to metals (with sublicensing rights), and non-exclusive rights to practice the patents in certain fields including the application of the printing processes to certain non-metals (without sublicensing rights) which gave us a significant head start in the AM industry. 
 We continue from time to time to evaluate our current licenses and patents. On March 1, 2018, our ExOne GmbH subsidiary notified Voxeljet AG that it has materially breached a 2003 Patent and Know-How Transfer Agreement and asserted its rights to set off damages as a result of the breaches against the annual license fee that we pay to Voxeljet AG under the agreement.
 We hold patents as a result of our own technological developments. Our patents were issued in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions, including Germany and Japan. As a result of our commitment to research and development, we also have applied for other patents for equipment, processes, materials and 3D printing applications in the United States and in various foreign countries. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2023 to 2036. We are also a minority owner of patent rights of several patents in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions as a successor interest to a 2003 Agreement made between Generis GmbH and Extrude Hone GmbH.
  We have developed know-how and trade secrets relative to our 3D printing technology and believe that our early entrance into the industrial market provides us with a timing and experience advantage. Through our investment in our technology, we have been able to qualify industrial materials for use in our 3D printing machines and we intend to continue such efforts. In addition, we have taken steps to protect much of our technology as a trade secret. Given the significant steps that we have taken to establish our experience in AM for industrial applications, as well as our ongoing commitment to research and development, we intend to maintain our preeminent position in the AM industry market.
Trademarks. We have registrations in the United States for the following trademarks: EXONE, X1 ExOne Digital Part Materialization (plus design), EXCAST, EXMAL, EXTEC, INNOVENT, M-FLEX, M-PRINT, S MAX, S-MAX, S-PRINT, X1, and X1-LAB. We also have an application in the United States for registration pending for the following trademark: EXERIAL. We also have registrations for EXONE in China, Europe (Community Trade Mark), Japan, and South Korea, and an application for registration pending in Canada for that trademark. We have registrations for X1 ExOne Digital Part Materialization (plus design) in Brazil, China, Europe (Community Trade Mark), Japan, and South Korea, and an application for registration pending in Canada for that mark. We have a registration for the mark X1 in Europe (Community Trade Mark). We have a registration for the mark EX-1 in Europe (Community Trade Mark). We have registrations for a stylized form of X1 in Europe (Community Trade Mark) and South Korea. We have registrations for DIGITAL PART MATERIALIZATION in Japan and South Korea. We have registrations for the trademarks EXERIAL, INNOVENT, M-FLEX, S-MAX, and S-PRINT in Europe (Community Trade Mark).
 Trade Secrets. The development of our products, processes and materials has involved a considerable amount of experience, manufacturing and processing know-how and research and development techniques that are not easily duplicated. We protect this knowledge as a trade secret through the confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements which all employees, customers and consultants are required to sign at the time they are employed or engaged by us. Additional information related to the risks associated with our intellectual property rights are described within Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Competition 
 Other companies are active in the market for 3D printing products and services. These companies use a variety of AM technologies, including: 
  
• | Direct metal deposition;
--+-------------------------


• | Direct metal laser sintering;
--+------------------------------

• | Electron beam melting;
--+-----------------------


• | Fused deposition modeling;
--+---------------------------


• | Laser consolidation;
--+---------------------


• | Laser sintering;
--+-----------------


• | Multi-jet modeling;
--+--------------------


• | Polyjet;
--+---------


• | Selective laser melting;
--+-------------------------


• | Selective laser sintering; and
--+-------------------------------


• | Stereolithography.
--+-------------------

 Some of the companies that have developed and employ one or more AM technologies include: Hoganas AB, Viridus3d, 3D Systems Corporation, Stratasys Inc., HP Inc., EOS GmbH, EnvisionTEC, Concept Laser, Solid Model Ltd., Voxeljet AG and General Electric Co.
 Some of these processes and companies compete with some of the products and services that we provide. Despite the challenging competitive landscape, we believe that we are the only AM printing solutions provider that focuses primarily on metal industrial applications on a production scale. Our competitive advantages, including the size of our build platforms, the speed of our printheads, the variety of materials used by industrial manufacturers in which we can print, the industry qualification of many of the materials we print in, our robust market capabilities, and our suite of machine system families offering scale and flexibility, also serve to differentiate us from the other competitors in the AM market. 
 We also compete with established subtractive manufacturers in the industrial products market. These companies often provide large-scale, highly capitalized facilities that are designed or built to fill specific production purposes, usually mass production. However, we believe that we are well positioned to expand our share of the industrial products market from these manufacturers as AM gains recognition. As our technologies improve and our unit cost of production decreases, we expect to be able to compete with subtractive manufacturing on a wide range of products, thereby expanding our addressable market. 
 Seasonality 
 Purchases of our 3D printing machines are often subject to the capital expenditure cycles of our customers. Generally, 3D printing machine sales are higher in our third and fourth quarters than in our first and second quarters; however as acceptance of our 3D printing machines as a credible alternative to traditional methods of production grows, we expect to limit the seasonality we experience. 
Backlog 
 At December 31, 2017, our backlog was approximately $21.3 million, of which, approximately $18.3 million is expected to be fulfilled during the next twelve months. At December 31, 2016, our backlog was approximately $19.7 million. 
Environmental Matters 
 Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material impact on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of us and our subsidiaries. We are not the subject of any legal or administrative proceeding relating to the environmental laws of the United States or any country in which we have an office. We have not received any notices of any violations of any such environmental laws. 
Employees 
 At December 31, 2017, we employed a total of 302 (277 full-time) employees at our seven global locations. None of these employees is a party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relations with them are good.
