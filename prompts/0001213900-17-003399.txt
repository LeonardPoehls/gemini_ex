ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
-------------------------------------------------+---------

 
We conduct our operations through our consolidated affiliate Shenzhen Wonhe Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Shenzhen Wonhe”).  Shenzhen Wonhe, founded in November 2010, is a high tech company specializing in research and development, outsourced-manufacturing and marketing of high-end business and personal information technology products.  Shenzhen Wonhe is located in Shenzhen, People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). 
 
Our Corporate History and Background

Wonhe High-Tech International, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 13, 2007 under the name “Baby Fox International, Inc.”  Until June 30, 2011, the Company was a specialty retailer, developer, and designer of fashionable, value-priced women’s apparel and accessories. On June 30, 2011, the Company entered into and closed a Reorganization Agreement under which it disposed of its prior business operations and became a shell company. 
 
On June 27, 2012, we completed a reverse acquisition through a share exchange with World Win International Holding Ltd (BVI), a corporation organized in the British Virgin Islands (“World Win”). We acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of World Win in exchange for 19,128,130 shares of our common stock, which constituted 80.0% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. As a result of the reverse acquisition, World Win became our wholly-owned subsidiary and the former shareholders of World Win became our controlling stockholders. The share exchange was treated for accounting purposes as a reverse acquisition, with World Win as the acquirer and the Company as the acquired party.
 
World Win was established in the British Virgin Islands on April 5, 2012, at which time it acquired ownership of Kuayu International Holdings Group Ltd. (Hong Kong), an entity established in Hong Kong (“Kuayu”) on January 11, 2012 to serve as an intermediate holding company. On April 6, 2012, the local government of the PRC issued a certificate of approval regarding the acquisition by Kuayu of Shengshihe Management Consulting (Shanzhen) Co., Ltd., an entity established in the PRC on April 17, 2012 (“Shengshihe Consulting”). 
 
Until September 15, 2015, the business of Shengshihe Consulting was to provide management services to Shenzhen Wonhe. The services were provided pursuant to a set of four agreements among Shengshihe Consulting, Shenzhen Wonhe and the shareholders of Shenzhen Wonhe: Youliang Wang, Qing Tong, Jingwu Li and Nanfang Tong. The four agreements assigned to Shengshihe Consulting over 95% of the benefit arising from the operations of Shenzhen Wonhe as well as control of the corporate activities of that entity. As a result, for accounting purposes, Shenzhen Wonhe was considered a variable interest entity with respect to Shengshihe Consulting, and the balance sheet and financial results of Shenzhen Wonhe were consolidated with those of the Company in our financial statements.

On September 15, 2015 Shengshihe Consulting exercised its option to purchase all of the registered equity of Shenzhen Wonhe. The purchase price paid for the equity was RMB10,000 (approximately $1,440). The equity was purchased from the Shenzhen Wonhe Shareholders, each of whom is a member of the Company’s Board of Directors. From that date forward, the financial results of Shenzhen Wonhe have been consolidated as a subsidiary of Shengshihe Consulting.
 
Australian Wonhe
 
In July 2015, World Win organized Wonhe Multimedia Commerce Ltd. (“Australian Wonhe”) under Australian law. 60% of the capital stock of Australian Wonhe was issued to World Win. 25% was issued to Wonhe International (Hong Kong), which is wholly owned and controlled by Qing Tong, who is Chairman of the Board of the Company. The remaining 15% was issued to three non-affiliated financial consultants. On August 5, 2015, World Win sold all of the outstanding capital stock of Kuayu to Australian Wonhe. In exchange for Kuayu, Australian Wonhe paid World Win $10,000 Hong Kong Dollars (US $1,290). Since Kuayu is the sole owner of Shengshihe Consulting, which in turn owns our operating company, Shenzhen Wonhe, the effect of the sale of Kuayu was to reduce the Company’s interest in its operating entity by 40%.
 
On December 21, 2015, Australia Wonhe was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”) and sold 16,951,802 of its ordinary shares for net proceeds of US$1,941,318. As a result, the Company’s beneficial ownership of Shenzhen Wonhe has been reduced to 53.3%.
 
On October 31, 2016 Australian Wonhe paid an interim dividend of AU$637,190 (US$486,500) to its shareholders; on May 31, 2017 Australian Wonhe will pay a final dividend for 2016 totaling AU$893,000 (US$643,140). The dividends are tax-free in Australia. 53.3% of each dividend is payable to World Win, as the owner of 53.3% of the outstanding shares of Australian Wonhe. The funds payable to World Win have been retained by Shengshihe Consulting in an escrow account pursuant to an agreement among World Win, Australian Wonhe and Shengshihe Consulting, which provides that the funds cannot be disbursed for any purpose without the approval of the board of directors of World Win. The Company plans to use the escrowed funds, in part, to pay the Company’s expenses incurred in the U.S. and Australia in connection with its public stock listings in those nations.
 
As a result of the reorganization and offering on the ASX during 2015, our current organizational structure is as follows:

Business Overview
 
Shenzhen Wonhe is a high-tech enterprise which specializes in research and development and the marketing of high-end business and personal IT products that provide third party application services. In 2011 we introduced our first product, a Home Media Center. Our initial Home Media Center, the “HMC660”, was marketed exclusively in Guangdong Province. However, in October 2014 we introduced our second generation home media center, the “HMC720”, which we developed in order to meet government purchasing standards in additional provinces, and thus allow the expansion of our market.
 
In March 2015 we expanded our product offerings with the introduction of our YLT-100S Wifi Router. This was followed in June 2015 by our YLT-300S Wifi Router, and in October 2016 by our YLT-300J Wifi Router. The YLT-100S and YLT-300J are marketed primarily for home use; the YLT-300S is designed for larger commercial networks. Our “Smart Routers” have a complex operating system that provides users a broad range of capabilities, allowing smart management of networks and devices.

HMC720 Home Media Center
 
The HMC720 is a data storage, management and control center for household equipment, and a central processing center which uses remote wireless technology to allow a user to control various devices while at home or remotely when away from home. HMC720 provides a software platform that has the functional characteristics of both a family security device and a direct TV receiver, with the ability to access TV and video on demand, as well as to function as a game console and storage facility for family and business information. HMC720 can be used to watch satellite programs, read CD-ROMs and video files, support Wifi functions, share broadband access, support 3G module functions, and can be adapted to include other applications.
 
Our HMC720 includes the fourth-generation Intel program and 4G memory. The HMC720 uses a 2.5 inch 1T hard disk as well as a dual band processing system to ensure the successful reception of signals, and to guarantee a clear image. In addition to supporting MPEG-1/2/4, H.264, H.263, WMV7/8/9, Divx and other formats, HMC720 adds the rapid hardware function and stable play function of APEG. HMC720 products are sensitive in speed regulation and key press, along with having excellent thermal dissipation function. The noise is lower than 20 decibels. Thus, users can have interactive digital recreation, education and commercial activities at the same time that they watch digital television programs.
 
We believe our HMC720 has the following favorable traits and advantages compared to other similar products currently available in the marketplace:
 

1. | Excellent performance: good audio and video decoding capability equipped with high-performance CPU and AV chips, supporting 1080P high definition play and 7.1 sound track HIFI effect.

Smart Routers
 
The operating system in our Smart Routers incorporates a BCM4709 dual core 1GHz processor, which is uncommon in routers. This enhanced processing power enables router to offer users control over bandwidth, online access and web browsing, as well as the ability to install any number of applications, all under the protection of a built-in firewall and 64/128 bit WEP encryption. With strong USB sharing capabilities, our Smart Routers facilitate management of networks and devices by individually controlling the download or upload bandwidth of a specified port and enabling transfers to an associated storage device. Effectively, our Smart Routers integrate the functions of a router, four-interface switch, wireless access point and firewall into a single device.
 
Our Smart Routers are manufactured using an aluminum alloy, which not only provides a smooth and shiny futuristic appearance, but protects the main board and chip from damage and significantly reduces heat loss. Our Smart Routers meet IEEE802.11n, IEEE802.11g and IEEE802.11b standards, while providing wireless transmission rates up to 300Mbps. With QOS fast security settings, the routers allow users to set up wireless security easily. A remote management function permits users to manage the router remotely via the Internet.
 
Among the functions available on our Smart Routers are:
 

● | AppStore acceleration. After installation, the App Store Accelerator will increase AppStore download acceleration by up to 1000%. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Adblock function. Our Smart Routers will help users strip away the advertisements that precede most downloaded videos. 
● | Single-threaded download accelerating. Our Smart Routers automatically accelerate the download of zip, rar and exe files by more than 100%. 
● | Mobile phone management. Users can download onto their mobile phones any of three apps that will enable password access to the router for management purposes. 

 
The YLT-300J, which we introduced in 2016, incorporates much of the functionality of the YLT-300S, but in an economic smaller router suitable for domestic use. The following table is a summary comparison of the two products.
 

 | YLT-300S | YLT-300J 
-----------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We initiated sales of the YLT-300J in October 2016, and recorded sales of 13,360 units as of December 31, 2016.
 
Products Under Development
 
Our major product under development is a computer set-top-box (“PC-STB”), which combines the system architecture of a multimedia computer with that of a digital set-top box, and features wireless remote control, fully integrating a family’s multimedia application requirements into a single device. We hope to introduce the PC-STB to the market in July 2017 as an upgrade to our HMC720.
 
In addition, we have seven other hardware products that are in various stages of research and development, including a domestic mini-terminal server, a minicomputer, an All-In-One PC, an ARM panel personal computer and an Android smartphone. We have also completed development of a Wonhe applications platform and a metropolitan business information website, which we will integrate with our future product offerings.
 
Our Industry

In the description below we rely on certain information and statistics regarding our industry and the economy in China that we derived from the “National Informatization Plan” included in the 13th Five Year Plan of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China. We have no reason to believe that the information and statistics we cite are not accurate.
 
In recent years the electronic information products industry has achieved growth rates above that of the overall Chinese economy. In 2015, the PRC electronic information products industry achieved 17.1 trillion RMB in sales revenue. The nation’s output of intelligent terminals, communications equipment, and other electronic information products ranked first in the world, and a number of world-class network enterprises have been emerging. With the continuing growth of China’s national economy and the anticipated continuation of the transformation of Chinese society to a more western-style information economy, market demand for electronic information products is expected to continue to grow faster than the overall economy.
 
Today the electronic information industry is viewed by many countries as a leading strategic industry. The rapid promotion of global information, the development of cross-border investment, and the transnational transmission of information, have enhanced the value of the electronic information industry. As the Chinese electronic information industry has grown, international competition has continued to increase. Despite the growth in the Chinese electronic information industry, some bottle-neck issues have developed, such as technical limitations, capital restrictions, availability of personnel, as well as increasing costs and a decrease in foreign-funded investment in recent years as a result of the macro-environment changes in China and abroad. Despite these problems, we believe the electronics information industry will continue to grow, based on the following trends:
 

1. | The electronic information industry has a solid history of growth. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Since 2000, the Chinese domestic electronic information industry has consistently experienced rapid growth and has always been a leading industry in the whole national economy.  As of the end of 2015, the number of Internet users had reached 688 million, the Internet penetration rate was 50.3%, and the number of Internet users and users with broadband access ranked first in the world. The third generation mobile communications network (3G) covers all of the townships in China; the commercial use of the fourth generation mobile communications network (4G) has expanded nationwide; and China holds a leading position in research and development of the fifth generation network. At the same time, the speed of China’s communications network is accelerating and the cost of usage is decreasing. And the move toward integration of the Internet with broadband radio television and wireless satellite communications is steadily advancing.

2. | Technological innovation is being improved. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Since 2000, the rate of innovation in the electronic information industry has grown rapidly. Advances in processor technology, the Chinese Linux operating system, the third generation of mobile communications, cluster communications and digital television technology all serve to confirm that China has valuable intellectual property that has narrowed the gap with the global state of the art. In particular, the development of TD-SCDMA technology as a Chinese standard has enabled the communications industry in China to achieve performance levels competitive with the best standards available.
 
3.      Regional industrial clusters are emerging.
 
The potentially huge domestic electronic information products market, the availability of abundant low-priced manpower, the availability of a broad array of resources, and the continuously improving investment environment are all key factors attracting foreign companies and investors to establish business bases in China. Foreign capital accelerates the development of China’s electronic information industry, particularly in the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta and Bohai. These areas have the good industrial base, strong ability to provide the auxiliary items necessary for growth, and the strong service consciousness from government necessary to attract foreign capital investments, and promote the development of local industries.
 
The specific niche in the electronic information products market occupied by Shenzhen Wonhe should benefit from this confluence of positive trends. In the 13th five-year plan, the government emphasized that industry should promote the integration of the telecommunication and broadcast networks with the capabilities of the computer. Toward that end, all of the relevant departments in the country are actively implementing the tri-networks integration project. The technology developed by Shenzhen Wonhe can play a leading role in that process.
 
Competition
 
Our products will compete with other manufacturers and providers of electronic furniture and digital/multimedia home entertainment systems, such as Shenzhen Huawei Technology Co., Ltd, Datang Tele-Communication Technology Co., Ltd., Haier Group, TCL Group Co., and Lenovo Group Co., Ltd. We compete on the basis of style, price, quality, comfort and brand name prestige and recognition, among other considerations.
 
Our home media center (“HMC”) entertainment system competes with numerous well-known domestic brands such as Huawei, Haier, TCL and Lenovo, as well as well-known foreign brands such as Samsung and Apple iPad. Due to the lower costs and labor expenses in Asia Pacific regions, many international HMC manufacturers are establishing plants in Asia. This allows large manufacturers to compete with local manufacturers in pricing. Many of our competitors are larger in scale, have been in existence for a longer period of time, have achieved greater recognition for their brand names, have captured greater market shares and/or have substantially greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do.

Our routers compete with domestics companies such as Shenzhen Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., as well as multinational providers such as Xiaomi Company. We expect our routers to compete on the basis of stability, speed (our Wifi routers are three times faster than 4G) and, most especially, the extensive array of functions offered by our Smart Routers.
 
Our Growth Strategy

For the foreseeable future we intend to continue to emphasize the development of multimedia devices capable of integrating telecommunication, broadcast and computer (internet) networks.  In addition, we intend to focus on the development of panel personal computers (i.e. portable pads,“PPC’s”) and smartphones.  The telecommunications market in China is undergoing rapid development and there is a growing demand for portable media devices to be integrated into GSM and TD-SCDMA networks.  If we are successful in developing such products, in addition to offering them to electronic products distributors, we will seek to enter into joint marketing or other cooperative agreements with mobile telecom carriers in China.
Business Partnerships - Media Devices
 
The company intends to utilize its social resources in an effort to develop business partnerships with China’s largest telecom operators. Among the programs that our strategic development staff will pursue are:

● | Research into the preferences of China Mobile with regard to PPC and smart phone design, followed by intensive development efforts to resolve the technological problems that currently prevent China Mobile from satisfying those preferences. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cooperation with the government-enterprise customer departments of China Mobile, which is the largest mobile telecom carrier in China based on the GSM and TD-SCDMA network. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Efforts to establish business partnership with China United Network Communications Group Co, Ltd., the largest telecom operator in China, and China Telecommunications Corporation, a large state-owned telecommunication company, to combine our sales of smart phone products with telecommunication services provided by those operators. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Although we intend to make efforts to establish these business relationships, there is no guarantee that we will succeed.
 
Since 2010, agencies of the Chinese government have expressed a national policy favoring tri-network integration (i.e. film and cable TV, video communication, web browser) throughout China in order to improve communications content, increase network security, and promote the Chinese telecommunications industry. Participants in the telecommunications industry have also stressed the need for further advances in this area. For this reason, we intend to focus our development efforts on products that will help to achieve this goal. To date our development efforts have been carried out by our in-house research and development staff. If, in the future, we require special expertise in order to provide customers with special tri-network applications, we will seek a cooperative arrangement with an application service provider capable of providing the necessary technical expertise.

Business Partnerships - Routers
 
We plan to utilize our business relationships for the growth of our router business as well. Our initial accomplishment in that regard was the formation of a joint venture with Guangdong Kesheng Enterprise Co., Ltd. (“Guangdong Kesheng”) in January 2016, when Shenzhen Wonhe entered into an agreement titled “Wireless Network Coverage Project in Beijing Area” with Guangdong Kesheng. The agreement contemplated that the two parties would work together to develop a wireless network in certain designated areas of Beijing. The commercial purpose of the network was to serve as a vehicle for advertising and marketing, with the income to be shared between Shenzhen Wonhe and Guangdong Kesheng. Shenzhen Wonhe committed in the agreement to make a capital contribution of 382,990,000 RMB (USD $55.15 million) to the project. Shenzhen Wonhe also committed to develop the data systems that will be used by the network. Guangdong Kesheng committed to supervise the engineering and construction, coordinate relationships with local government, and manage the network’s operations.
 
On November 30, 2016 Shenzhen Wonhe and Guangdong Kesheng signed an amendment to the January agreement. The amendment, titled “Cooperative Agreement on Wireless Network Coverage Project in Beijing Area”, terminated the participation of Shenzhen Wonhe in the construction and operation of the wireless network, and also terminated the commitment of Shenzhen Wonhe to develop the data systems used by the network. Shenzhen Wonhe has no further obligation to contribute capital to the project, and will receive no distribution of income from the project. Shenzhen Wonhe will, however, supply 36,300 routers for the project prior to the end of 2017, and Guangdong Kesheng will pay Shenzhen Wonhe 1,800 RMB ($259) for each router.
 
As of November 30, 2016 Shenzhen Wonhe had contributed to the wireless network project cash, equipment, engineering, and a pilot project in the Tongzhou District of Beijing. The total contribution of 175,755,641 RMB (USD$25.31 million) will be repaid to Shenzhen Wonhe in three equal annual installments; the unpaid portion of that obligation will accrue interest at 4.75% per annum.
 
Our Marketing Strategy
 
Our marketing strategy will entail the establishment of a national network of dedicated sales agencies and distributors for our products. As we introduce products, Shenzhen Wonhe will first sell the product to local sales agencies and distributors to introduce the products to the market. As demand grows, we will transition to exclusive distribution and sales channels. Support for the marketing effort will involve a five prong program:

1. | Design a “Wonhe Vision Identity”; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Build “Wonhe” brand image by unifying the appearance of all regional agents as well as the website of Wonhe; 
3. | Secure product reviews on influential IT websites, such as PConline, 3G sina, to enhance the brand image and awareness of Wonhe; 
4. | Engage film stars and celebrities to be image spokespersons to promote Wonhe branded products; 
5. | Seek to place articles about Shenzhen Wonhe and its products in newspapers and elite fashion magazines (e.g. Modern Weekly, Fashion; Popular Science, etc.) in major cities.

 
We currently market the HMC720 Home Media Center through a network of distributors.
 
Our routers are marketed by a single distributor, Shenzhen Yun Lutong Science and Technology Ltd (“YLT”), which is owned by Qing Tong, one of the Company’s directors. YLT markets the YLT-100S and the YLT-300J routers to domestic consumers at a markup over wholesale price. YLT markets our YLT-300S router to commercial customers such as shopping malls and restaurants that offer persons in or near to the establishment Internet access. The sales agreement with commercial customers provides for payment directly for the router plus payment to Shenzhen Wonhe of a commission from retail sales to users who purchase products from a retailer via the Wonhe App.

In April 2015, Shenzhen Wonhe entered into a three -year Strategic Cooperation Agreement with YLT. Under the agreement, as originally executed, YLT committed to purchase 662,000 routers from Shenzhen WONHE, with 200,000 to be purchased during the first year, 220,000 during the second year and 242,000 routers purchased during the third year, for a total purchase price of RMB 926,800,000 (US $133,467,742). The agreement was subsequently amended and restated to replace YLT’s specific purchase commitment with a covenant of mutual cooperation. The following table shows router purchases by YLT since the execution of the agreement.
 

 | Units Purchased | | Price - RMB | | Price - US$
---------------------------------+-----------------+--------+-------------+------------+------------
12 months ended May 31, 2016 | | 51,085 | | 71,519,000 | | $ | 11,161,786
7 months ended December 31, 2016 | | 58,000 | | 81,200,000 | | $ | 12,074,185

 
The Strategic Cooperation Agreement provides that YLT will not sell any equity or issue any debt during the term of the agreement, and that any change in share ownership of YLT must be approved by Shenzhen Wonhe. In addition, Shenzhen Wonhe is given an exclusive right to acquire YLT, at an appraised price, if YLT’s gross annual revenues reach RMB 150,000,000 (US $24,480,000) and net annual profit reaches RMB 12,500,000 (US $2,040,000) during the term of the agreement. To date, neither of those thresholds has been achieved.
 
Production 
 
Shenzhen Wonhe does not engage in manufacturing, but provides technology and purchase orders to qualified manufacturers, which manufacture to our order. Our manufacturers are independent third parties with no relationship to Shenzhen Wonhe or its owners.
 
Although we have dual-sourced our manufacturing in the past, during 2015 Shenzhen Wonhe outsourced the manufacture of all three of its products to a single producer: Shenzhen Tehuilong Electronic R&D Center. In the fall of 2016, when we introduced YLT-300J to the market, we engaged Shenzhen Weimeng Technology Co., Ltd. to manufacture that product.
 
Relying on one manufacturer for each product is a risk to our business. However, in determining to outsource all of our manufacturing to Shenzhen Tehuilong and Shenzhen Weimeng, we considered the following factors:
 

● | Each manufacturer’s production capacity and manufacturing strength are sufficient to satisfy our current annual sales plan. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Every month we ordered a sufficient quantity of products to meet the next month’s demand, which protects us from the risk of non-delivery. 
● | We have been able to maintain close relations with other manufacturers that possess good production technology, and so could secure a replacement for our contracted manufacturer if necessary.

Intellectual Property
 
Research and Development
 
Shenzhen Wonhe possesses a core technology team, most of whom have been engaged in the IT industry for more than 10 years. The members of our technology team specialize in development of hardware, system drivers, industrial design, application software systems and backstage data service.
 
Producers of information technology products face strong pressure to respond quickly to industry demands with new designs and product innovations that support rapidly changing technical demand and regulatory requirements. Shenzhen Wonhe spent approximately $796,145, $142,527 and $92,956 on its research and development efforts for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  
 
Shenzhen Wonhe has produced prototypes of domestic media centers, set top boxes, minicomputers, X86 panel personal computers and ARM panel personal computers, each of which is ready for the production development stage. The initial development of our All-in-One computers and domestic smart servers has been completed and these products have entered into the engineering test stage. However, before we initiate marketing of any of these products, we will have to assess the market demand for the product. We will also have to obtain government approval. The process of applying for and securing government approval of a product can be lengthy; so we cannot predict when we will introduce any new product to the market. We do anticipate, however, that we will introduce our new PC-STB to the market in July of 2017.
 
We have developed client-side application software equipped with the characteristics of mellow human-computer interface, humanized menu design and handy function switchover. We are simultaneously proceeding with cross-platform transplanting to adapt to Windows, Linux and Android OS; software such as resources search engine, video filtering and processing technology, resource allocation and management, disposition and scheme of backstage application and data server are all completed by the Shenzhen Wonhe Application Center.
 
Protection of IP
 
We protect our intellectual property primarily by maintaining strict control over the use of production processes.  All our employees, including key employees and engineers, have signed our standard form of labor contracts, pursuant to which they are obligated to hold in confidence any of our trade secrets, know-how or other confidential information and not to compete with us.  In addition, for each project, only the personnel associated with the project have access to the related intellectual property.  Access to proprietary data is limited to authorized personnel to prevent unintended disclosure or otherwise using our intellectual property without proper authorization.  We will continue to take steps to protect our intellectual property.
 
As we develop new technologies, we secure patent protection from the Chinese patent office (“SIPO”) as needed. The following table lists the patent applications by Shenzhen Wonhe that have been authorized by SIPO:

Regulation
 
Because our operating affiliate, Shenzhen Wonhe, is located in the PRC, our business is regulated by the national and local laws of the PRC. We believe our conduct of business complies with existing PRC laws, rules and regulations.
General Regulation of Businesses
 
We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable labor and safety laws and regulations in the PRC, including the PRC Labor Contract Law, the PRC Production Safety Law, the PRC Regulation for Insurance for Labor Injury, the PRC Unemployment Insurance Law, the PRC Provisional Insurance Measures for Maternity of Employees, PRC Interim Provisions on Registration of Social Insurance, PRC Interim Regulation on the Collection and Payment of Social Insurance Premiums and other related regulations, rules and provisions issued by the relevant governmental authorities from time to time.
 
According to the PRC Labor Contract Law, we are required to enter into labor contracts with our employees. We are required to pay no less than local minimum wages to our employees. We are also required to provide employees with labor safety and sanitation conditions meeting PRC government laws and regulations and carry out regular health examinations of our employees engaged in hazardous occupations.
 
Foreign Currency Exchange
 
The principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in China is the Foreign Currency Administration Rules (1996), as amended (2008). Under these Rules, RMB is freely convertible for current account items, such as trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital account items, such as direct investment, loan or investment in securities outside China unless the prior approval of, and/or registration with, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the People’s Republic of China, or SAFE, or its local counterparts (as the case may be) is obtained.
 
Pursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration Rules, foreign invested enterprises, or FIEs, in China may purchase foreign currency without the approval of SAFE for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions by providing commercial documents evidencing these transactions. They may also retain foreign exchange (subject to a cap approved by SAFE) to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay dividends. In addition, if a foreign company acquires a subsidiary in China, the acquired company will also become an FIE. However, the relevant PRC government authorities may limit or eliminate the ability of FIEs to purchase and retain foreign currencies in the future. In addition, foreign exchange transactions for direct investment, loan and investment in securities outside China are still subject to limitations and require approvals from, and/or registration with, SAFE.
 
Dividend Distribution
 
Under applicable PRC regulations, FIEs in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a FIE in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until the cumulative amount of such reserves reach 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.

The EIT Law and its implementing rules generally provide that a 10% withholding tax applies to China-sourced income derived by non-resident enterprises for PRC enterprise income tax purposes unless the jurisdiction of incorporation of such enterprises’ shareholder has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement. Shengshihe Consulting is considered a FIE and is directly held by our subsidiary in Hong Kong, Kuayu. According to a 2006 tax treaty between the Mainland and Hong Kong, dividends payable by an FIE in China to the company in Hong Kong that directly holds at least 25% of the equity interests in the FIE will be subject to a no more than 5% withholding tax. We expect that such 5% withholding tax will apply to dividends paid to Kuayu by Shengshihe Consulting, but this treatment will depend on our status as a non-resident enterprise.
 
Employees
 
We have a total of 51 full-time employees and no part-time employees.
