Item 1.  Business
Business
 
The Community Financial Corporation (the “Company’) is a bank holding company organized in 1989 under the laws of the State of Maryland. It owns all the outstanding shares of capital stock of Community Bank of the Chesapeake (the “Bank”), a Maryland-chartered commercial bank. The Bank was organized in 1950 as Tri-County Building and Loan Association of Waldorf, a mutual savings and loan association, and in 1986 converted to a federal stock savings bank and adopted the name Tri-County Federal Savings Bank. In 1997, the Bank converted to a Maryland-chartered commercial bank and adopted the name Community Bank of Tri-County. Effective October 18, 2013, Community Bank changed its name to become Community Bank of the Chesapeake.
 
The Company engages in no significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank and operating the business of the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this 10-K, including financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank and its subsidiaries.
 
The Bank maintains its main office and operations center in Waldorf, Maryland, in addition to its branch offices in Lexington Park, Leonardtown, La Plata, Dunkirk, Bryans Road, Waldorf, Charlotte Hall, Prince Frederick and Lusby, Maryland; and Central Park and downtown Fredericksburg, Virginia. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company agreed to sell its King George, Virginia branch building and equipment and the transaction closed on January 28, 2016. In addition, the Bank maintains five loan production offices (“LPOs”) in La Plata, Prince Frederick, Leonardtown and Annapolis, Maryland and Central Park in Fredericksburg, Virginia. The Leonardtown and Central Park LPOs are co-located with branches. The Annapolis LPO opened in October 2014.
 
The Bank operates 16 automated teller machines including four stand-alone locations. The Bank offers telephone and internet banking services. The Bank is engaged in the commercial and retail banking business as authorized by the banking statutes of the States of Maryland and Virginia and applicable federal regulations, including the acceptance of deposits, and the origination of loans to individuals, associations, partnerships and corporations. The Bank’s real estate portfolio consists of commercial mortgage loans, residential first and second mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit. Commercial lending consists of both secured and unsecured loans. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the Bank’s primary federal regulator.
 
Market Area
 The Bank considers its principal lending and deposit market area to consist of the tri-county area in Southern Maryland and the greater Fredericksburg market in Virginia. As a result of the Bank’s expansion into the greater Fredericksburg market in 2013, Stafford County has become part of the Bank’s principal lending and deposit market area. The Annapolis LPO opening in October 2014 provided additional market expansion opportunities in 2015. Our market area is one of the fastest growing regions in the country and is home to a mix of federal facilities, industrial and high-tech businesses.

The presence of several major federal facilities located within the Bank’s footprint and in adjoining counties contribute to economic growth. Major federal facilities include the Patuxent River Naval Air Station in St. Mary’s County, the Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center in Charles County and the Naval Surface Warfare –Naval Support Facility in King George County. In addition, there are several major federal facilities located in adjoining markets including Andrews Air Force Base and Defense Intelligence Agency & Defense Intelligence Analysis Center in Prince Georges County, Maryland and the U.S. Marine Base Quantico, Drug Enforcement Administration Quantico facility and Federal Bureau of Investigation Quantico facility in Prince William County, Virginia. These facilities directly employ thousands of local employees and serve as an important player in the region’s overall economic health.
 
The economic health of the region, while stabilized by the influence of the federal government, is not solely dependent on this sector. Calvert County is home to the Dominion Power Cove Point Liquid Natural Gas Terminal, which is one of the nation’s largest liquefied natural gas terminals and Dominion Power is currently constructing liquefaction facilities for exporting liquefied natural gas. Based on information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment rates in the Company’s footprint have historically remained well below the national average.
 
The Bank expanded into the greater Fredericksburg, Virginia market in August 2013. According to the Fredericksburg Regional Alliance, the Fredericksburg Region, including the City of Fredericksburg and the counties of Caroline, King George, Spotsylvania, and Stafford, Virginia, has been the fastest growing region in the Commonwealth of Virginia for the last five years.
 
The Bank’s primary market areas also boast a strong median household income. According to SNL Financial, the median household income in 2016 was between $87,000 and $88,500 in our market areas compared to slightly less than $56,000 for the United States. According to SNL Financial, the Bank’s market areas have strong demographics with below average unemployment rates. The Bank’s primary market areas have unemployment rates below 3.9% with projected population growth in excess of 4.5% over the next five years.
 
Competition
 The Bank faces strong competition in the attraction of deposits and in the origination of loans. Its most direct competition for deposits and loans comes from other banks, savings and loan associations and federal and state credit unions located in its primary market area. There are more than 25 FDIC-insured depository institutions operating in the Bank’s footprint including subsidiaries of several large regional and national bank holding companies. The Bank also faces additional significant competition for customers’ funds from mutual funds, brokerage firms, online Banks, and other financial service companies. The Bank competes for loans by providing competitive rates and flexibility of terms and service, including customer access to senior decision makers. It competes for deposits by offering depositors a wide variety of account types, convenient office locations and competitive rates. Other services offered include tax deferred retirement programs, brokerage services through an affiliation with Community Wealth Advisors, cash management services and safe deposit boxes. The Bank has used targeted direct mail, print and online advertising and community outreach to increase its market share of deposits, loans and other services in its market area. It provides ongoing training for its staff in an attempt to ensure high-quality service.
Lending Activities
 General
 The Bank offers a wide variety of real estate and commercial loans. The Bank’s lending activities include commercial real estate loans, loans secured by residential rental property, construction loans, land acquisition and development loans, equipment financing, commercial and consumer loans. The Company exited the origination of owner-occupied residential mortgages in April 2015 and has established third party sources to supply its residential whole loan portfolio. Most of the Bank’s customers are residents of or businesses located in the Bank’s market area. The Bank’s primary targets for commercial loans consist of small and medium-sized businesses with revenues of $5.0 million to $35.0 million as well as local municipal agencies and not-for-profits in Southern Maryland, the Annapolis area of Maryland and the greater Fredericksburg area of Virginia.

Commercial Real Estate (CRE) and Other Non-Residential Real Estate Loans
 The permanent financing of commercial and other improved real estate projects, including office buildings, retail locations, churches, and other special purpose buildings, is the largest component of the Bank’s loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans amounted to $667.1 million or 61.3% of the loan portfolio and $538.9 million or 58.6% of the loan portfolio, respectively at December 31, 2016 and 2015. This portfolio has increased in both absolute size and as a percentage of the loan portfolio in each of the last five years. The CRE portfolio includes commercial construction balances. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, commercial construction balances were 9.3% and 6.1% of the CRE portfolio.
 
The primary security on a commercial real estate loan is the real property and the leases or businesses that produce income for the real property. The Bank generally limits its exposure to a single borrower to 15% of the Bank’s capital and participates with other lenders on larger projects. Loans secured by commercial real estate are generally limited to 80% of the lower of the appraised value or sales price and have an initial contractual loan amortization period ranging from three to 20 years. Interest rates and payments on these loans typically adjust after an initial fixed-rate period, which is generally between three and ten years. Interest rates and payments on adjustable-rate loans are adjusted to a rate based on the United States Treasury Bill Index. Almost all of the Bank’s commercial real estate loans are secured by real estate located in the Bank’s primary market area. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the largest outstanding commercial real estate loans were $12.8 million and $9.7 million, respectively, which were secured by commercial real estate and performing according to its terms.
 
Loans secured by commercial real estate are larger and involve greater risks than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by such properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. As a result of the greater emphasis that the Bank places on increasing its portfolio of commercial real estate loans, the Bank is increasingly exposed to the risks posed by this type of lending. To monitor cash flows on income properties, the Bank requires borrowers and loan guarantors, if any, to provide annual financial statements on multi-family or commercial real estate loans. In reaching a decision on whether to make a multi-family or commercial real estate loan, the Bank considers the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability, and the value of the underlying property, as well as the borrower’s global cash flows.
 
If a determination is made that there is a potential environmental hazard, the Bank will complete an Environmental Assessment Checklist. If this checklist or the appraisal indicates potential issues, a Phase 1 environmental survey will generally be required.
 
Residential First Mortgage Loans
 Residential first mortgage loans are generally long-term loans, amortized on a monthly or bi-weekly basis, with principal and interest due each payment. These loans are secured by owner-occupied single-family homes. The initial contractual loan payment period for residential loans typically ranges from ten to 30 years. The Bank’s experience indicates that residential real estate loans remain outstanding for significantly shorter time periods than their contractual terms. Borrowers may refinance or prepay loans at their option, without penalty.
 
The Company stopped underwriting owner-occupied residential first mortgages in April 2015 and established third party sources to fund its residential whole loan portfolio. The third party sources allow the Company to maintain a well-diversified residential portfolio while addressing the credit needs of the communities in its footprint. The Bank’s practice has been to purchase individual residential first mortgage loans as well as purchase the right to service the loans acquired.
 
Total fixed-rate loans in our residential first mortgage portfolio amounted to $125.4 million and $112.5 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Fixed-rate loans may be packaged and sold to investors or retained in the Bank’s loan portfolio. The Bank generally retains the right to service loans sold for a payment based upon a percentage (generally 0.25% of the outstanding loan balance). As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bank serviced $52.0 million and $63.0 million, respectively, in residential mortgage loans for others.
 
Adjustable mortgages are generally adjustable on a one-, three- and five-year terms with limitations on upward adjustments per re-pricing period and an upward cap over the life of the loan. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bank had $45.6 million and $18.9 million, respectively, in adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the largest outstanding residential first mortgage loans were $2.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, which were secured by residences located in the Bank’s market area. The loans were performing according to terms.
 
3


Residential first mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80% generally carry private mortgage insurance to lower the Bank’s exposure to approximately 80% of the value of the property. The Bank had fewer than 10 loans with private mortgage insurance at December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 
All improved real estate that serves as security for a loan made by the Bank must be insured, in the amount and by such companies as may be approved by the Bank, against fire, vandalism, malicious mischief and other hazards. Such insurance must be maintained through the entire term of the loan and in an amount not less than that amount necessary to pay the Bank’s indebtedness in full.
 
Longer-term fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans are subject to greater interest-rate risk due to term and annual and lifetime limitations on interest rate adjustments that limit the increases in interest rates on these loans. There are also credit risks resulting from potential increased costs to the borrower as a result of repricing of adjustable-rate mortgage loans. During periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on adjustable-rate mortgage loans may increase due to the upward adjustment of interest cost to the borrower.
 
Residential Rentals
 Residential rental mortgage loans are amortizing, with principal and interest due each month. These loans are non-owner occupied and secured by income-producing 1-4 family units and apartments. The Bank originates both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential rental first mortgages. Loans secured by residential rental properties are generally limited to 80% of the lower of the appraised value or sales price at origination and have an initial contractual loan payment period ranging from three to 20 years. The primary security on a residential rental loan is the property and the leases that produce income.
 
Total fixed-rate loans in our residential rental first mortgage portfolio amounted to $17.9 million and $17.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bank had $83.9 million and $75.9 million, respectively, in adjustable-rate residential rental mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, $84.9 million and $80.8 million, respectively, were 1-4 family units and $17.0 million and $12.4 million, respectively, were apartment buildings.
 
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the largest outstanding residential rental mortgage loan was $10.5 million and $10.8 million, respectively, which was secured by over 120 single family homes located in the Bank’s market area. The loan was performing according to its terms at December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 
Loans secured by residential rental properties involve greater risks than 1-4 family residential mortgage loans. Although, there are similar risk characteristics shared with commercial real estate loans, the balances for the loans secured by residential rental properties are generally smaller. Because payments on loans secured by residential rental properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of these loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the rental real estate market or the economy than similar owner occupied properties.
 
Construction and Land Development Loans
 The Bank offers construction loans for the construction of one- to four-family dwellings to home builders. Construction loans totaled $12.1 million and $14.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Generally, these loans are secured by the real estate under construction as well as by guarantees of the principals involved. Draws are made upon satisfactory completion of predefined stages of construction. The Bank will typically lend up to 80% of the lower of appraised value or the contract purchase price of the homes to be constructed. In addition, the Bank offers loans to acquire and develop land, as well as loans on undeveloped, subdivided lots for home building by individuals. Land acquisition and development loans totaled $24.9 million and $22.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Bank policy requires that zoning and permits must be in place prior to making development loans. The Bank will typically lend up to the lower of 75% of the appraised value or cost. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the largest outstanding construction and land development loan was $4.9 million, which was secured by land in the Bank’s market area.
 
The Bank’s ability to originate residential construction and development loans is heavily dependent on the continued demand for single-family housing construction in the Bank’s market area. The Bank’s investment in these loans has declined in recent years. Construction and land development loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio have been decreasing since 2008 from greater than 10% as of December 31, 2008 to 3.4% at December 31, 2016. If the demand for new houses being built from smaller builders in the Bank’s market areas continues to decline, this portion of the loan portfolio may continue to decline. In addition, a decline in demand for new housing might adversely affect the ability of borrowers to repay these loans.

Construction and land development loans are inherently riskier than providing financing on owner-occupied real estate. The Bank’s risk of loss is affected by the accuracy of the initial estimate of the market value of the completed project as well as the accuracy of the cost estimates made to complete the project. In addition, the volatility of the real estate market has made it increasingly difficult to ensure that the valuation of land associated with these loans is accurate. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the development. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be confronted, at or before the maturity of the loan, with a project having a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment. As a result of these factors, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If the Bank forecloses on a project, the Bank may not be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs.
 
Home Equity and Second Mortgage Loans
 The Bank maintains a portfolio of home equity and second mortgage loans. Home equity loans, which totaled $19.7 million and $19.5 million, respectively at December 31, 2016 and 2015, are generally made in the form of lines of credit with minimum amounts of $5,000, have terms of up to 20 years, variable rates priced at the then current Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a margin, and require an 80% or 90% loan-to-value ratio (including any prior liens), depending on the specific loan program. Second mortgage loans, which totaled $1.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively at December 31, 2016 and 2015, are fixed or variable-rate loans that have original terms between five and 15 years. These products contain a higher risk of default than residential first mortgages as in the event of foreclosure, the first mortgage would need to be paid off prior to collection of the second mortgage. This risk has been heightened as the market value of residential property has declined.
Commercial Loans
 The Bank offers commercial loans to its business customers. The Bank offers a variety of commercial loan products including term loans and lines of credit. The portfolio consists primarily of demand loans and lines of credit. Such loans can be made for terms of up to five years. However, most of the loans are originated for a term of two years or less. The Bank offers both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans (typically tied to the then current Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a margin with a floor) under these product lines. Commercial loans remain an important class of the Bank’s loan portfolio, but have decreased as a percentage of total loans and in total dollars over the last few years. At $50.5 million and 4.6% of total loans and $67.2 million and 7.3% of total loans at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the commercial loan portfolio decreased by $16.7 million and $6.4 million compared to the prior year end balance.
 
When making commercial business loans, the Bank considers the financial condition of the borrower, the borrower’s payment history of both corporate and personal debt, the projected cash flows of the business as well the borrower’s global cash flows, the viability of the industry in which the borrower operates, the value of the collateral, and the borrower’s ability to service the debt. These loans are primarily secured by equipment, real property, accounts receivable or other security as determined by the Bank. The higher interest rates and shorter loan terms available on commercial lending make these products attractive to the Bank.
 
Commercial business loans, however, entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial loans are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flows of the borrower’s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. In the case of business failure, collateral would need to be liquidated to provide repayment for the loan. In many cases, the highly specialized nature of collateral would make full recovery from the sale of collateral problematic. The Bank attempts to control these risks by establishing guidelines that provide for loans with low loan-to-value ratios. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the largest outstanding commercial loans were $4.0 million and $12.0 million, respectively, which was secured by commercial real estate (all of which was located in the Bank’s market area), cash and investments. These loans were performing according to terms at December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Consumer Loans
 The Bank has consumer loans secured by automobiles, boats, recreational vehicles and trucks. The Bank also makes home improvement loans and offers both secured and unsecured personal lines of credit. Consumer loans totaled $422,000 and $366,000, respectively, at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Consumer loans entail greater risk from other loan types due to being secured by rapidly depreciating assets or the reliance on the borrower’s continuing financial stability.
Commercial Equipment Loans
 The Bank also maintains an amortizing commercial portfolio consisting primarily of commercial equipment loans. Commercial equipment loans totaled $39.7 million and $29.9 million, or 3.7% and 3.3% of the total loan portfolio, respectively, at December 31, 2016 and 2015. These loans consist primarily of fixed-rate, short-term loans collateralized by customers’ equipment including trucks, cars, construction and other more specialized equipment. When making commercial equipment loans, the Bank considers the same factors it considers when underwriting a commercial business loan. The higher interest rates and shorter loan terms available on commercial equipment lending make these products attractive to the Bank. These loans entail greater risk than loans such as residential mortgage loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flows of the borrower’s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. In the case of business failure, collateral would need to be liquidated to provide repayment for the loan. In many cases, the highly specialized nature of collateral equipment would make full recovery from the sale of collateral problematic. The Bank assesses the amount of collateral required for a loan based upon the credit worthiness of the borrowers.

(1) Loans secured by residential rental property were included in the residential first mortgage and commercial real estate loan portfolios prior to a reclassification in 2016. See Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Comparative financial information was reclassified to conform to the classification presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements at and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
 
(2) Includes both commercial loans and commercial equipment loans.
 
Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales
 The Bank solicits loan applications through marketing by commercial loan officers, its branch network, and referrals from customers. Loans are processed and approved according to guidelines established by the Bank. Loan requirements such as income verification, collateral appraisal, and credit reports vary by loan type. Additionally, residential mortgages are purchased from third party providers after reviewing loan documents, underwriting support, and completing other procedures, as necessary. Loan processing functions are generally centralized except for small consumer loans. Depending on market conditions, residential mortgage loans may be classified with the intent to sell to third parties such as FHLMC. The Company sold no residential mortgage loans for the year ended December 31, 2016. Residential mortgage loans in the amounts of $4.2 million and $13.6 million were sold by the Bank for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
To comply with internal and regulatory limits on loans to one borrower, the Bank may sell portions of commercial and commercial real estate loans to other lenders. The Bank sold CRE participations of $3.0 million in 2016 and $1.5 million in 2015. The Bank may also buy loans, portions of loans, or participation certificates from other lenders. The Bank only purchases loans or portions of loans after reviewing loan documents, underwriting support, and completing other procedures, as necessary. The Bank purchased no commercial real estate or commercial loans during 2016 and 2015. Purchased participation loans are subject to the same regulatory and internal policy requirements as other loans in the Bank’s portfolio as described below.

Loan Approvals, Procedures and Authority
 Loan approval authority is established by Board policy. The Officer’s Loan Committee (OLC) consists of the following members of the Bank’s executive management; the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), President and Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”), Chief Operating Officer (“COO”) and the Chief Lending Officer (“CLO”). In addition, the OLC includes the Senior Credit Officer (“SCO”) and Senior Loan Officers (“SLO’s”). The OLC must have three (3) members of Executive Management approve all loans presented above individual loan authorities granted to the SCO and the SLOs. The SCO and the SLOs have been granted individual loan authority up to $1.0 million. Loan approval authorities vary by individual. The individual lending authority of the other lenders is set by management and is based on their individual abilities.
 
All loans and loan relationships that exceed the Bank’s in-house lending limit are required to be approved by at least three (3) members of the Bank’s Credit Risk Committee (“CRC”). In addition, the Board of Directors or the CRC approve all loans required to be approved by regulation, such as Regulation O loans or commercial loans to employees. The in-house lending guideline is approved by the Board on an annual basis or as needed if more frequently and is less than the Bank’s legal lending limit.
 
The Credit Risk Committee of the Board, consisting of three or more directors, has been delegated by the Board of Directors of the Bank to assist the Board in its oversight responsibilities. The Committee reviews the Bank’s credit risk management, including the significant policies, procedures and practices employed to manage credit risk, and provides recommendations to the Board and strategic guidance to management on the assumption, management and mitigation of credit risk.
 
Depending on the loan and collateral type, conditions for protecting the Bank’s collateral are specified in the loan documents. Typically these conditions might include requirements to maintain hazard and title insurance and to pay property taxes.
 
Loans to One Borrower
 Under Maryland law, the maximum amount that the Bank is permitted to lend to any one borrower and his or her related interests may generally not exceed 10% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus, which is defined to include the Bank’s capital, surplus, retained earnings and 50% of its reserve for possible loan losses. Under this authority, the Bank would have been permitted to lend up to $14.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively, to any one borrower at December 31, 2016 and 2015. By interpretive ruling of the Maryland Commissioner, Maryland banks have the option of lending up to the amount that would be permissible for a national bank, which is generally 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus (defined to include a bank’s total capital for regulatory capital purposes plus any loan loss allowances not included in regulatory capital). Under this formula, the Bank would have been permitted to lend up to $21.9 million and $21.2 million, respectively, to any one borrower at December 31, 2016 and 2015. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the largest amount outstanding to any one borrower and borrower’s related interests was $12.8 million and $12.0 million, respectively.
Loan Commitments
 The Bank does not normally negotiate standby commitments for the construction and purchase of real estate. Most loan commitments are granted for a one-month period. The Bank’s outstanding commitments to originate loans at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $67.0 million and $73.5 million, respectively, excluding undisbursed portions of loans in process. It has been the Bank’s experience that few commitments expire unfunded.
Maturity of Loan Portfolio
 See Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the dollar amount of loans maturing in the Bank’s portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Demand loans, loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity, and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less.
Asset Classification
 Federal regulations and our policies require that we utilize an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting on asset quality. We use an internal asset classification system, substantially consistent with Federal banking regulations, as a part of our credit monitoring system. Federal banking regulations set forth a classification scheme for problem and potential problem assets as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” assets. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are required to be designated “special mention.”
 
8


When an insured institution classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as “substandard” or “doubtful,” it is required that a general valuation allowance for loan losses be established in an amount deemed prudent by management. General valuation allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but that, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount.
 
The table below sets forth information on our classified assets and assets designated special mention at the dates indicated. Classified and special mention assets include loans, securities and other real estate owned.

Delinquencies
 The Bank’s collection procedures provide that when a loan is 15 days delinquent, the borrower is contacted by mail and payment is requested. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts will be made to contact the delinquent borrower and obtain payment. If these efforts prove unsuccessful, the Bank will pursue appropriate legal action including repossession of the collateral and other actions as deemed necessary. In certain instances, the Bank will attempt to modify the loan or grant a limited moratorium on loan payments to enable the borrower to reorganize borrower’s financial affairs. For an analysis of past due loans as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, refer to Note 6 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Impaired Loans
 A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The Bank evaluates substandard and doubtful classified loans, loans delinquent 90 days or greater, non-accrual loans and troubled debt restructures (“TDRs”) on an individualized basis to determine whether a loan is impaired (See Notes 1 and 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements).
 
Factors considered by management in determining impaired status include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the circumstances surrounding the loan. These circumstances include the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Loans not impaired are included in the pool of loans evaluated in the general component of the allowance.
 
If a specific loan is deemed to be impaired it is evaluated for impairment. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. For loans that have an impairment, a specific allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than carrying value of that loan.
 
9


The Bank considers all TDRs to be impaired and defines TDRs as loans whose terms have been modified to provide for a reduction or a delay in the payment of either interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower. A loan extended or renewed at a stated interest rate equal to the current interest rate for new debt with similar risk is not considered a TDR. Once an obligation has been classified as a TDR it continues to be considered a TDR until paid in full or until the debt is refinanced at market rates with no debt forgiveness. TDRs are evaluated for impairment on a loan-by-loan basis in accordance with the Bank’s impairment methodology. The Bank does not participate in any specific government or Bank-sponsored loan modification programs. All restructured loan agreements are individual contracts negotiated with a borrower.
 
Specific loan loss reserves of $1.3 million and $1.6 million, respectively, related to impaired loans at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The following table sets forth information with respect to the Bank’s impaired loans at the dates indicated. The table includes a breakdown between impaired loans with and without an allowance:

For additional information regarding impaired loans by class at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, refer to Note 6 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
The Bank closely monitors the payment activity of all its loans. The Bank periodically reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on an analysis of the size of and composition of the loan portfolio, the Bank’s historical loss experience, including trends in delinquency, non-performing and classified loans and charge-offs, economic conditions in the Bank’s market area, and a review of selected individual loans. Loan losses are charged off against the allowance when individual loans are deemed uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The Bank believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and is in compliance with appropriate regulatory guidelines. However, the establishment of the level of the allowance for loan losses is highly subjective and dependent on incomplete information as to the ultimate disposition of loans. Accordingly, actual losses may vary from the amounts estimated. Additionally, our regulators as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses, thereby affecting the Bank’s financial condition and earnings. For a more complete discussion of the allowance for loan losses, see the section captioned “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies” and Notes 1 and 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non-performing Assets
 The Bank’s non-performing assets include other real estate owned, non-accrual loans and TDRs. Both non-accrual and TDR loans include loans that are paid current and are performing in accordance with the term of their original or modified contract terms. For a detailed discussion on asset quality see the section captioned “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Asset Quality.”
 
Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”)
 Real estate acquired by the Bank as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as foreclosed real estate until such time as it is sold. When such property is acquired, it is recorded at its estimated fair value. Subsequent to foreclosure, the property is carried at the lower of cost or fair value less selling costs. Additional write-downs as well as carrying expenses of the foreclosed properties are charged to expenses in the current period. The Bank had foreclosed real estate with a carrying value of approximately $7.8 million and $9.4 million, respectively at December 31, 2016 and 2015. For a discussion of the accounting for foreclosed real estate, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Other Real Estate Owned” and Notes 1 and 8 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
12


Non-accrual Loans
 Loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed on non-accrual status when, in the opinion of management, the collection of additional interest is doubtful. The accrual of interest on mortgage and commercial loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent unless the credit is well secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged-off no later than 90 days past due. In all cases, loans are placed on non-accrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Non-accrual loans are evaluated for impaired status on a loan by loan basis in accordance with the Company’s impairment methodology.
 
All interest accrued but not collected from loans that are placed on non-accrual or charged-off is reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual status. Loans are returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. Non-accrual loans include certain loans that are current with all loan payments and are placed on non-accrual status due to customer operating results and cash flows. Interest is recognized on non-accrual loans on a cash-basis if the loans are not impaired or there is no impairment. For a discussion of the accounting for non-accrual loans, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Asset Quality” and Notes 1 and 6 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investment Activities
 The Bank maintains a portfolio of investment securities to provide liquidity as well as a source of earnings. The Bank’s investment securities portfolio consists primarily of asset-backed mortgage-backed (“MBS”) and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) and other securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”), including FNMA and FHLMC. The Bank also has smaller holdings of privately issued mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasury obligations, and other equity and debt securities. The Bank is required to maintain investments in the Federal Home Loan Bank based upon levels of borrowings.
 
The following table sets forth the carrying value of the Company’s investment securities portfolio and FHLB of Atlanta and Federal Reserve Bank stock at the dates indicated. HTM securities and FHLB of Atlanta and Federal Reserve Bank stock are carried at amortized cost and AFS securities are carried at fair value. At December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, their estimated fair value was $168.3 million, $151.4 million, $133.3 million, $139.9 million and $166.9 million, respectively. As previously disclosed, on April 18, 2016, the Bank terminated its membership in the Federal Reserve System and cancelled its stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond effective as of that date.

The Bank’s investment policy provides that securities that will be held for indefinite periods of time, including securities that will be used as part of the Bank’s asset/liability management strategy and that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, prepayments and similar factors are classified as available for sale and accounted for at fair value. Management’s intent is to hold securities reported at amortized cost to maturity. Certain of the Company’s asset-backed securities are issued by private issuers (defined as an issuer that is not a government or a government-sponsored entity). The Company had no investments in any private issuer’s securities that aggregate to more than 10% of the Company’s equity. For a discussion of investments see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Asset Quality” and Notes 1 and 5 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Borrowings
 Deposits are the primary source of funds for the Bank’s lending and investment activities and for its general business purposes. The Bank uses advances from the FHLB of Atlanta to supplement the supply of funds it may lend and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. Advances from the FHLB are secured by the Bank’s stock in the FHLB, a portion of the Bank’s loan portfolio and certain investments. Generally, the Bank’s ability to borrow from the FHLB of Atlanta is limited by its available collateral and also by an overall limitation of 30% of assets. Further, short-term credit facilities are available at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and commercial banks. Long-term debt consists of adjustable-rate advances with rates based upon LIBOR, fixed-rate advances, and convertible advances. For a discussion of borrowing, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liabilities” and Notes 1, 11, 16 and 17 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Subsidiary Activities
 In April 1997, the Bank formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Community Mortgage Corporation of Tri-County, to offer mortgage banking, brokerage, and other services to the public. This corporation is currently inactive. The Company has two direct subsidiaries other than the Bank. In July 2004, Tri-County Capital Trust I was established as a statutory trust under Delaware law as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to issue trust preferred securities. Tri-County Capital Trust I issued $7.0 million of trust preferred securities on July 22, 2004. In June 2005, Tri-County Capital Trust II was also established as a statutory trust under Delaware law as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to issue trust preferred securities. Tri-County Capital Trust II issued $5.0 million of trust preferred securities on June 15, 2005. For more information regarding these entities, see Note 16 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Supervision and Regulation
 
Regulation of the Company
 
General
 As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to comprehensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), and the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders, and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.
 
The following discussion summarizes certain of the regulations applicable to the Company but does not purport to be a complete description of such regulations and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations involved.
 
Acquisition of Control
 A bank holding company, with certain exceptions, must obtain Federal Reserve Board approval before (1) acquiring ownership or control of another bank or bank holding company if it would own or control more than 5% of such shares or (2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (3) merging with another bank holding company. In evaluating such application, the Federal Reserve Board considers factors such as the financial condition and managerial resources of the companies involved, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and competitive factors. Federal law provides that no person may acquire “control” of a bank holding company or insured bank without the approval of the appropriate federal regulator. Control is defined to mean direct or indirect ownership, control of 25% or more of any class of voting stock, control of the election of a majority of the bank’s directors or a determination by the Federal Reserve Board that the acquirer has or would have the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution.
 
The Maryland Financial Institutions Code additionally prohibits any person from acquiring more than 10% of the outstanding shares of any class of securities of a bank or bank holding company, or electing a majority of the directors or directing the management or policies of any such entity, without 60 days prior notice to the Commissioner. The Commissioner may deny approval of the acquisition if the Commissioner determines it to be anti-competitive or to threaten the safety or soundness of a banking institution.
 
Permissible Activities
 A bank holding company is limited in its activities to banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. Other permitted non-bank activities have been identified as closely related to banking. Bank holding companies that are “well capitalized” and “well managed” and whose financial institution subsidiaries have satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act records can elect to become “financial holding companies,” which are permitted to engage in a broader range of financial activities than are permitted to bank holding companies. The Company has not opted to become a financial holding company.
 
The Federal Reserve Board has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity, or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company.
 
Dividend
 The Federal Reserve Board has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve Board’s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company’s bank subsidiary is classified as “undercapitalized.” See “Regulation of the Bank – Capital Adequacy.”
 
19


Sources of Strength
 The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine requiring bank holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository subsidiaries, by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. The regulatory agencies are required, under the Act, to issue implementing regulations.
Stock Repurchases
 The Company is required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption. This requirement does not apply to bank holding companies that are “well capitalized,” “well-managed” and are not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues.
Capital Requirement
 Bank holding companies are required to maintain on a consolidated basis, specified minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. These requirements, which generally apply to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $1 billion or more, such as the Company, are substantially similar to, but somewhat more generous than, those applicable to the Bank. See “– Regulation of the Bank – Capital Adequacy.” The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to adopt consolidated capital requirements for holding companies that are equally as stringent as those applicable to the depository institution subsidiaries. That means that certain instruments that had previously been includable in Tier 1 capital for bank holding companies, such as trust preferred securities, will no longer be eligible for inclusion. The revised capital requirements are subject to certain grandfathering and transition rules. The Company is currently considered a grandfathered institution under these rules.
 
Regulation of the Bank
 
General
 The Bank is a Maryland commercial bank and its deposit accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. On April 18, 2016, the Bank terminated its membership in the Federal Reserve System and cancelled its stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. Accordingly, as of that date, the Bank’s primary regulator became the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The Bank currently is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by Commissioner of Financial Regulation of the State of Maryland (the “Commissioner”) and the FDIC.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau assumed responsibility for implementing federal consumer financial protection and fair lending laws and regulations, a function currently handled by federal bank regulatory agencies. However, institutions of less than $10 billion, such as the Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection or fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to enforcement authority of their primary federal regulators.
 
The following discussion summarizes certain regulations applicable to the Bank but does not purport to be a complete description of such regulations and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations involved.
 
Capital Adequacy
 On July 9, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revised their risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Basel III Capital Rules”).
 
On January 1, 2015, the Company and Bank became subject to the Basel III Capital Rules with full compliance with all of the final rules’ requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule, to be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019. The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions compared to the previous U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel III Capital Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing risk-weighting approach with a more risk-sensitive approach. The Basel III Capital Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies’ rules.
 
20


The Basel III Capital Rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5%, raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0%, require a minimum ratio (“Min. Ratio”) of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, and require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. A new capital conservation buffer (“CCB”) is also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements. This capital conservation buffer began being phased-in January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increases each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching its final level of 2.5% on January 1, 2019. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented under the final rules. The final rules also revise the definition and calculation of Tier 1 capital, total capital, and risk-weighted assets.
 
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action
 Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For such purposes, the law establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.
 
As a result of the Basel III Capital Rules (discussed further above), effective January 1, 2015, an institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, and a leverage capital ratio of 5% or greater, and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An institution is deemed to be “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater and generally a leverage capital ratio of 4% or greater. An institution is deemed to be “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5% or generally a leverage capital ratio of less than 4%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or a leverage capital ratio of less than 3%. An institution is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.
 
“Undercapitalized” institutions are subject to growth, capital distribution (including dividend), and other limitations, and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. An institution’s compliance with such a plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the bank’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” Significantly undercapitalized institutions are subject to one or more additional restrictions including, but not limited to, a regulatory order requiring them to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized; requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, or dismiss directors or officers; and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers, and capital distributions by the parent holding company.
 
Beginning 60 days after becoming “critically undercapitalized,” critically undercapitalized institutions also may not make any payment of principal or interest on certain subordinated debt, extend credit for a highly leveraged transaction, or enter into any material transaction outside the ordinary course of business. In addition, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver is required for a critically undercapitalized institution within 270 days after it obtains such status.
 
Branching
 Maryland law provides that, with the approval of the Commissioner, Maryland banks may establish branches within Maryland and may establish branches in other states by any means permitted by the laws of such state or by federal law. The FDIC may approve interstate branching by merger in any state that did not opt out and de novo in states that specifically allow for such branching.
 
Dividend Limitations
 Maryland banks may only pay cash dividends from undivided profits or, with the prior approval of the Commissioner, their surplus in excess of 100% of required capital stock. Maryland banks may not declare a stock dividend unless their surplus, after the increase in capital stock, is equal to at least 20% of the outstanding capital stock as increased. If the surplus of the bank, after the increase in capital stock, is less than 100% of its capital stock as increased, the commercial bank must annually transfer to surplus at least 10% of its net earnings until the surplus is 100% of its capital stock as increased.

Insurance of Deposit Accounts
 The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. The deposit insurance per account owner is currently $250,000.
 
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned. The initial base assessment rate ranges from five to 35 basis points. The rate schedules will automatically adjust in the future when the Deposit Insurance Fund reaches certain milestones. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment.
 
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or its prudential banking regulator. The management of the Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.
 
Reserve Requirements
 Under federal regulations, the Bank is required to maintain non-interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) and regular checking accounts). The regulations required that that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows for 2016: a 3% reserve ratio was assessed on net transaction accounts up to and including $110.2 million; a 10% reserve ratio is applied above $110.2 million. The first $15.2 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements. The amounts are adjusted annually and, for 2017, will require a 3% ratio for up to $115.1 million and an exemption of $15.5 million. At December 31, 2016, the Bank met applicable reserve requirements.
Transactions with Affiliates
 A state nonmember bank, such as the Bank, is limited in the amount of “covered transactions” with any affiliate. All such transactions must also be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the Bank or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and similar types of transactions. Certain covered transactions, such as loans to affiliates, must meet collateral requirements. At December 31, 2016, we had no transactions with affiliates.
 
Loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders of a state nonmember bank must be made on substantially the same terms as those prevailing for comparable transactions with persons who are not executive officers, directors, principal stockholders or employees of the bank. Loans to any executive officer, director and principal stockholder together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests generally may not exceed 15% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus and all loans to such persons may not exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates, in excess of the greater of $25,000 or 5% of capital and surplus, or any loans cumulatively aggregating $500,000 or more, must be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank with any “interested” director not participating in the voting. State nonmember banks are prohibited from paying the overdrafts of any of their executive officers or directors unless payment is made pursuant to a written, pre-authorized interest-bearing extension of credit plan that specifies a method of repayment or transfer of funds from another account at the bank. In addition, loans to executive officers may not be made on terms more favorable than those afforded other borrowers and are restricted as to type, amount and terms of credit.
 
Enforcement
 The Commissioner has extensive enforcement authority over Maryland banks. Such authority includes the ability to issue cease and desist orders and civil money penalties and to remove directors or officers. The Commissioner may also take possession of a Maryland bank whose capital is impaired and seek to have a receiver appointed by a court.
 
The FDIC has primary federal enforcement responsibility over state banks under its jurisdiction, including the authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-related parties,” including stockholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of capital directive or a cease and desist order for the removal of officers and/or directors, receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance. Civil money penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day or even up to $1 million per day (in the most egregious cases). Criminal penalties for most financial institution crimes include fines of up to $1 million and imprisonment for up to 30 years.
