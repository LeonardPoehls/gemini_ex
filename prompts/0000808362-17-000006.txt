ABOUT BAKER HUGHES
Baker Hughes is a leading supplier of oilfield services, products, technology and systems used in the worldwide oil and natural gas industry. We also provide products and services for other businesses including downstream chemicals, and process and pipeline services. Baker Hughes was formed as a corporation in April 1987 in connection with the combination of Baker International Corporation and Hughes Tool Company. We conduct our operations through subsidiaries, affiliates, ventures and alliances. We conduct business in more than 80 countries around the world and our corporate headquarters is in Houston, Texas. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 33,000 employees, of which approximately 64% work outside the United States (the "U.S.").
Our global oilfield operations are organized into a number of geomarket organizations, which are combined into four regions for assessing performance and allocating resources. The President of Global Operations manages our oilfield organization and reports to our chief executive officer. These regions form the basis of our four geographical operating segments as follows: North America; Latin America; Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian; and Middle East/Asia Pacific.
2

Through the geographic organization, our management is located close to our customers, facilitating strong customer relationships and allowing us to react quickly to local market conditions and customer needs. The geographic organization supports our oilfield operations and is responsible for sales, field operations and well site execution. In addition to the above, we have an Industrial Services segment, which includes the downstream chemicals business and the process and pipeline services business.
Certain support operations are organized at the enterprise level and include the supply chain and product line technology organizations. The supply chain organization is responsible for the cost-effective procurement and manufacturing of our products as well as product quality and reliability. The product line technology organization is responsible for innovating, developing, commercializing, and marketing reliable products designed to advance the performance of reservoirs for our customers. The product line technology organization also facilitates the development of cross-product line solutions, sales processes and integrated operations capabilities.
Further information about our segments is set forth in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 6. "Segment Information" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.
HALLIBURTON TERMINATED MERGER AGREEMENT
On November 16, 2014, Baker Hughes and Halliburton Company ("Halliburton") entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement") under which Halliburton would acquire all outstanding shares of Baker Hughes in a stock and cash transaction (the "Merger"). In accordance with the provisions of Section 9.1 of the Merger Agreement, Baker Hughes and Halliburton agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement on April 30, 2016, as a result of the failure of the Merger to occur on or before April 30, 2016 due to the inability to obtain certain specified antitrust related approvals. Halliburton paid $3.5 billion to Baker Hughes on May 4, 2016, representing the antitrust termination fee required to be paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement. For further information about the Merger, see Note 2. "Halliburton Terminated Merger Agreement" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.
GENERAL ELECTRIC TRANSACTION AGREEMENT
On October 30, 2016, Baker Hughes, General Electric Company ("GE"), Bear Newco, Inc. ("Newco"), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Baker Hughes, and Bear MergerSub, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Newco, entered into a Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Transaction Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Baker Hughes, with Baker Hughes as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Entity") and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Newco. As a result of the merger, each outstanding share of the Baker Hughes' common stock will be converted into the right to receive one share of Class A common stock of Newco ("Newco Class A Common Stock"). Immediately following the merger, Newco will cause the Surviving Entity to be converted into a Delaware limited liability company ("Newco LLC") and Newco will become the sole managing member of Newco LLC. Following this conversion, GE will receive an approximate 62.5% membership interest in Newco LLC in exchange for contributing $7.4 billion (less the Class B Purchase Price, as defined below) in cash and GE's oil and gas business ("GE O&G") to Newco LLC, and will also receive Class B common stock of Newco (the "Newco Class B Common Stock"), representing approximately 62.5% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock of Newco, in exchange for contributing the par value thereof (the "Class B Purchase Price") to Newco. Newco will distribute as a special dividend an amount equal to $17.50 per share to the holders of record of the Newco Class A Common Stock, which are the former Baker Hughes stockholders. Newco will operate as a public company.
Immediately following the closing (the "Closing") of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement (collectively the "GE Transaction"), GE will hold 100% of the Newco Class B Common Stock, which will represent approximately 62.5% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock of Newco, and Baker Hughes' stockholders immediately prior to the Closing will hold 100% of the Newco Class A Common Stock, which will represent approximately 37.5% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock of Newco. In addition, GE will hold an approximate 62.5% membership interest in Newco LLC and Newco will hold an approximate 37.5% membership interest in Newco LLC. The membership interests in Newco LLC, together with the Newco Class B Common Stock, will be exchangeable on a 1:1 basis for Newco Class A Common Stock, subject to certain adjustments. The rights (including voting rights) of Newco Class A Common Stock and Newco Class B 
3

Common Stock are identical; provided that Newco Class B Common Stock has no economic rights. Effective from and following the Closing, Newco and its subsidiaries will operate under the name "Baker Hughes, a GE Company."
The GE Transaction is subject to the approval of Baker Hughes' stockholders, regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Baker Hughes and GE expect the GE Transaction to close in mid-2017. However, Baker Hughes cannot predict with certainty when, or if, the GE Transaction will be completed because completion of the GE Transaction is subject to conditions beyond the control of Baker Hughes. For further information about the GE Transaction, see Note 3. "General Electric Transaction Agreement" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
Oilfield Operations
We offer a full suite of products and services to our customers around the world. Our oilfield products and services fall into one of two categories, Drilling and Evaluation or Completion and Production. This classification is based on the two major phases of constructing an oil and/or natural gas well, the drilling phase and the completion phase, and how our products and services are utilized for each phase.
Drilling and Evaluation products and services consist of the following:

• | Drill Bits - Includes Tricone™ roller cone drill bits, polycrystalline diamond composite (PDC or "diamond" drill bits, Kymera™ hybrid drill bits and related cutter technology used for performance drilling, hole enlargement and coring.


• | Drilling Services - Includes directional drilling systems and services (rotary steerables, drilling motors, measurement-while-drilling (MWD) systems, etc.), logging-while-drilling (LWD) systems and services (resistivity, imaging, pressure testing and sampling, etc.), surface logging and coring systems and services, and geoscience services.


• | Wireline Services - Includes both open hole (imaging, fluids sampling, etc.) and cased hole (production logging, wellbore integrity, pipe recovery, etc.) well logging services.


• | Drilling and Completion Fluids - Includes emulsion (oil-based) and water-based drilling fluids systems; reservoir drill-in fluids; completion fluids, and fluids environmental services.

Completion and Production products and services consist of the following:

• | Completion Systems - Includes products and services used to control the flow of hydrocarbons within a wellbore including upper completions (packers, liner hangers, safety systems, etc.), lower completions (sand screens, tubing conveyed perforating, etc.) and unconventional multistage completion systems (frac plugs, frac balls, etc.).


• | Intelligent Production Systems - Includes products, services, and software used to monitor, analyze, and dynamically control production to optimize returns and ultimate recovery (production decisions services, chemical injection service, well monitoring services, intelligent well systems, and artificial lift monitoring).


• | Wellbore Intervention - Includes products and services used to intervene in existing wellbores to improve production and solve problems within the well (fishing services, wellbore cleanup, casing exit systems, workover systems, smart interventional technologies, and through-tubing intervention tools).


• | Artificial Lift - Includes products and services used to maintain production, improve recovery rates, and lower operating costs in wells in which a reservoir can no longer flow naturally (in-well electric submersible pumping systems; progressing cavity pump systems; gas lift systems); and horizontal surface pumping systems that move fluids on the surface for applications such as injection, disposal, transfer, and pipeline boosting.


• | Upstream Chemicals - Includes chemical technologies and services that solve production challenges related to flow assurance, production optimization, asset integrity, and water management.


• | Pressure Pumping - Includes onshore and offshore cementing, stimulation services (hydraulic fracturing, acidizing, stimulation vessels, etc.) and coiled tubing services used in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and in remedial work on existing wells. Hydraulic fracturing is the practice of pumping fluid through a wellbore at pressures and rates sufficient to crack rock in the target formation, extend the cracks, and leave behind a propping agent to keep the cracks open after pumping ceases. 

4

The purpose of the cracks is to provide a pathway that allows for the passage of hydrocarbons from the rock to the wellbore, thus improving the production of hydrocarbons to the surface. On December 30, 2016, we contributed our North American onshore pressure pumping business to a newly formed venture ("BJ Services, LLC"), of which we retained a 46.7% interest and accounted for as an equity method investment.
We also provide dedicated project solutions to our customers through our Integrated Operations group. Integrated Operations is focused on the execution of projects that have one or more of the following attributes: project management, well site supervision, well construction, intervention, third-party contractor management, procurement and rig management. Contracts for this business unit tend to be longer in duration, often spanning multiple years, and may include significant third-party components to supplement the core products and services provided by us. By partnering with Integrated Operations, our customers have access to a comprehensive business solution that leverages our technical expertise, relationships with third-party and rig providers, and our industry leading technologies.
Additional information regarding our oilfield products and services can be found on the Company's website at www.bakerhughes.com. Our website also includes details of our hydraulic fracturing operations, including our hydraulic fracturing chemical disclosure policy and support of the online national hydraulic fracturing chemical registry at www.fracfocus.org, and information on our SmartCare™ qualified systems and products, which are intended to maximize performance while minimizing our impact on the community and environment.
Industrial Services
Industrial Services consists primarily of our downstream chemicals, and process and pipeline services businesses and provides chemical technologies, equipment, and services that optimize operations throughout the industrial lifecycle (midstream and transportation, processing and refining, water treatment, petrochemical processing). Specifically, downstream chemicals provides products and services that help to increase refinery production, as well as improve plant safety and equipment. Process and pipeline services work to improve efficiency and reduce downtime with inspection, pre-commissioning and commissioning of new and existing pipeline systems and process plants.
MARKETING, COMPETITION AND CONTRACTING
We market our products and services within our four geographic regions on a product line basis primarily through our own sales organizations. We provide technical and advisory services to assist in our customers' use of our products and services. Stock points and service centers for our products and services are located in areas of drilling and production activity throughout the world.
Our primary competitors include the major diversified oilfield service companies such as Schlumberger, Halliburton and Weatherford International, where the breadth of service capabilities as well as competitive position of each product line are the keys to differentiation in the market. We also compete with other companies who may participate in only a few of the same product lines as us, such as National Oilwell Varco, Ecolab, Newpark Resources and FTS International. Our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and revenue and earnings are affected by changes in commodity prices, fluctuations in the level of drilling, workover and completion activity in major markets, general economic conditions, foreign currency exchange fluctuations and governmental regulations. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industries are product and service quality, reliability and availability, health, safety and environmental standards, technical proficiency and price.
Our customers include the large integrated major and super-major oil and natural gas companies, U.S. and international independent oil and natural gas companies and the national or state-owned oil companies. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of our business. While we may have contracts with customers that include multiple well projects and that may extend over a period of time ranging from two to four years, our services and products are generally provided on a well-by-well basis. Most contracts cover our pricing of the products and services, but do not necessarily establish an obligation to use our products and services.
We strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to be best practices. The general industry practice is for oilfield service providers, like us, to be responsible for their own products and services and for our customers to retain liability for drilling and related operations. Consistent with this 
5

practice, we generally take responsibility for our own people and property while our customers, such as the operator of a well, take responsibility for their own people, property and all liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations, regardless of either party's negligence. In general, any material limitations on indemnifications to us from our customers in support of this allocation of responsibility arise only by applicable statutes.
Certain states such as Texas, Louisiana, Wyoming, and New Mexico have enacted oil and natural gas specific statutes that void any indemnity agreement that attempts to relieve a party from liability resulting from its own negligence ("anti-indemnity statutes"). These statutes can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract; however, both the Texas and Louisiana anti-indemnity statutes include important exclusions. The Louisiana statute does not apply to property damage, and the Texas statute allows mutual indemnity agreements that are supported by insurance and has exclusions, which include, among other things, loss or liability for property damage that results from pollution and the cost of well control events. We negotiate with our customers in the U.S. to include a choice of law provision adopting the law of a state that does not have an anti-indemnity statute because both Baker Hughes and our customers generally prefer to contract on the basis as we mutually agree. When this does not occur, we will generally use Texas law. With the exclusions contained in the Texas anti-indemnity statute, we are usually able to structure the contract such that the limitation on the indemnification obligations of the customer is limited and should not have a material impact on the terms of the contract. State law, laws or public policy in countries outside the U.S., or the negotiated terms of our agreement with the customer may also limit the customer's indemnity obligations in the event of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of a Company employee. The Company and the customer may also agree to other limitations on the customer's indemnity obligations in the contract.
The Company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers against certain operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims, as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which the Company is liable; however, clean up and well control costs are not covered by such program. All of the insurance policies purchased by the Company are subject to deductible and/or self-insured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment, specific terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions. There can be no assurance that the nature and amount of Company insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities related to our business.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND PATENTS
Our products and technology organization engages in research and development activities directed primarily toward the development of new products, processes and services, the improvement of existing products and services and the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs. We have technology centers located in the U.S. (several in Houston, Texas and surrounding areas and one in Claremore, Oklahoma), Germany (Celle), Russia (Novosibirsk), and Saudi Arabia (Dhahran). For information regarding the total amount of research and development expense in each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, see Note 1. "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.
We have followed a policy of seeking patent and trademark protection in numerous countries and regions throughout the world for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance. We believe our patents, trademarks, and related intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business, and aggressively pursue protection of our intellectual property rights against infringement worldwide. Additionally, we consider the quality and timely delivery of our products, the service we provide to our customers and the technical knowledge and skills of our personnel to be other important components of the portfolio of capabilities and assets supporting our ability to compete. No single patent or trademark is considered to be critical to our business.
SEASONALITY
Our operations can be affected by seasonal weather, which can temporarily affect the delivery and performance of our products and services, and our customers' budgetary cycles. Examples of seasonal events that can impact our business are set forth below:

• | The severity and duration of both the summer and the winter in North America can have a significant impact on activity levels. In Canada, the timing and duration of the spring thaw directly affects activity levels, which 

6

reach seasonal lows during the second quarter and build through the third and fourth quarters to a seasonal high in the first quarter.

• | Adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore drilling and production operations.


• | Severe weather during the winter months normally results in reduced activity levels in the North Sea and Russia generally in the first quarter.


• | Scheduled repair and maintenance of offshore facilities in the North Sea can reduce activity in the second and third quarters.


• | Many of our international oilfield customers increase orders for certain products and services in the fourth quarter.


• | Our Industrial Services segment typically experiences lower sales during the first and fourth quarters of the year due to the Northern Hemisphere winter.

RAW MATERIALS
We purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products and delivering our services. The principal materials we purchase include, but are not limited to, steel alloys (including chromium and nickel), titanium, barite, beryllium, copper, lead, tungsten carbide, synthetic and natural diamonds, gels, sand and other proppants, printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbon-based chemical feed stocks. These materials are generally available from multiple sources and may be subject to price volatility. While we generally do not experience significant or long-term shortages of these materials, we have from time to time experienced temporary shortages of particular raw materials. We do not expect significant interruptions in the supply of raw materials, but there can be no assurance that there will be no price or supply issues over the long-term.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 33,000 employees, of which the majority are outside the U.S. Approximately 10% of these employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements or similar-type labor arrangements.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
We are committed to the health and safety of people, protection of the environment and compliance with laws, regulations and our policies. Our past and present operations include activities that are subject to extensive domestic (including U.S. federal, state and local) and international regulations with regard to air, land and water quality and other environmental matters. We believe we are in substantial compliance with these regulations. Regulation in this area continues to evolve, and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations, as well as the enactment and enforcement of new legislation, may require us and our customers to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation. Our environmental compliance expenditures and our capital costs for environmental control equipment may change accordingly.
We are involved in voluntary remediation projects at certain of our facilities. On rare occasions, remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agency-issued consent decree or agreed order. Estimated remediation costs are accrued using currently available facts, existing environmental permits, technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. For sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation, our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted. We record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation, remediation or related activities, 
8

and such amounts can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation. Ongoing environmental compliance costs, such as obtaining environmental permits, installation of pollution control equipment and waste disposal, are expensed as incurred.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (known as "Superfund") imposes liability for the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. Superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault, even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") and appropriate state agencies supervise investigative and cleanup activities at Superfund sites. We have been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") in remedial activities related to various Superfund sites, and we accrue our share of the estimated remediation costs of the site based on the ratio of the estimated volume of waste we contributed to the site to the total volume of waste disposed at the site. PRPs in Superfund actions have joint and several liability for all costs of remediation. Accordingly, a PRP may be required to pay more than its proportional share of such costs. For some projects, it is not possible to quantify our ultimate exposure because the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage, or allocation information is not yet available. However, based upon current information, we do not believe that probable or reasonably possible expenditures in connection with the sites are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements because we have recorded adequate reserves to cover the estimate we presently believe will be our ultimate liability in the matter. Further, other PRPs involved in the sites have substantial assets and may reasonably be expected to pay their share of the cost of remediation, and, in some circumstances, we have insurance coverage or contractual indemnities from third parties to cover a portion of the ultimate liability.
Based upon current information, we believe that our overall compliance with environmental regulations, including routine environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our cost for that compliance is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our total accrual for environmental remediation was $31 million and $35 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which included accruals of $2 million in each year for the various Superfund sites.
We are subject to various other governmental proceedings and regulations, including foreign regulations, relating to environmental matters, but we do not believe that any of these matters are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. We continue to focus on reducing future environmental liabilities by maintaining appropriate Company standards and by improving our assurance programs.
