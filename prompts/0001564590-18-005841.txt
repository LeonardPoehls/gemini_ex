Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a pure-play Mid-Continent independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs.  Our principal business activities include the identification, acquisition and subsequent exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties with an emphasis on unconventional reserves, such as shale resource plays. We hold a concentrated acreage position in the normally pressured oil window of the STACK Play, an area of central Oklahoma which is home to multiple oil and natural gas-rich reservoirs, including the Oswego limestone, Meramec and Osage bench formations within the Mississippi Lime, the Woodford shale and Hunton limestone formations.   
 Shares of our common stock are listed on the NYSE American under the symbol “GST,” shares of our 8.625% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock are listed on the NYSE American under the symbol “GST.PRA” and shares of our 10.75% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock are listed on the NYSE American under the symbol “GST.PRB”. Our principal office is located at 1331 Lamar Street, Suite 650, Houston, Texas 77010, and our telephone number is (713) 739-1800. Our website address is http://www.gastar.com. Information on our website or about us on any other website is not incorporated by reference into and does not constitute part of this Form 10-K.
 Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to increase stockholder value by delivering sustainable reserves and production growth and improved operating results from our existing assets. We recognize that there may be periods, such as the recently depressed commodity price environment commencing in 2014, which make it difficult to fully execute this strategy on a short-term basis. We intend to implement our strategy by focusing on:

• | development and exploitation of our Mid-Continent assets in the STACK Play;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | active management of our drilling programs; and
--+------------------------------------------------


• | effective management, adoption and utilization of technological advancement.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Development and Exploitation of our Mid-Continent Assets in the STACK Play
 Subsequent to the sale of our Appalachian Basin assets in 2016, we have focused our activities solely in the STACK Play.  
 We believe that our acreage is prospective in the normally pressured oil window of the STACK Play, an area of central Oklahoma that includes oil and natural gas-rich formations such as the Meramec, Osage and Woodford shale, ranging in depth from 6,000 to 9,000 feet, and in the shallow Oswego formation as well as the proven Hunton limestone horizontal oil play.  We believe that the STACK Play is one of the most economic plays in North America.  It is a horizontal drilling play in an area of previously drilled vertical wells with multiple productive reservoirs that are predominantly oil producing.  The STACK Play encompasses all or parts of Blaine, Canadian, Garfield, Kingfisher and Major counties in Oklahoma.  STACK is an acronym for Sooner Trend Anadarko Canadian Kingfisher.  At December 31, 2017, we held leases covering approximately 136,700 gross (93,400 net) acres in Garfield, Kingfisher, Logan, Blaine and Oklahoma Counties, Oklahoma, within the STACK Play, of which 26,100 gross (25,200 net) acres are attributable to the West Edmund Hunton Lime Unit (“WEHLU”), which we sold on February 28, 2018 for net cash proceeds of $98.8 million at closing.  Subsequent to the closing of the WEHLU sale, we hold leases covering approximately 96,100 gross (67,800 net) acres in the STACK Play.  
 Actively Manage Our Drilling Program in the STACK Play
 We believe that dedicating the majority of our capital budget for 2018 to drilling and completing wells that we operate will enable us to control the timing and cost of our drilling and completion activities, as well as control operating costs and the marketing of our production.  Control over our costs and expenditures is increasingly important in achieving acceptable returns on capital investment.  Our preliminary capital budget for 2018, which is dedicated exclusively to our STACK Play activities, is approximately $115.0 million, which includes $69.5 million for STACK operated drilling, completions and recompletions, $15.7 million for our participation in non-operated STACK Play drilling, $18.2 million for maintaining our current Oklahoma leasehold position and $11.6 million for capitalized interest and administration costs.  We may also seek opportunistic acquisitions of acreage positions in the STACK Play, with or without existing production, depending on the availability of capital and the quality and strategic importance of such acreage to our position.    We believe that we have assembled an experienced team of operating professionals with the specialized skills needed to plan and execute the drilling and completion of horizontal STACK Play wells.

Management, Adoption and Utilization of Technological Advancements
 We believe that enhanced natural gas recovery processes, horizontal drilling and other advanced drilling, formation evaluation and production techniques are valuable tools that improve drilling results and ultimately enhance production and returns. We believe that utilizing these technologies and production techniques in exploring for, developing and exploiting natural gas and oil properties has helped us reduce drilling risks, lower finding costs and provide for more efficient production of natural gas and oil from our properties.
Oil and Natural Gas Activities
 The following provides an overview of our major oil and natural gas projects during the past three fiscal years. There is no assurance that new drilling opportunities will be identified or that any new drilling opportunities will be successful if drilled. For additional information regarding our sources of revenue and historical expenditures, please see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Mid-Continent Horizontal Oil Plays
 The following is a description of our oil and natural gas producing activities in the Mid-Continent over the last three years. 
 Subsequent to the sale of our Appalachian Basin assets in 2016, we focused our activities solely in the STACK Play.  Subsequent to the closing of the WEHLU Sale, we hold leases covering approximately 96,100 gross (67,800 net) acres in the STACK Play.     
 Our initial leasing activities in the Mid-Continent commenced in 2012 primarily in northwest Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, with an AMI co-participant and were expanded to include two additional adjacent prospect areas.  We continued to build our acreage position in this region during 2013 through 2015 with our AMI co-participant, Husky Ventures, Inc., who prior to the closing of the Husky Acquisition (as defined below), handled all drilling, completion and production activities while we handled leasing and permitting activities in certain areas of the AMI.  On December 16, 2015, we completed the acquisition of additional working and net revenue interests in 103 gross (10.2 net) producing wells and certain undeveloped acreage in the STACK Play and Hunton limestone formations in our existing AMI from our AMI co-participant and three other sellers for an adjusted purchase price of approximately $42.7 million, net of $358,000 of revenue suspense liability assumed by us, reflecting adjustment for an acquisition effective date of July 1, 2015, and the conveyance of approximately 11,000 net non-core, non-producing acres in Blaine, Major and Kingfisher Counties, Oklahoma to the sellers, subject to certain adjustments and customary closing conditions (the “Husky Acquisition”).  As a result of the Husky Acquisition, we assumed operatorship of a majority of the acquired wells and our AMI participation agreements with our AMI co-participant were dissolved.  On March 22, 2017, we completed the acquisition of additional working and net revenue interests in approximately 66 gross (9.5 net) producing wells and 5,670 net acres of additional undeveloped STACK Play leasehold in Kingfisher County, Oklahoma for $51.4 million (the “STACK Leasehold Acquisition”).  Prior to the STACK Leasehold Acquisition, we already held an interest in the majority of this acquired producing wells and acreage.  
 On October 14, 2016, we executed a definitive agreement with STACK Exploration LLC (the “Investor”) to jointly develop up to 60 Gastar operated wells in the STACK Play in Kingfisher County, Oklahoma (the “Development Agreement”).  The drilling program (the “Drilling Program”) targeted the Meramec and Osage formations within the Mississippi Lime in a contract area within three townships covering approximately 32,900 gross (21,200 net) undeveloped net mineral acres under leases held by us. We serve as operator of all Drilling Program wells.
 Under the Development Agreement, the Investor funded 90% of our working interest portion of drilling and completion costs to initially earn 80% of our working interest in each new well (in each case, proportionately reduced by other participating working interests in the well).  As a result, we paid 10% of our working interest portion of such costs for 20% of our original working interest in the well.  
 The Drilling Program wells were to be mutually developed in three tranches of 20 wells each.  The locations of the first 20 wells, comprised of 18 Meramec formation wells and two Osage formation wells, were mutually agreed upon by us and the Investor.  Participation in the second tranche of 20 Drilling Program wells was to be at the election of the Investor and the third tranche of 20 wells was to require mutual consent.  By December 31, 2017, we had drilled and completed all 20 gross (3.2 net) wells under the first tranche of the Development Agreement, all of which were on production.  As of July 31, 2017, the Investor elected not to participate in a second tranche of wells.
 With respect to each 20 wells drilled under the Drilling Program, when the Investor has achieved an aggregate 15% internal rate of return for its investment for all wells, its interest will be reduced from 80% to 40% of our original working interest and our working interest increases from 20% to 60% of our original working interest.  If and when the internal rate of return of 20% for all 20 wells in the aggregate 
 
8


is achieved by the Investor, the Investor’s working interest decreases to 10% and our working interest increases to 90% of the working interest originally owned by us (the “final reversion”). 
If and when the final reversion of working interest in the completed 20 well tranche should occur, the Investor has the right, but not the obligation, for a period of six months after final reversion to cause us to purchase the Investor’s remaining interest in the 20 wells in the Drilling Program (the “WI Tail”) for such tranche (the “Investor Put Right”) for fair market value by applying the methodology to determine a 15% discounted present value as defined by the Development Agreement.  If the Investor fails to exercise the Investor Put Right within the six-month period after achieving final reversion, then for a period of six months thereafter, we shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the WI Tail from the Investor on the same fair market value approach of the Investor Put Right.  If final reversion has not been achieved by August 19, 2024, Investor will, for a period of six months thereafter, have the right to cause us to buy Investor’s then-current interest in the Drilling Program wells at an agreed upon valuation.  Based on current commodity prices, well cost and production performance of the wells drilled in the first tranche, the 15% internal rate of return is not anticipated to be achieved.
 On October 19, 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell certain non-core leasehold interests in approximately 25,300 net acres of which only 19,100 net acres was ascribed allocated value and interests in 25 gross (11.2 net) wells primarily in northeast Canadian County and also in southeast Kingfisher County, Oklahoma to Red Bluff Resources Operating, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, (“Red Bluff”) for $71.0 million (of which up to $10.0 million was contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions), subject to certain adjustments and with a property sale effective date of August 1, 2016 (“South STACK Play Acreage Sale”).  On November 18, 2016, we and Red Bluff executed and delivered two amendments to the sale agreement and entered into a relating closing agreement, which, among other things, allocated $1.4 million of the purchase price to producing properties with the remainder of the purchase price to non-producing properties.  As of September 30, 2017, we had completed the sale and received approximately $69.5 million of the South STACK Play Acreage Sale proceeds.   
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, we spud 11 gross (3.1 net) operated Meramec wells and completed 15 gross (3.8 net) operated Meramec wells.  
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, we spud 17 gross (11.5 net) operated Osage wells and completed 16 gross (10.6 net) operated Osage wells.  Subsequent to December 31, 2017 through March 12, 2018, we spud three gross (2.5 net) operated Osage wells and completed two gross (1.8 net) operated Osage wells.  
 During 2017, we elected to participate in various non-operated wells in the Meramec, Osage and Oswego formations to further delineate our STACK Play acreage position.  Of the 2017 non-operated wells that we elected to participate, 19 gross (2.8 net) wells were spud and 16 gross (2.3 net) wells were completed.    Subsequent to December 31, 2017 through March 12, 2018, two gross (0.01 net) non-operated wells in which we have an interest were spud and two gross (0.3 net) non-operated wells in which we have an interest were completed.  We anticipate that we will continue to receive election notices regarding proposed non-operated STACK wells.
 At December 31, 2017, proved reserves attributable to the Mid-Continent were approximately 42.9 MMBoe, a 68% increase from year-end 2016 reserves of 25.6 MMBoe.  Proved reserves at December 31, 2017 were comprised of 23.0 MMBoe STACK Play reserves and 19.9 MMBoe of WEHLU reserves.  The 17.3 MMBoe increase in proved reserves from year-end 2016 is primarily the result of the success of our STACK Play drilling during 2017.  At December 31, 2017, Mid-Continent proved reserves represented 100% of our total proved reserves and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) total proved PV-10 value.  Total Mid-Continent proved reserves at year-end 2017 and 2016 were comprised of approximately 75% of oil, condensate and NGLs reserves.  Approximately 42% and 51% of the Mid-Continent year-end 2017 and year-end 2016 reserves were proved developed, respectively.
 For 2018, our focus is to drill in areas that we believe will result in de-risking of additional acreage within the STACK Play and hold by production near-term expiring acreage while increasing our production and cash flow.

Appalachian Basin
 Due to the depressed commodity price environment in the Appalachian Basin, we suspended our drilling operations in the Appalachian Basin in the second quarter of 2015.  On April 8, 2016, we sold substantially all of our producing assets and proved reserves and a significant portion of our undeveloped acreage in the Appalachian Basin for an adjusted price of $75.7 million, net of $3.5 million of suspense liability transferred to buyer (the “Appalachian Basin Sale”).  On January 20, 2017, we sold our remaining interest in producing assets and leasehold in the Appalachian Basin, effective January 1, 2017, for $200,000, before fees and expenses.

Markets and Customers
 The success of our operations is dependent primarily upon prevailing and future prices for oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs. The markets for oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs have historically been and currently continue to be volatile. Oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs prices are beyond our control.  The prices we receive for our oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs production are subject to wide fluctuations and depend on numerous factors beyond our control including seasonality, the condition of the United States economy, foreign imports, political conditions in other petroleum producing countries, the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, domestic regulation, legislation and policies. Decreases in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas have had, and could have in the future, an adverse effect on the carrying value of our proved reserves, our revenue, profitability and cash flow from operations.  For additional information regarding the prices we receive for our oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs production, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs prices are volatile.  Substantial declines in commodity prices have significantly and negatively affected our financial condition and results of operations.”
 Our oil, condensate and NGLs production in the Mid-Continent is sold under spot sales transactions at market prices.  The availability and price responsiveness of the multiple oil and condensate purchasers provides for a highly competitive and liquid market for oil sales.
 We contract to sell natural gas from our properties with spot market contracts that vary with market forces on a daily basis. While overall natural gas prices at major markets, such as Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, may have some impact on regional prices, the regional natural gas price at our production facilities may move somewhat independently of broad industry price trends. We are directly impacted by natural gas prices in the regions in which we operate regardless of pricing at major market hubs. We do not own or operate any natural gas lines or distribution facilities and rely on third parties to construct additional interstate pipelines to increase our ability to bring our production to market. Any significant change affecting these facilities or our failure to obtain timely access to existing or future facilities on acceptable terms could restrict our ability to conduct normal operations. Delays in the commencement of operations of new pipelines, the unavailability of new pipelines or other facilities due to market conditions, mechanical reasons or otherwise could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. (“Sunoco”) purchases the majority of our Mid-Continent oil production.  Superior Pipeline Company (“Superior”) purchases the majority of our natural gas and NGLs production.  There are numerous purchase and transportation alternatives currently available in the Mid-Continent so in the event that Sunoco or Superior were to cease purchasing and transporting our oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs production, our ability to conduct normal operations would not be significantly restricted.  Prior to its bankruptcy filing in June 2016, SEI Energy, LLC (“SEI”) purchased the majority of our Appalachian Basin production. For more information, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Our ability to market our oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs may be impaired by capacity constraints and availability of the gathering systems and pipelines that transport our oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs.”
 Competition
 The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive in all of its phases. We encounter competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all areas of our operations. In seeking suitable oil and natural gas properties for acquisition, we compete with other companies operating in our areas of interest, including large oil and natural gas companies and other independent operators, many of whom have greater financial resources and, in many instances, have been engaged in the exploration and production business for a much longer time than we have. Many of our competitors also have substantially larger operating staffs than we do. Many of these competitors not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also market oil and natural gas and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These competitors may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than us. In addition, these competitors may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low market prices. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. For more information, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense. We are smaller and have less operating history than many of our competitors, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our results of operations.”
 Prices of our oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs production are controlled by market forces. Competition in the oil and natural gas exploration industry, however, also exists in the form of competition to acquire leases and obtain favorable transportation prices. We are smaller and have a more limited operating history than most of our competitors and may have difficulty acquiring additional acreage and/or projects and arranging for the transportation of our production. We also face competition in obtaining oil and natural gas drilling rigs and in providing the manpower to operate them and provide related services.
 Seasonal Nature of Business
 Generally, the demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates seasonally. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in certain areas. These seasonal anomalies can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages, increase our costs or delay our operations.
U.S. Governmental Regulation
 Our oil and natural gas exploration, production and related operations are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated in the United States. These laws and regulations, all of which are subject to change from time to time, include matters relating to land tenure; drilling and production practices, such as discharge permits and the spacing of wells; the disposal of water resulting from operations and the processing, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, such as hydrocarbons and naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”); bonding requirements; ongoing obligations for licensing; reporting requirements; marketing and pricing policies; royalties; taxation; and foreign trade and investment.

Failure to comply with governmental rules and regulations can result in substantial sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Furthermore, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, spills, discharge of hazardous materials, reclamation costs, remediation, clean-up costs and other environmental damages as a consequence of acquiring an oil or natural gas prospect or acreage.
 The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our financial condition. Historically, our compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with applicable laws and regulations because those legal requirements are frequently amended or reinterpreted. We are unable to predict what additional legislation or amendments may be proposed that will affect our operations or when any such proposals, if enacted, might become effective. We do not expect that any of these laws would affect us in a materially different manner than any other similarly sized oil and natural gas company operating in the United States.
 Regulation of Exploration and Production
 Regulation of Production
 The production of oil and natural gas is subject to extensive regulation under a wide range of federal, state and local statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require, among other things, permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation matters, including some provisions for the unitization or pooling of the oil and natural gas properties; the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells; the spacing of wells; and the plugging and abandonment of wells and removal of related production equipment. These and other regulations can limit the amount of the oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells, limit the number of wells we can drill or limit the locations at which we can conduct drilling operations. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to production and sale of crude oil, natural gas, condensate and NGLs within its jurisdiction.
Oklahoma Forced Pooling Laws
 We rely upon the Oklahoma “forced pooling” laws and regulations to increase our working interest in drilling units, or increase the participation levels in a proposed well to render the project economic, for wells we propose to drill as operator in the STACK Play.  Any such increase in working interest would lead to a proportionate increase in our share of the production and reserves associated with any such successfully drilled well.  Under Oklahoma law, if a party proposes to drill the initial well to a particular formation in a specific drilling and spacing unit but cannot obtain the agreement of all other oil and natural gas interest holders and other leaseholders within the unit as to how the unit should be developed, the party may commence a “forced pooling” process.  Under current regulations, the proposed operator is required to demonstrate in an administrative proceeding that it has made a good faith effort to bargain with all of the respondents prior to filing its application.  The fair market value of the mineral interests in the unit is determined in the administrative proceeding by reference to market transactions involving nearby oil and natural gas rights, especially what has been paid for mineral leases in the particular drilling and spacing unit and the immediately surrounding drilling and spacing units.
 Assuming the application is granted and a forced pooling order is granted, the respondents then have 20 days to elect either to participate in the proposed well or accept fair market value for their interest, usually in the form of a cash payment, an overriding royalty, or some combination, based on the fair market value established and approved through the administrative hearing.  The pooling order usually also addresses the time frame for drilling the well and provides for the manner in which future wells within the unit may be drilled.  The applicant for the pooling order is ordinarily designated as the operator of the wells subject to the pooling order.
 The availability of forced pooling makes it difficult for a small number of owners to block or delay the drilling of a particular well proposed by another interest holder. Exploration and production companies in Oklahoma often negotiate to lease as much of the mineral interests in a particular area as are readily available at acceptable rates, and then use the forced pooling process to proceed with the desired development of the well.  Due to increased interest in the STACK Play as an economic play in the current price and cost environment, however, third party interest holders may be more likely to bear their proportionate share of the costs of the proposed future wells on our acreage.
 Regulation of Sales of Natural Gas
 The price at which we buy and sell natural gas is currently not subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. However, with regard to our physical purchases and sales of these energy commodities, and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) and/or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). See the discussion below of “- Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry – Energy Policy Act of 2005.” Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third party damage claims by, among others, market participants, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities. In addition, we would be required to annually report to FERC on May 1 of each year information regarding natural gas purchase and sale transactions if we have purchase or sale transactions that contribute or may contribute to the formation of a gas index 
 
15


during the prior calendar year in excess of 2.2 million MMBtu. See the discussion below of “- Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry – FERC Market Transparency Rules.”
 Regulation of Availability, Terms and Cost of Pipeline Transportation
 The availability, terms and cost of transportation can significantly affect sales of natural gas. FERC regulates interstate natural gas pipeline transportation rates and service conditions, which affect the marketing of natural gas produced by us and the revenues received by us for sales of such natural gas. FERC requires interstate pipelines to offer available firm transportation capacity on an open access, non-discriminatory basis to all natural gas shippers. FERC frequently reviews and modifies its regulations regarding the transportation of natural gas with the stated goal of fostering competition within all phases of the natural gas industry. In addition, with respect to production onshore or in state waters, the intra-state transportation of natural gas would be subject to state regulatory jurisdiction as well.
 The ability of our facilities to deliver natural gas into third party natural gas pipeline facilities is directly impacted by the gas quality specifications required by those pipelines. In 2006, FERC issued a policy statement on provisions governing gas quality and interchangeability in the tariffs of interstate gas pipeline companies and a separate order declining to set generic prescriptive national standards. FERC strongly encouraged all natural gas pipelines subject to its jurisdiction to adopt, as needed, gas quality and interchangeability standards in their FERC gas tariffs modeled on the interim guidelines issued by a group of industry representatives headed by the Natural Gas Council (the “NGC+ Work Group”), or to explain how and why their tariff provisions differ. We have no way to predict, however, whether FERC will approve of gas quality specifications that materially differ from the NGC+ Work Group’s interim guidelines for such an interconnecting pipeline.
 State laws and regulations generally govern the gathering and intrastate transportation of natural gas. Natural gas gathering systems in the states in which we operate are generally required to offer services on a non-discriminatory basis, and are subject to state ratable take and common purchaser statutes. Ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply.
 Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry
 Energy Policy Act of 2005. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPAct 2005”), Congress made it unlawful for any entity, including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers of natural gas, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services regulated by the FERC that violates the FERC’s rules. FERC’s rules implementing the provision of EPAct 2005 make it unlawful for any entity in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. EPAct 2005 also gives the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act up to $1,238,271 per day per violation. While EPAct 2005 reflects a significant expansion of the FERC’s enforcement authority, we do not anticipate that we will be affected by that statute any differently than other producers of natural gas.
 CFTC Anti-Market Manipulation Regulation.  The CFTC also holds authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities market including oil and natural gas.  With regard to physical purchases and sales of natural gas and other energy commodities, and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are thus required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC and/or the CFTC.  The CFTC also holds substantial enforcement authority, including the ability to assess civil penalties of up to $1,162,183 per day per violation.  
 FERC Market Transparency Rules.  Under FERC regulations, wholesale buyers and sellers of physical natural gas are required to report on Form No. 552 on May 1 of each year aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year in excess of 2.2 million MMBtu to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices. 
 Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending or are considered from time to time by Congress, FERC, state regulatory bodies and the courts. We cannot predict when or if any such proposals might become effective or their effect, if any, on our operations. We do not believe that we will be affected by any action taken in a materially different way than other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete.
 Federal Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Crude Oil. The oil industry is also extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Prices for crude oil and condensate are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.  Our sales of these commodities are, however, subject to laws and to regulations issued by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) prohibiting manipulative or fraudulent conduct in the wholesale petroleum market. The FTC 
 
16


holds substantial enforcement authority under these regulations, including the ability to assess civil penalties of up to $1,180,566 day per violation. Our sales of these commodities, and any related hedging activities, are also subject to CFTC oversight as discussed above.
 In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products on interstate pipelines is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”). The ICA requires that pipelines maintain a tariff on file with FERC. The tariff sets forth the established rate as well as the rules and regulations governing the service. The ICA requires, among other things, that rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable.” The ICA permits challenges to existing rates and authorizes FERC to investigate such rates to determine whether they are just and reasonable. If, upon completion of an investigation, FERC finds that the existing rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation and, in some cases, reparations for the two (2) year period prior to the filing of a complaint. We do not believe, however, that these regulations affect us any differently than other producers.
 Effective as of January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. The FERC’s regulation of crude oil and natural gas liquids transportation rates may tend to increase the cost of transporting crude oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipelines, although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year. Every five years, the FERC must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry. We are not able at this time to predict the effects of these regulations or FERC proceedings, if any, on the transportation costs associated with crude oil production from our crude oil producing operations.
 Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated.
 Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by pro-rationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our similarly situated competitors.
 Our operations are subject to extensive and continually changing regulation affecting the natural gas and oil industry. Many departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue, and have issued, rules and regulations binding on the natural gas and oil industry and its individual participants. The failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the natural gas and oil industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability. We do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different manner by these regulations than are our competitors.
 U.S. Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulation
 Our oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations, and similar operations that we do not operate but in which we own a working interest, are subject to stringent federal, tribal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing worker safety and health, environmental protection and the discharge of substances into the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, which may cause us to incur significant capital expenditures on costly actions to achieve and maintain compliance. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits, including drilling permits, before conducting regulated activities; restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that may be released into the environment as a result of natural gas and oil drilling, production and processing activities; suspend, limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities in certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; restrict injection of produced water or other regulated fluids into subsurface strata that may contaminate groundwater or result in seismic incidents; require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from historical and on-going operations such as the use of pits and plugging of abandoned wells; impose specific safety and health criteria addressing workforce protection; and impose liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Failure to comply with these environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects, or the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting operations in affected areas.
 
17


The trend in environmental legislation and regulation is toward stricter standards to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may adversely affect the environment.  Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.  If substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities for environmental claims are incurred, the payment of such claims may reduce or eliminate the funds available for project investment or result in loss of our properties. Moreover, a serious incident of pollution arising from our operations may result in our being liable for material remedial costs and damages to natural resources or properties as well as the suspension or cessation of our operations in the affected area. Although we maintain insurance coverage against costs of certain clean-up operations, no assurance can be given that we have insurance or are fully insured against all such potential risks. The imposition of any of these liabilities or compliance obligations on us may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 The following is a summary of some of the more significant existing environmental laws, as amended from time to time, to which our business operations are subject.
 Hazardous Substances and Wastes
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and analogous state laws impose strict, joint and several liability without regard to fault or legality of conduct on persons who are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that transported, disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, these “responsible parties” may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. Although CERCLA currently excludes, among other things, petroleum, natural gas and NGLs from the definition of hazardous substance, our operations as well as other operations in which we own a working interest generate materials that are subject to regulation as hazardous substances under CERCLA.
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws regulate the generation, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Our operations, and other operations in which we own a working interest, generate wastes, including hazardous wastes that are subject to RCRA and comparable state laws. Although RCRA currently excludes certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes from the definition of hazardous waste, allowing us to manage these wastes under RCRA's less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements, we cannot assure that this exclusion will be preserved in the future.  For example, in response to a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency’s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016.  Under the decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary.  If EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021.  Any removal of this exclusion could increase the amount of hazardous waste we and other operators of exploration and production activities in which we own a working interest are required to manage and dispose of and could cause us and such other operators to incur increased operating costs, which could have a significant impact on us as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general.
 Moreover, there have been public concerns expressed about NORM being detected in flow back water resulting from hydraulic fracturing. NORM is subject primarily to individual state radiation control regulations while NORM handling and management activities are governed by regulations promulgated by OSHA. These state and federal regulations impose certain requirements concerning worker protection with respect to NORM as well as the treatment, storage and disposal of such flow back water generated from these activities. Concern over NORM in general, or NORM in groundwater in particular,  could result in further regulation in the treatment, storage, handling and discharge of flow back water generated from oil and natural gas activities, including hydraulic fracturing, that, if implemented, could limit drilling or increase the costs of drilling in affected regions.
 We currently own, lease, own a working interest in, or operate numerous properties that for many years have been used for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas. Although we utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned, leased or operated by us or in which we own an interest, or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal or recycling. In addition, many of the properties now operated by us, as well as the properties in which we own a working interest, have been operated by previous owners or operators or other third parties whose treatment and disposal of hazardous 
 
18


substances, wastes, or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes (including substances disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), remediate contaminated property (including groundwater contamination) or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination.
 Water Discharges and Subsurface Injections
 Our operations and other operations in which we own a working interest are subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and analogous state laws. These laws and their implementing regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including oil and hazardous substances, into waters of the United States and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements imposed under the CWA require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The CWA also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit.  The EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) published a final rule in June 2015 that attempted to clarify federal jurisdiction under the CWA over waters of the United States, including wetlands, but legal challenges to this rule followed.  The 2015 rule was stayed nationwide to determine whether federal district or appellate courts had jurisdiction to hear cases in the matter and, in January 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.  The EPA and Corps proposed a rulemaking in June 2017 to repeal the June 2015 rule, announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the CWA’s jurisdiction, and published a final rule on February 6, 2018 specifying that the contested May 2015 rule would not take effect until February 6, 2020.  Recently, on January 22, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision finding that jurisdiction resides with the federal district courts; consequently, implementation of the 2015 rule currently remains stayed, and the previously-filed district court cases will be allowed to proceed.  As a result of these recent developments, future implementation of the June 2015 rule is uncertain at this time but to the extent any rule expands the scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas.    
 The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) amends the CWA and sets standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills. The OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities, and onshore facilities, including exploration and production facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under OPA, responsible parties including owners and operators of onshore facilities may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. The OPA also requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare Facility Response Plans for responding to a worst-case discharge of oil into waters of the United States.
 Our oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations, and other operations in which we own a working interest, generate produced water, drilling muds and other waste streams, some of which may be disposed by injection in underground wells situated in non-producing subsurface formations. The drilling and operation of these injection wells are regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and analogous state laws. The Underground Injection Well Program under the SDWA requires that we obtain permits from the EPA or analogous state agencies for our disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for injection well operations, restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be injected, and prohibits the migration of fluids containing any contaminants into underground sources of drinking water. Any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells may cause degradation of freshwater, potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well, imposition of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of affected resources, and imposition of liability by landowners or other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages and personal injuries. 
 Furthermore, in response to recent seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of produced water resulting from oil and natural gas activities, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have restricted, suspended or shut down the use of such disposal wells. For example, Oklahoma, where we conduct operations, has issued rules for injection wells that impose certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on injection wells in proximity to faults and also, from time to time, developed and implemented plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend injection well operations. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission (“OCC”) has implemented a variety of measures including adopting the National Academy of Science’s “traffic light system,” pursuant to which the agency reviews new disposal well applications for proximity to faults, seismicity in the area and other factors in determining whether such wells should be permitted, permitted only with special restrictions, or not permitted and, further, evaluates existing wells to assess their continued operation, or operation with restrictions, based on location relative to such faults, seismicity and other factors.  In December 2016, the OCC’s Oil and Gas Conservation Division and the Oklahoma Geological Survey released well completion seismicity guidance, which requires operators to take certain prescriptive actions, including an operator’s planned mitigation practices, following certain unusual seismic activity within 1.25 miles of hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition, the OCC’s Oil and Gas Conservation Division issued an 
 
19


order in February 2017 limiting future increases in the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater injected belowground into the Arbuckle formation and imposed further reductions in the Edmond area of the state in August 2017.  
 Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that injection well disposal operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules governing waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for produced water disposal. Evaluation of seismic incidents and whether or to what extent those events are induced by the injection of produced water into disposal wells continues to evolve, as governmental authorities consider new and/or past seismic incidents in areas where produced water injection activities occur or are proposed to be performed. Court decisions or the adoption of any new laws, regulations, or directives that restrict our ability to dispose of saltwater generated by production and development activities, whether by plugging back the depths of disposal wells, reducing the volume of salt water disposed in such wells, restricting disposal well locations or otherwise, or by requiring us to shut down disposal wells, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Hydraulic Fracturing
 Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of oil or natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant, and chemical additives under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have conducted investigations or asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances.  Additionally, the EPA issued Clean Air Act (“CAA”) final regulations in 2012 and in June 2016 governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing; published in June 2016 an effluent limited guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants; and issued in 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing.  Also, the federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final rule in March 2015 establishing more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands.  However, in June 2016, a Wyoming federal judge struck down this final rule, finding that the BLM lacked authority to promulgate the rule, the BLM appealed the decision to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in July 2016, the appellate court issued a ruling in September 2017 to vacate the Wyoming trial court decision and dismiss the lawsuit challenging the 2015 rule in response to the BLM’s issuance of a proposed rulemaking to rescind the 2015 rule and, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule rescinding the March 2015 rule.  In January 2018, litigation challenging the BLM’s rescission of the 2015 rule was brought in federal court.    
 The U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. At the state level, some states, including Oklahoma, where we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York. Local government may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate or where we own a working interest, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
 Air Emissions
 The CAA and comparable state laws and regulations govern emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions standards, construction and operating permit programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements. Air emissions from some equipment found at our operations or other operations in which we own an interest, such as gas compressors, are potentially subject to regulations under the CAA or equivalent state and local regulatory programs, although many small air emission sources are expressly exempt from such regulations. To the extent that these air emissions are regulated, they are generally regulated by permits issued by state regulatory agencies. Any need to obtain air emissions permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues. For example, in October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion for the 8-hour primary and secondary ozone standards.  The EPA published a final rule in November 2017 that issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone for approximately 85% of the U.S. counties as either “attainment/unclassifiable” or “unclassifiable” and is expected to issue attainment or non-attainment designations for the remaining areas of the U.S. not addressed under the November 2017 final rule in the first half of 2018.  States are also expected to implement 
 
20


regulations implementing the NAAQS rule that may be more stringent than the federal standards.  Imposition of more stringent NAAQS standards may result in the installation of new emissions controls, longer permitting timelines and cause significant increases in our capital or operating expenditures, any of which developments could adversely impact our business.
 Climate Change
 Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention.  As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”).  These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes and GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources.  At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date.  The EPA has , however, adopted rules under authority of the CAA that, among other things, establish permitting reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are also potential major sources of certain principal pollutant emissions, which reviews could require meeting "best available control technology" standards for those emissions. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, including, among other things, onshore producing facilities, which include certain of our operations.    
 Federal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and natural gas operations. In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing new emissions standards for methane and additional standards for volatile organic compounds from certain new, modified, and reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category that will require the use of certain equipment specific emissions control practices.  However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of the June 2016 standards for two years and re-evaluate the entirety of the 2016 standards but the EPA has not yet published a final rule and, as a result, the June 2016 rule remains in effect but future implementation of the 2016 standards is uncertain at this time.  In another example, the BLM published a final rule in November 2016 that imposes requirements to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaking on federal and Indian lands.  However, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule that temporarily suspends or delays certain requirements contained in the November 2016 final rule until January 17, 2019.  The suspension of the November 2016 final rule is being challenged in court.  These rules, should they remain in effect, and any other new methane emission standards imposed on the oil and gas sector could result in increased costs to our operations and similar operations that we do not operate but in which we own a working interest as well as result in delays or curtailment in such operations, which costs, delays or curtailment could adversely affect our business.  Additionally, in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France in preparing an agreement requiring member countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020.  This “Paris Agreement” was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016.  However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.  
 The adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation or regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise limit emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations, or the equipment and operations of assets in which we own an interest, could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with those operations as well as delays or restrictions in our ability to permit GHG emissions from new or modified sources. In addition, substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil, natural gas and NGL we produce and lower the value of our reserves, which devaluation could be significant.  Recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production or midstream activities. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and that oil and natural gas will continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time.
 Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such physical effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration, development and production interests and operations.  At this time, we have not developed a comprehensive plan to address the legal, economic, social or physical impacts of climate change on our operations.

Endangered Species Act
 The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and similar state laws and other regulatory initiatives restrict activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Some of our operations may be located in or near areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species and, in these areas, we may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse impacts to protected species or be prohibited from conducting operations during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when our operations could have an adverse effect on the species. It is also possible that a federal or state agency could order a complete halt to our activities in certain locations if it is determined that such activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species. Moreover, as a result of one or more settlements entered into by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency is required to make determinations on the listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA pursuant to specific timelines.  The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could impair our ability to timely complete well drilling and development and could cause us to incur additional costs arising from species protection measures or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas, which delays, costs or restrictions may be significant.  If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases.  
Worker Safety and Health
 We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard issued under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the Federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes and any implementing regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. 
Operations on Federal Lands
 Performance of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities on federal lands, including Indian lands and lands administered by the BLM, may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”).  The NEPA requires federal agencies, including the BLM and the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, to evaluate major agency actions, such as the issuance of permits that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment.  The NEPA review process may take a significant amount of time and is subject to challenges by environmental groups, which have the potential to delay current and future projects.  Our current and proposed exploration, development and production activities upon federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. We are not currently planning any drilling operations on BLM leased acreage in 2018. Our future development of any project on BLM leased acreage will be subject to completion of these environmental assessments and any delays in such completion could result in delays in our exploration or production programs. Permit authorizations under NEPA are subject to protests, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may also delay or halt projects. Moreover, depending on the mitigation strategies recommended in the environmental assessments, we could incur added costs, which could be substantial.
Other Laws and Regulations
 Our operations and other operations in which we own a working interest are also impacted by regulations governing the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of NORM. Furthermore, owners, lessees and operators of natural gas and oil properties are also subject to increasing civil liability brought by surface owners and adjoining property owners. Such claims are predicated on the damage to or contamination of land resources occasioned by drilling and production operations and the products derived there from and are often based on negligence, trespass, nuisance, strict liability or fraud.
Industry Segment and Geographic Information
 We operate in one industry segment, which is the exploration, development and production of oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs in the U.S. Our current operational activities are conducted in, and our consolidated revenues are generated from, markets exclusively in the U.S. For additional information relating to our disclosure of revenues, profits and total assets in the segment in which we operate, please see Item 6. “Selected Financial Data” and Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” each included in this Form 10-K.
Filings of Reserve Estimates with Other Agencies
 Previously, we filed with the Canadian System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (“SEDAR”) revised forms related to our oil and natural gas reserves. The forms provided additional information to ensure compliance with Canadian National Instrument 51-
 
22


101, “Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities” (“NI 51-101”), as required by the Alberta Securities Commission and the Toronto Stock Exchange. The filings did not affect any of our filings with the SEC and were not considered part of our Form 10-K. 
 On December 16, 2011, the applicable provincial commissions in Canada issued a decision document which granted us exemptive relief from the disclosure requirements contained in NI 51-101. As a result, we are no longer required to comply with the requirements of NI 51-101 and accordingly, are not required to file Form 51-101F1, “Statement of Reserves Data and Other Oil and Gas Information,” revised Form 51-101F2, “Report of Reserve Data by Independent Qualified Reserves Evaluator,” and revised Form 51-101F3, “Report of Management and Directors on Oil and Gas Disclosure.” In lieu of such filings, we are permitted to provide disclosure with respect to our oil and gas activities in the form permitted by, and in accordance with, the legal requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE American. We are required to file such disclosure on SEDAR as soon as practicable after such disclosure is filed with the SEC.
 Insurance Matters
 As is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we do not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance may have been unavailable, because premium costs are considered not in line with our deemed exposure or the risk was deemed acceptable to self-insure. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 We maintain insurance at industry customary levels to limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and accidental discharges of certain prohibited substances into the environment. Such insurance might not cover the complete amount of such a claim and would not cover fines or penalties for a violation of an environmental law nor would it cover a gradual pollution loss.  We carry limited property insurance. Our control of well limits are based upon our assessment of the risk and consideration of the cost of the insurance. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors-The process of drilling for and producing oil and natural gas involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses, and we may not have enough insurance to cover these risks adequately.”
 Employees
 As of March 12, 2018, we had 46 employees, all of whom are full time. We use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services, including reservoir engineering, land, legal, regulatory reporting, environmental and tax services. On those properties where we are not the operator, we rely on outside operators to drill, produce and market our oil and natural gas. Our employees do not belong to a union or have a collective bargaining organization. Management considers its relationship with its employees to be good.
Corporate Offices
 Our corporate office is located at 1331 Lamar Street, Suite 650, Houston, Texas 77010, where we lease 24,675 square feet. Additionally, we lease 7,002 square feet of office space in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
