General 
 Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated and consolidated subsidiaries (SYKES, our, us or we) is a leading provider of multichannel demand generation and global customer engagement services. SYKES provides differentiated full lifecycle customer engagement solutions and services to Global 2000 companies and their end customers primarily in the communications, financial services, technology, transportation and leisure, healthcare, retail and other industries. Our differentiated full lifecycle management services platform effectively engages customers at every touchpoint within the customer journey, including digital marketing and acquisition, sales expertise, customer service, technical support and retention. We serve our clients through two geographic operating regions: the Americas (United States, Canada, Latin America, Australia and the Asia Pacific Rim) and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa). Our Americas and EMEA regions primarily provide customer engagement solutions and services with an emphasis on inbound multichannel demand generation, customer service and technical support to our clients customers. These services are delivered through multiple communication channels including phone, e-mail, social media, text messaging, chat and digital self-service. We also provide various enterprise support services in the United States that include services for our clients internal support operations, from technical staffing services to outsourced corporate help desk services. In Europe, we also provide fulfillment services, which include order processing, payment processing, inventory control, product delivery and product returns handling.

 U.S. 2017 Tax Reform Act 
 On December 20, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Reform Act) was approved by Congress and received presidential approval on December 22, 2017. In general, the 2017 Tax Reform Act reduces the United States (U.S.) corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective in 2018. The 2017 Tax Reform Act moves from a worldwide business taxation approach to a participation exemption regime. The 2017 Tax Reform Act also imposes base-erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings of U.S. entities, as well as a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated non-U.S. earnings. The 2017 Tax Reform Act will have an impact on our consolidated financial results beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017, the period of enactment. 
 Acquisitions 
 In May 2017, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of a Global 2000 telecommunications service provider (the Telecommunications Asset acquisition), pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, dated April 24, 2017. We have reflected the Telecommunications Asset acquisitions operating results in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations since May 31, 2017. 
 In April 2016, we completed the acquisition of Clear Link Holdings, LLC (Clearlink), pursuant to a definitive agreement and plan of merger, dated March 6, 2016. We have reflected Clearlinks operating results in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations since April 1, 2016.

Industry Overview 
 The customer engagement solutions and services industry  which includes services such as digital marketing and demand generation, customer acquisition, customer support and customer retention  is highly fragmented and significant in size. According to Ovum, an industry research firm, the total number of individuals, or agent positions, working in the customer engagement services industry worldwide was estimated at roughly 9.5 million in 2017. With approximately 81% of the customer engagement work done by in-house engagement centers, the number of agent positions working for outsourcers, such as SYKES, was estimated at 1.8 million in 2017. The outsourced and total agent positions are forecasted by Ovum to grow at a rate of 1.0% and 1.0%, respectively, from 2017 to 2018. It is estimated that no single outsourcer has more than five percent of the total agent positions worldwide. Measured in dollar terms, the size of the outsourced portion of the customer engagement solutions and services industry worldwide was estimated at approximately $82 billion in 2017, according to Everest Group, an industry research firm. Everest Group also estimates that the outsourced portion of the customer engagement solutions and services industry is expected to grow to approximately $85 billion by 2018, a growth rate of 4.0% from 2017 to 2018. The 2017-2018 growth data measured in dollar terms is extrapolated from Everest Groups estimated compound growth projection of 4.0% for the industry from 2017 to 2020. 
 We believe that growth for broader outsourced customer engagement solutions and services will be fueled by the trend of Global 2000 companies and medium-sized businesses utilizing outsourcers. In todays marketplace, companies increasingly are seeking a comprehensive suite of innovative full lifecycle customer engagement management solutions and services that allow them to acquire customers, enhance the end users experience with their products and services, strengthen and enhance their company brands, maximize the lifetime value of their customers through retention and up-sell and cross-sell, efficiently and effectively deliver human interactions when and where customers value it most, and deploy best-in-class customer management strategies, processes and technologies. However, a myriad of factors, among them intense global competition, pricing pressures, softness in the global economy and rapid changes in technology, continue to make it difficult for companies to cost-effectively maintain the in-house personnel necessary to handle all of their customer engagement needs. 
 To address these needs, we offer multichannel demand generation and comprehensive global customer engagement solutions and services that leverage brick-and-mortar and at-home agent delivery infrastructure as well as digital self-service capabilities. We provide consistent high-value support for our clients customers across the globe in a multitude of languages, leveraging our dynamic, secure communications infrastructure and our global footprint that reaches across 21 countries. This global footprint includes established brick-and-mortar operations in both onshore and offshore geographies where companies have access to high-quality customer engagement solutions at lower costs compared to other markets. We further complement our brick-and-mortar global delivery model with a highly differentiated and ready-made best-in-class at-home agent delivery model. In addition, we provide digital self-service customer support that differentiates our go-to-market strategy as it expands options for companies to best service their customers in their channel of choice to deliver an effortless customer experience. By working in partnership with outsourcers, companies can ensure that the crucial task of acquiring, growing and retaining their customer base is addressed while creating operating flexibility, enabling focus on their core competencies, ensuring service excellence and execution, achieving cost savings through a variable cost structure, leveraging scale, entering niche markets speedily, and efficiently allocating capital within their organizations. 
 Business Strategy 
 Broadly speaking, our value proposition to our clients is that of a trusted partner, which provides a comprehensive suite of differentiated full lifecycle multichannel demand generation and global customer engagement solutions and services to Global 2000 companies that drive customer acquisition, differentiation, brand loyalty and increased lifetime value of end customer relationships. By outsourcing their customer acquisition and service solutions to us, clients are able to achieve designs of exceptional customer experience and drive tangible business impact with greater operational flexibility, enhanced revenues, lower operating costs and faster speed to market, all of which are at the center of our value proposition. At a tactical level, we deliver on this value proposition through consistent delivery of operational and client excellence. Our business strategy is to leverage this value proposition in order to 
 
4 
 
 capitalize on and increase our share of the large and underpenetrated addressable market opportunity for customer engagement solutions and services worldwide. We believe through successful execution of our business strategy, we could generate a healthy level of revenue growth and drive targeted long-term operating margins. To deliver on our long-term growth potential and operating margin objectives, we need to manage the key levers of our business strategy, the principles of which include the following: 
 Build Long-Term Client Relationships Through Customer Service Excellence. We believe that providing high-value, high-quality service is critical in our clients decisions to outsource and in building long-term relationships with our clients. To ensure service excellence and consistency across each of our centers globally, we leverage a portfolio of techniques, including SYKES Science of Service®. This standard is a compilation of more than 30 years of experience and best practices. Every customer engagement center strives to meet or exceed the standard, which addresses leadership, hiring and training, performance management down to the agent level, forecasting and scheduling, and the client relationship including continuous improvement, disaster recovery plans and feedback. 
 Increasing Share of Seats Within Existing Clients and Winning New Clients. We provide customer engagement solutions and services to Global 2000 companies. With this large target market, we have the opportunity to grow our client base. We strive to achieve this by winning a greater share of our clients in-house seats as well as gaining share from our competitors by providing consistently high-quality service as clients continue to consolidate their vendor base. In addition, as we further integrate the recently-acquired digital marketing, demand generation and customer acquisition or sales conversion capabilities of Clearlink and leverage it across our brick-and-mortar and at-home agent delivery platforms both domestically and internationally within our vertical markets mix, we plan to win new clients as a way to broaden our base of growth. 
 Diversifying Verticals and Expanding Service Lines. To mitigate the impact of any negative economic and product cycles on our growth rate, we continue to seek ways to diversify into verticals and service lines that have countercyclical features and healthy growth rates. We are targeting the following verticals for growth: communications, financial services, technology/consumer, healthcare, transportation and leisure, and other, which includes retail. These verticals cover various business lines, including wireless services, broadband, media, retail banking, peer-to-peer lending, credit card/consumer fraud protection, gaming, consumer and high-end enterprise tech support, telemedicine and soft and hard goods online and through brick and mortar retailers. 
 Maximizing Capacity Utilization Rates and Strategically Adding Seat Capacity. Revenues and profitability growth are driven by increasing the capacity utilization rate in conjunction with seat capacity additions. We plan to sustain our focus on increasing the capacity utilization rate by further penetrating existing clients, adding new clients and rationalizing underutilized seat capacity as deemed necessary. With greater operating flexibility resulting from our at-home agent delivery model, we believe we can rationalize underutilized capacity more efficiently and drive capacity utilization rates. 
 Broadening At-Home Agent and Brick-and-Mortar Global Delivery Footprint. Just as increased capacity utilization rates and increased seat capacity are key drivers of our revenues and profitability growth, where we deploy both the seat capacity and the at-home agent delivery platform geographically is also important. By broadening and continuously strengthening our brick-and-mortar global delivery footprint and our at-home agent delivery platform, we believe we are able to meet both our existing and new clients customer engagement needs globally as they enter new markets. At the end of 2017, our global delivery brick-and-mortar footprint spanned 21 countries while our at-home agent delivery platform was recently launched in EMEA, building on our existing presence in 40 states and ten provinces within the U.S. and Canada, respectively. 
 Creating Value-Added Service Enhancements. To improve both revenue and margin expansion, we intend to continue to introduce new service offerings and add-on enhancements. Digital marketing and demand generation, multilingual customer support, digital self-service support and back office services are examples of horizontal service offerings, while data analytics and process improvement products are examples of add-on enhancements. Additionally, with the proliferation of on-line communities, such as Facebook and Twitter, we continue to make on-going investments in our social media service offerings, which can be leveraged across both our brick-and-mortar and at-home agent delivery platforms. 
 Continuing to Focus on Expanding the Addressable Market Opportunities. As part of our growth strategy, we continually seek to expand the number of markets we serve. The United States, Canada and Germany, for instance, are markets which are served by in-country centers, centers in offshore regions or a combination thereof. We continually seek ways to broaden the addressable market for our customer engagement services. We currently 
 
5 
 
 operate in 14 markets. 
 Continue to Grow Our Business Organically, through Strategic Investments and Partnerships, and through Acquisitions. We have grown our customer engagement solutions and services utilizing a combination of internal organic growth, strategic investments and partnerships, and external acquisitions. Our organic growth, partnership and acquisition strategies are to target markets, clients, verticals, delivery geographies and service mix that will expand our addressable market opportunity, and thus drive our organic growth. Entry into The Philippines, El Salvador, Romania and Colombia are examples of how we leveraged these delivery geographies to further penetrate our base of both existing and new clients, verticals and service mix in order to drive organic growth. While the Alpine Access, Inc. (Alpine), Qelp and Clearlink acquisitions are examples of how we used acquisitions to augment our service offerings and differentiate our delivery model, the ICT Group, Inc. (ICT) acquisition is an example of how we used an acquisition to gain overall size and critical mass in key verticals, clients and geographies. In 2017, we also made a strategic investment of $10.0 million in XSell Technologies, Inc. (XSell) for 32.8% of XSells preferred stock. XSell optimizes the sales performance capabilities of a broader base of agents as compared to what has historically been an extremely narrow base by leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. As customer contact programs increasingly incorporate up-selling and cross-selling, and measures based on sales conversion, XSells targeted offering can be leveraged across both chat and voice channels, across traditional customer contact management opportunities, and the Clearlink platform to enhance sales performance and conversion on behalf of our clients. 
 Services 
 We specialize in providing differentiated full lifecycle customer engagement solutions and services to Global 2000 companies and their end customers at key touchpoints a global basis. These services include digital marketing, demand generation, customer acquisition, customer support, technical support, up-sell/cross-sell and retention. Our comprehensive customer engagement solutions and services are provided through two reportable segments  the Americas and EMEA. The Americas region, representing 83.6% of consolidated revenues in 2017, includes the United States, Canada, Latin America, Australia and the Asia Pacific Rim. The sites within Latin America and the Asia Pacific Rim are included in the Americas region as they provide a significant service delivery vehicle for U.S.-based companies that are utilizing our customer engagement solutions and services in these locations to support their customer care needs. In addition, the Americas region also includes revenues from our at-home agent delivery solution, which serves markets in both the U.S. and Canada. The EMEA region, representing 16.4% of consolidated revenues in 2017, includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa. See Note 25, Segments and Geographic Information, of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our segments. The following is a description of our customer engagement solutions and services: 
 Outsourced Customer Engagement Solutions and Services. Our outsourced customer engagement solutions and services represented approximately 99.4% of total 2017 consolidated revenues. Each year, we handle over 250 million customer engagements including phone, e-mail, social media, text messaging, chat and digital self-service support throughout the Americas and EMEA regions. We provide these services utilizing our advanced technology infrastructure, human resource management skills and industry experience. These services include: 

● | Customer care  Customer care contacts primarily include handling billing inquiries and claims, activating customer accounts, resolving complaints, cross-selling/up-selling, prequalifying and warranty management, providing health information and dispatching roadside assistance;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Technical support  Technical support contacts primarily include support around complex networks, hardware and software, communications equipment, Internet access technology and Internet portal usage; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Customer acquisition  Our customer acquisition services are focused around digital marketing, multichannel demand generation, in-bound up-selling and sales conversion, as well as some outbound selling of our clients products and services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We provide these services, primarily inbound customer calls, in many languages through our extensive global network of customer engagement centers. In addition, we augment those in-bound calls with the option of digital self-service customer support. Our technology infrastructure and managed service solutions allow for effective distribution of calls to one or more centers. These technology offerings provide our clients and us with the leading edge tools needed to maximize quality and customer satisfaction while controlling and minimizing costs.

Fulfillment Services. In Europe, we offer fulfillment services that are integrated with our customer care and technical support services. Our fulfillment solutions include order processing via the Internet and phone, inventory control, product delivery and product returns handling. 
 Enterprise Support Services. In the United States, we provide a range of enterprise support services including technical staffing services and outsourced corporate help desk solutions. 
 Operations 
 Customer Engagement Centers. We operate across 21 countries in 79 customer engagement centers, which breakdown as follows: 23 centers across EMEA, 28 centers in the United States, three centers in Canada, three centers in Australia and 22 centers offshore, including the Peoples Republic of China, The Philippines, Costa Rica, El Salvador, India, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia. In addition to our customer engagement centers, we employ approximately 4,900 at-home customer engagement agents across 40 states in the U.S. and across ten provinces in Canada. 
 We utilize a sophisticated workforce management system to provide efficient scheduling of personnel. Our internally developed digital private communications network complements our workforce by allowing for effective call volume management and disaster recovery backup. Through this network and our dynamic intelligent call routing capabilities, we can rapidly respond to changes in client call volumes and move call volume traffic based on agent availability and skill throughout our network of centers, improving the responsiveness and productivity of our agents. We also can offer cost competitive solutions for taking calls to our offshore locations. 
 Our data warehouse captures and downloads customer engagement information for reporting on a daily, real-time and historical basis. This data provides our clients with direct visibility into the services that we are providing for them. The data warehouse supplies information for our performance management systems such as our agent scorecarding application, which provides us with the information required for effective management of our operations. 
 Our customer engagement centers are protected by a fire extinguishing system, backup generators with significant capacity and 24 hour refueling contracts and short-term battery backups in the event of a power outage, reduced voltage or a power surge. Rerouting of call volumes to other customer engagement centers is also available in the event of a telecommunications failure, natural disaster or other emergency. Security measures are imposed to prevent unauthorized physical access. Software and related data files are backed up daily and stored off site at multiple locations. We carry business interruption insurance covering interruptions that might occur as a result of certain types of damage to our business. 
 Fulfillment Centers. We currently have one fulfillment center located in Europe. We provide our fulfillment services primarily to certain clients operating in Europe who desire this complementary service in connection with outsourced customer engagement services. 
 Enterprise Support Services Office. Our enterprise support services office, located in a metropolitan area in the United States, provides recruitment services for high-end knowledge workers, a local presence to service major accounts, and outsourced corporate help desk solutions. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales and marketing objective is to leverage our vertical expertise, global presence, and end-to-end lifecycle of service offerings to develop long-term relationships with existing and future clients. Our customer engagement solutions have been developed to help our clients market, acquire, retain and increase the lifetime value of their customer relationships. Our plans for increasing our visibility and impacting the market include the launch of new service offerings in digital support and digital marketing, participation in market-specific industry associations, trade shows and seminars, digital and content marketing to industry leading corporations, and consultative personal visits and solution designs. We research and publish thought provoking perspectives on key industry issues, and use forums, speaking engagements, articles and white papers, as well as our website and broad global digital and social media presence to establish our leadership position in the market. 
 Our sales force is composed of business development managers who pursue new business opportunities and strategic account managers who manage and grow relationships with existing accounts. We emphasize account development 
 
7 
 
 to strengthen relationships with existing clients. Business development management and strategic account managers are assigned to markets in their area of expertise in order to develop a complete understanding of each clients particular needs, to form strong client relationships and encourage cross-selling of our other service offerings. We have inside customer sales representatives who receive customer inquiries and who provide pre-sales relationship development for the business development managers. Utilizing best practices from our recent Clearlink acquisition, we are employing modern methods of search and digital marketing to cultivate interest in our brand and services. We use a methodical approach to collecting client feedback through quarterly business reviews, annual strategic reviews, and through our bi-annual Voice of the Client program, which enables us to react to early warning signs, and quickly identify and remedy challenges. It also is used to highlight our most loyal clients, who we then work with to provide references, testimonials and joint speaking engagements at industry conferences. 
 As part of our marketing efforts, we invite existing and potential clients to experience our customer engagement centers and at-home agent delivery operations, where we can demonstrate the expertise of our skilled staff in partnering to deliver new ways of growing clients revenues, customer satisfaction and retention rates, and thus profit, through timely, insightful and proven solutions. This forum allows us to demonstrate our capabilities to design, launch and scale programs. It also allows us to illustrate our best innovations in talent management, analytics, and digital channels, and how they can be best integrated into a programs design. 
 Clients 
 We provide service to clients from our locations in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Australia, the Asia Pacific Rim, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. These clients are Global 2000 corporations, medium-sized businesses and public institutions, which span the communications, financial services, technology/consumer, transportation and leisure, healthcare and other industries. Revenue by industry vertical for 2017, as a percentage of our consolidated revenues, was 33% for communications, 27% for financial services, 18% for technology/consumer, 7% for transportation and leisure, 4% for healthcare, 3% for retail and 8% for all other verticals, including government and utilities. We believe our globally recognized client base presents opportunities for further cross marketing of our services. 
 Total revenues by segment from AT&T Corporation, a major provider of communication services for which we provide various customer support services, were as follows (in thousands): 
 

 | Years Ended December 31, | | | 
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | | 2015 | | | 
 | Amount | | | % ofRevenues | | Amount | | | % ofRevenues | Amount | | % of Revenues | 
Americas | $ | 220,010 | | | 16.6% | | $ | 239,033 | | 19.6% | | $ | 217,449 | 20.8%
EMEA | | - | | | 0.0% | | | - | | 0.0% | | | 3,003 | 1.2% 
 | $ | 220,010 | | | 13.9% | | $ | 239,033 | | 16.4 | % | $ | 220,452 | 17.1%

 We have multiple distinct contracts with AT&T spread across multiple lines of businesses, which expire at varying dates between 2018 and 2019. We have historically renewed most of these contracts. However, there is no assurance that these contracts will be renewed, or if renewed, will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts. Each line of business is governed by separate business terms, conditions and metrics. Each line of business also has a separate decision maker such that a loss of one line of business would not necessarily impact our relationship with the client and decision makers on other lines of business. The loss of (or the failure to retain a significant amount of business with) any of our key clients, including AT&T, could have a material adverse effect on our performance. Many of our contracts contain penalty provisions for failure to meet minimum service levels and are cancelable by the client at any time or on short notice. Also, clients may unilaterally reduce their use of our services under our contracts without penalty.

 Our top ten clients accounted for approximately 46.9%, 49.2% and 48.5% of our consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Competition 
 The industry in which we operate is global, highly fragmented and extremely competitive. While many companies provide customer engagement solutions and services, we believe no one company is dominant in the industry. 
 In most cases, our principal competition stems from our existing and potential clients in-house customer engagement operations. When it is not the in-house operations of a client or potential client, our public and private direct competition includes 24/7 Customer, Alorica, Arise, Atento, Concentrix, Convergys, Groupe Acticall/Sitel, iQor, LiveOps, StarTek, Sutherland, Teleperformance, TTEC, Transcom and Working Solutions, as well as the customer care arm of such companies as Accenture, Conduent, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Wipro, among others. There are other numerous and varied providers of such services, including firms specializing in various CRM consulting, other customer engagement solutions providers, niche or large market companies, as well as product distribution companies that provide fulfillment services. Some of these companies possess substantially greater resources, greater name recognition and a more established customer base than we do. 
 We believe that the most significant competitive factors in the sale of outsourced customer engagement services include service quality, tailored value-added service offerings, industry experience, advanced technological capabilities, global coverage, reliability, scalability, security, price and financial strength. As a result of intense competition, outsourced customer engagement solutions and services frequently are subject to pricing pressure. Clients also require outsourcers to be able to provide services in multiple locations. Competition for contracts for many of our services takes the form of competitive bidding in response to requests for proposal. 
 Intellectual Property 
 The success of our business depends, in part, on our proprietary technology and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual arrangements to protect our intellectual property. We and our subsidiaries have registered various trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and/or other countries, including SYKES®, REAL PEOPLE. REAL SOLUTIONS®, SYKES HOME®, SYKES HOME POWERED BY ALPINE ACCESS®, SCIENCE OF SERVICE®, ALPINE ACCESS®, ALPINE ACCESS UNIVERSITY®, TALENTSPROUT®, SECURE TALK®, CLEARLINK®, BUYCALLS®, A SECURE LIFE®, LEADAMP®, TRUE PROTECT®, BROADBANDEXPERT®, SAFEWISE® and USDIRECT®. The duration of trademark and service mark registrations varies from country to country but may generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the marks are in use and their registrations are properly maintained. We have a pending U.S. patent application which relates to a system and method of analysis and recommendation for distributed employee management and digital collaboration. We also have a pending U.S. patent application that relates to systems and methods for secure 
 
9 
 
 authentication to computer networks and visual work environment setup. Our subsidiary, Alpine, was issued U.S. Patent No. 8,565,413 in 2013, which relates to a system and method for establishment and management of a remote agent engagement center. Alpine was also issued U.S. Patent No. 9,100,484 in 2015, which relates to a secure call environment. 
 Employees 
 As of January 31, 2018, we had approximately 55,000 employees worldwide, including 43,675 customer engagement agents handling technical and customer support inquiries at our centers, 4,900 at-home customer engagement agents handling technical and customer support inquiries, 6,300 in management, administration, information technology, finance, sales and marketing roles, 25 in enterprise support services and 100 in fulfillment services. Our employees, with the exception of approximately 400 employees in Brazil and various European countries, are not union members and we have never suffered a material interruption of business as a result of a labor dispute. We consider our relations with our employees worldwide to be satisfactory. 
 We employ personnel through a continually updated recruiting network. This network includes a seasoned team of recruiters, competency-based selection standards and the sharing of global best practices in order to advertise to and source qualified candidates through proven recruiting techniques. Nonetheless, demand for qualified professionals with the required language and technical skills may still exceed supply at times as new skills are needed to keep pace with the requirements of customer engagements. As such, competition for such personnel is intense. Additionally, employee turnover in our industry is high.
