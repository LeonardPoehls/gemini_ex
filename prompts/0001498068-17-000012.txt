     Item 1. Business. 
     Overview
     We are the largest dialysis services provider in the United States focused exclusively on joint venture (“JV”) partnerships with physicians. As of December 31, 2016, we owned and operated 214 dialysis clinics in partnership with 379 nephrologist partners treating over 14,000 patients in 25 states and the District of Columbia. 
     We operate our dialysis clinics exclusively through a JV model, in which we partner primarily with local nephrologists to develop, own and operate dialysis clinics, while the providers of the majority of dialysis services in the United States operate through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. Each of our clinics is maintained as a separate joint venture in which generally we have the controlling interest and our nephrologist partners and other joint venture partners have a noncontrolling interest. As of December 31, 2016, on average we held 53% of the interests in our clinics and our nephrologist partners held 47% of the interests. We believe our JV model, combined with a high‑quality operational infrastructure, provides our physician partners the independence to make improved clinical decisions so they can focus on maximizing patient care and grow their clinical practices.
     We provide high‑quality patient care and clinical outcomes to patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The loss of kidney function is normally irreversible. Kidney failure is typically caused by Type I and Type II diabetes, high blood pressure, polycystic kidney disease, long-term autoimmune attack on the kidney and prolonged urinary tract obstruction. ESRD is the stage of advanced kidney impairment that requires continued dialysis treatments or a kidney transplant to sustain life. Dialysis is the removal of toxins, fluids and salt from the blood of patients by artificial means. Patients suffering from ESRD generally require dialysis at least three times a week for the rest of their lives.
     According to United States Renal Data System, there were approximately 475,000 ESRD dialysis patients in the U.S. in 2014. The ESRD dialysis patient population has grown at an approximate compound rate of 3.8% from 2000 to 2014, the latest period for which such data is available. The growth rate is attributable to the aging of the population, increased incidence rates for diseases that cause kidney failure such as diabetes and hypertension, lower mortality rates for dialysis patients and growth rates of minority populations with higher than average incidence rates of ESRD.
     Our core values create a culture of clinical autonomy and operational accountability for our physician partners and staff members. We believe our joint venture model has helped us become one of the fastest‑growing national dialysis services platforms, in terms of the growth rate of our non‑acquired treatments since 2012. We believe our approach has attracted physician partners and facilitated the expansion of our platform through de novo clinics.
     Since 2012, we have opened 15 or more de novo clinics each year. From 2012 to 2016, our total number of treatments grew at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 14.3%, driven primarily by increases in non‑acquired treatments, which grew at a CAGR of 11.6%. During the same period, our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA‑NCI to us have grown at a CAGR of 15.6% and 10.8%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our revenues, Adjusted EBITDA‑NCI and net loss attributable to us reached $756.3 million, $123.6 million and ($0.4) million, respectively.
     For definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA‑NCI and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA‑NCI to net income (loss), see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

 Effectiveness of our JV Model in Delivering High Performance
     We meet or exceed the core measures established by CMS to promote high‑quality services in outpatient dialysis facilities. As an example, we have demonstrated strong performance in the ESRD Quality Incentive Program (“QIP”), which changes the way CMS pays for the treatment of patients with ESRD by linking a portion of payment directly to facilities’ performance on CMS core measures. The ESRD QIP reduces future payments to dialysis facilities that do not meet or exceed certain performance standards. The maximum payment reduction CMS can apply to any facility is 2% of all payments for services performed by the facility in a given year. Since the inception of the QIP program in 2010, the impact of payment reductions on our revenues has not exceeded 0.1% of our revenues in any year. According to data recently released by CMS, only 10.9% of ARA’s dialysis facilities received payment reductions under the ESRD QIP for measurement year 2015 (payment year 2017) as compared to 19.4% for the industry overall. Based on our performance in measurement years 2015, 2014 and 2013, our clinics have consistently performed above national averages with our QIP Total Performance Score in measurement year 2015 of 70 compared to the national average of 68, our QIP Total Performance Score in measurement year 2014 of 76 compared to the national average of 73 and our QIP Total Performance Score in measurement year 2013 of 84 compared to the national average of 81. We believe our performance is driven by a culture of compliance and the advantages of our JV model.
     Premier Brand Recognition and Alignment of Interests Makes ARA a Preferred Partner for Nephrologists
     We believe that the ARA brand has a strong reputation and widespread recognition in the industry. We believe that our premier brand has been and will continue to be a key factor in our success. This reputation has been built since our inception, backed by the performance and success of our nephrologists and clinical staff. Our brand is further associated with high‑quality care as evidenced by our clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction levels, and physician satisfaction scores. According to the most recent Press Ganey survey, 98% of the 144 physicians who responded to the survey agreed or strongly agreed that our clinics provide high‑quality care and service (with the remaining 2% giving neutral responses). Our exclusive focus on the JV model combined with our premium brand recognition afford us high success rates in partnering with nephrologists interested in pursuing a JV model.
     Our nephrologists appreciate the quality of our dialysis clinics, best practices management services and solid track record of clinical and regulatory compliance. To date, none of our physician partners has voluntarily left us to join a competitor or terminated a partnership. Further, by owning a portion of the clinics where their patients are treated, our physician partners have a vested stake in the quality, reputation and performance of the clinics.
     We believe our JV model drives growth by enabling our physician partners to reinvest in their practices and develop their practices by adding new nephrologists, which provides us with the opportunity to expand existing clinics or add new clinics. According to the Press Ganey survey, 96% of the responding physicians agreed or strongly agreed that they have adequate input into clinic decisions that affect their practices and 96% agreed or strongly agreed that they had confidence in ARA leadership (with the remaining 4% giving neutral responses). Our physician partners’ satisfaction leads to positive references and new physician recommendations within the broader nephrology community, thereby enhancing our ability to partner with leading, established nephrologists. According to the Press Ganey survey, 99% of the responding physicians agreed or strongly agreed that they would recommend our clinics to other physicians and medical staff as a good place to practice medicine (with the remaining 1% giving neutral responses).
     Proven De Novo Clinic Model Drives Predictable Market Leading Organic Growth
     We have primarily grown through de novo clinic development. We have developed a streamlined approach to opening clinics that results in competitive return on invested capital for both our company and our physician partners. As of December 31, 2016, we had a portfolio of 163 clinics developed as de novo clinics. Since 2012, we have opened 15 or more de novo clinics each year.
     Highly competitive de novo clinic economics. A typical de novo clinic is 8,000 to 9,000 square feet, has 15 to 20 dialysis stations (performing approximately 10,000 to 11,000 annual treatments on average) and requires approximately $1.3 to $1.7 million of capital for equipment purchases, leasehold improvements and initial working capital. A portion of this required capital is typically equity capital funded by us and our nephrologist partners in proportion to our respective ownership interests, and the balance of such development cost is typically funded through third‑party loans that we and our nephrologist partners guarantee on a basis proportionate to our respective ownership interests.

     We have a long track record of achieving positive clinic‑level monthly EBITDA within, on average, six months after the first treatment at a clinic. The consistent historical growth of each year’s class of de novo clinics attests to the success of our de novo model. For example, eight de novo clinics opened in 2010 generated an average revenue of $2.3 million per clinic in their first year, which grew to $3.8 million per clinic in their second year and $4.4 million per clinic in their third year (a three‑year CAGR of approximately 38%); 12 de novo clinics opened in 2011 generated an average revenue of $1.4 million per clinic in their first year, which grew to $2.8 million per clinic in their second year and $3.1 million per clinic in their third year (a three‑year CAGR of approximately 47%); 16 de novo clinics opened in 2012 generated an average revenue of $1.7 million per clinic in their first year, which grew to $3.0 million per clinic in their second year and $3.4 million per clinic in their third year  (a three‑year CAGR of approximately 41%); 17 de novo clinics opened in 2013 generated an average revenue of $1.8 million per clinic in their first year, which grew to $2.9 million per clinic in their second year and $3.6 million per clinic in their third year (a three-year CAGR of approximately 41%); and 15 de novo clinics opened in 2014 generated an average revenue of $1.6 million per clinic in their first year which grew to $3.7 million per clinic in their second year; and 16 de novo clinics opened in 2015 generated an average revenue of $2.2 million per clinic in their first year.
     Robust business development efforts to maintain momentum of signing de novo clinics. Our successful track record helps us attract new nephrologists and maintain an active pipeline of de novo clinics to be opened in the near future. We frequently receive inquiries from nephrologists seeking to partner with us as a result of recommendations from our existing nephrologist partners or based on our brand recognition and reputation in the nephrologist community. Our senior management consistently meets with high‑quality lead nephrologists and engages them in discussions regarding benefits of partnering with us. This affords us the opportunity to selectively partner with the most qualified and credentialed physicians. At any given time, we have an active roster of nephrologists, including existing physician partners, seeking to open clinics within the next twelve months.
     We refer to clinics for which a medical director agreement, an operating agreement and a management services agreement have been signed as our “signed de novo clinics.” On average, our signed de novo clinics begin serving patients within 15 months of signing of the agreements. From that point, a clinic may take approximately two to three years to achieve the stabilized revenue initially projected for that clinic. As of December 31, 2015, we had 32 signed de novo clinics and 17 of such clinics were opened as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had 33 signed de novo clinics, which are scheduled to be opened in 2017 and 2018.
     Our track record of opening signed clinics within a predictable timeline and ability to maintain momentum of signing de novo clinics has helped us sustain our industry‑leading growth rates in terms of percentage growth in non‑acquired treatments.
     Innovative and Experienced Management Team with a Proven Track Record
     Our management team is among the most experienced in the dialysis services industry. Our executives, including our two founders, have on average 24 years of professional experience in the dialysis services industry while our two founding executives collectively have on average 38 years of professional experience in the dialysis services industry. Our two founding executives and other senior management firmly believe in the advantages of the JV model and the importance of attracting, developing and retaining skilled staff at our clinics, and they endeavor to continue to build our company on these founding philosophies. Most of our executive and senior management have held multiple positions with one or more of our competitors and have contacts throughout the dialysis services industry with physicians, clinical staff, payors, vendors and other parties. Our executive leadership is supported by an experienced team of regional vice presidents who maintain a hands‑on approach and are focused on the success of each local clinic in their respective markets. This breadth and depth of experience gives our management team the knowledge and resources to more effectively manage relations with physician partners and other personnel, enhance operating results and promote growth.     Our Growth Strategy
     We believe our focus on the JV model, our core values and the strength of our experienced management team have driven the growth in our patient population and physician relationships, and position us to execute on the following growth strategies.

 Partner with High‑Quality Nephrologists with Strong Local Market Reputation and Patient Relationships
     We partner with nephrologists who are well‑qualified and have strong reputations and patient relationships in the local market. We have a well‑established protocol to evaluate the quality of a potential nephrologist partner. Our success to date, together with the opportunities provided by our JV model, make us an attractive partner for nephrologists, including those nephrologists whose contractual relationships as medical directors at our competitors’ clinics have expired. Further, our nephrologist partners also generate awareness and recognition of our company within the broader nephrology community and provide recommendations of potential new nephrologist partners physicians. Consequently, we have the opportunity to be selective when choosing our future physician partners.
     According to a report prepared for the American Society of Nephrology, there are over 10,000 full‑time practicing nephrologists in the United States. We believe that many of these physicians treat their patients at clinics in which they have no ownership and may be interested in partnering with us in a JV model. As of December 31, 2016, we have partnered with 379 of these nephrologists, or less than 4% of all full‑time practicing nephrologists, giving us significant opportunity to grow as a premier JV model operator within the nephrologist community.
     Grow Organically Through De Novo Clinics in New and Existing Markets and Expansion of Existing Clinics
     We intend to leverage our JV model and our reputation in the nephrology community to continue to develop de novo clinics in new as well as existing markets in the United States. Our nephrologist relationships and strong reputation in the industry allow us to maintain an active pipeline of de novo clinics to be opened in the near future, which we expect to drive continued growth in our non‑acquired treatments and non‑acquired revenues. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio included 163 clinics developed as de novo clinics.
     De novo clinics with new physician partners. We believe our strong brand reputation and widespread recognition in the closely knit nephrologist community give us an opportunity to attract new nephrologists as our physician partners and staff. We believe that patients choose to have their dialysis services at one of our clinics due to their relationship with our physician partners and staff, consistent high‑quality care, a comfortable patient care experience and convenience of location and available treatment times. Our de novo clinics showcase a core competence in building and operating de novo clinics that are supported by our best practice management services and grow predictably. The historical growth of these clinics provides evidence of the consistency and success of our de novo clinic model. Since 2012, we have opened 53 new clinics with new physician partners, representing approximately 63% of our de novo clinic openings.
     Additional clinics with existing physician partners. Our JV model provides our physician partners with opportunities to grow their individual or group practices within their local markets. The growth of our partners’ practices contributes to the development of additional clinics with existing partners as new JVs in the same geographic area. New clinics sometimes begin as smaller clinics under the common supervision of an existing clinic in the same market. Over time, these new clinics may grow to the same size as the original clinic, or they may continue to operate fewer shifts or otherwise offer services to a smaller patient base. In either case, new clinics allow us to increase our market share by serving new patients who may find the new clinic location more convenient, or by freeing up capacity at the larger clinic where existing patients may have previously sought treatment. Since 2012, we have opened 31 new clinics with existing physician partners in their respective local markets, representing approximately 37% of our de novo clinic openings.
     Expansion of capacity in existing clinics. Depending on demand and capacity utilization, we may have space within our existing clinics to accommodate a greater number of dialysis stations or operate additional shifts in order to increase patient volume without compromising our quality standards. Such expansions offer patients more flexibility in scheduling and leverage the fixed cost infrastructure of our existing clinics, which in turn provides high incremental returns on capital invested. We intend to continue to work with our physician partners to broaden our market share in existing markets by seeking opportunities to expand our treatment volume through expansion of existing clinics. From 2012 to 2016, we added 139 dialysis stations to our existing clinics, representing the equivalent of nearly eight de novo clinics or an average per year increase in capacity of 1.1%, which further enhance our non‑acquired treatment growth rate profile.

 Opportunistically Pursue Acquisitions
     We currently operate 51 clinics that we acquired and integrated with our JV model. Because the acquisition cost for an existing dialysis clinic is typically higher than the cost to develop a de novo clinic, we have a disciplined approach to acquiring existing dialysis clinics. Our acquisition strategy is primarily driven by the quality of the nephrologist in the market. We pursue acquisitions in situations where we believe the nephrologist could be a potential partner and where there is an attractive opportunity to enter a new market or expand within an existing market.
     Our disciplined acquisition strategy has yielded significant benefits. Since 2012, we have acquired 26 clinics, two of which were acquired in 2016. Under our JV model, we provide best practices management services such as incorporating the clinic into our revenue cycle management, helping physician partners expand their practices and improving the acquired clinic’s cost structure including for laboratory testing, medical supplies, medications and services. As a result, the profitability of these clinics is typically improved. Clinics that we have acquired before 2016 (for which we have data and have no prior relationship) have, on average, increased revenue in the twelve months following acquisition by approximately 30% over the prior twelve‑month period.
     We intend to continue to opportunistically pursue acquisitions of clinics with reputations for quality and service. In making these acquisitions, we intend to integrate the ownership of the acquired clinic with our JV model. In addition, from time to time, we may evaluate the acquisition of existing dialysis clinic operators that have implemented a JV model similar to ours.
     Deliver on Our Core Values with Best Practices Management Services
     We intend to continue to focus on providing high‑quality patient care, clinical autonomy to physicians and extensive professional, operational and managerial support to our clinics through management services arrangements. Based on our experience in the dialysis services industry, we will continue to follow a disciplined approach to enhancing performance in key areas such as: revenue cycle management; patient registration; facilitation and verification of insurance; payor interaction and arrangements; and billing and collection. We believe this has positively impacted our revenue per treatment and allowed us to maintain low levels of days’ sales outstanding and bad debt expense. In addition, we believe our management services reduce the burden of back‑office management responsibilities associated with the daily operations of a dialysis clinic and enable our physician partners to focus on providing high‑quality patient care. As a result, we consistently deliver high‑quality clinical outcomes.
     Our management team adheres to several core values that foster best practices which we believe set us apart from other companies in our industry. Since our inception we have placed a strong emphasis on attracting, developing and retaining skilled staff at our clinics. We provide our clinical staff with necessary resources, equipment and administrative support to perform their duties effectively, and we closely monitor our staff’s satisfaction levels, responsibilities and workloads. We believe this emphasis promotes staff satisfaction and helps us attract and retain skilled clinical personnel. We believe our low employee turnover helps improve our operating efficiency and clinical outcomes.
     As a result of our growth and the other competitive strengths outlined above, we are able to generate significant cash flows from the operation of our JV clinics. This cash flow enhances our financial flexibility and enables us to pursue our de novo clinic growth strategy. The cash flows generated by our JV clinics also enable us to make distributions to our physician partners so that they may reinvest in and continue to grow their practices.
     Our Clinics and Services
     We provide dialysis services for patients with ESRD, which is the end stage of advanced chronic kidney disease characterized by the irreversible loss of kidney function. ESRD patients require continued dialysis treatments or a kidney transplant to sustain life. Our clinics offer both in‑center and home dialysis options to meet the needs of patients.
     Our clinics primarily provide in‑center hemodialysis treatments and ancillary items and services. Hemodialysis typically lasts approximately 3.5 hours per treatment and is usually performed at least three times per week. Many of our clinics also offer services for dialysis patients who prefer and are able to receive either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis in their homes. Home‑based dialysis services consist of providing equipment and supplies, training, patient

monitoring, on‑call support services and follow‑up assistance. Registered nurses train patients and their families or other caregivers to perform either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis at home.
     We contract with third parties to provide ancillary services, such as laboratory testing and pharmacy services. We contract with a specialized laboratory to provide routine laboratory tests for dialysis and other physician‑prescribed laboratory tests for ESRD patients. These tests are performed to monitor a patient’s ESRD condition, including the adequacy of dialysis, as well as other medical conditions of the patient. We work with our laboratory partner to utilize information systems which provide information to physicians and staff members of the dialysis clinics regarding critical outcome indicators.
     We equip our clinics with technologically advanced dialysis equipment and amenities. Our clinics generally contain between 15 and 20 dialysis stations, one or more nurses’ stations, a patient waiting area, examination rooms, a supply room, a water treatment space to purify water used in hemodialysis treatments, staff work areas, offices and a staff lounge. Our clinics are also typically outfitted with amenities including heated massaging chairs, wireless internet and individual television sets.
     In addition to a medical director, each clinic has a clinic manager, typically a registered nurse, who supervises the day‑to‑day operations of the center and its staff. The staff of each clinic typically consists of registered nurses, patient care technicians, a social worker, a registered dietician, facility technical manager and other administrative and support personnel.
     Local nephrologists are a key factor in the success of our clinics. Caring for ESRD patients is typically the primary clinical activity of a nephrologist, although a nephrologist may have other clinical activities including the post‑surgical care of kidney transplant patients and the diagnosis, treatment and management of kidney disorders other than ESRD. An ESRD patient generally seeks treatment at a clinic where his or her nephrologist has privileges to admit patients. Nephrologists with privileges at our clinics typically include our nephrologist partners, as well as other nephrologists that apply for and receive practice privileges to treat their patients at our clinics. As of December 31, 2016, there were over 379 nephrologists (including our nephrologist partners) with privileges to practice at one or more of our clinics.
     Clinic Growth
     The number of our clinics and patients has consistently increased since our inception. The following table sets forth the number of our clinics and patients as of the end of, as well as the number of de novo clinics and acquired clinics added during, each of the years indicated below.
 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 | 2011 | 2010 | 2009 | 2008 | 2007 | 2006 | 2005 | 2004 | 2003 | 2002 | 2001

 Location and Capacity of Our Clinics
     As of December 31, 2016, we owned and operated 214 dialysis clinics treating patients in 25 states and the District of Columbia, each of which is consolidated in our financial statements. The locations of these clinics as of December 31, 2016 were as follows:
State | Clinics | State | Clinics | State | Clinics
Arizona | 1 | Indiana | 4 | Ohio | 17 
California | 5 | Kentucky | 7 | Pennsylvania | 15 
Colorado | 11 | Louisiana | 1 | Rhode Island | 9 
Connecticut | 3 | Maryland | 4 | South Carolina | 10 
Delaware | 2 | Massachusetts | 13 | Texas | 22 
Florida | 40 | Michigan | 4 | Virginia | 6 
Georgia | 18 | Missouri | 2 | Washington, D.C. | 2 
Idaho | 1 | New Jersey | 5 | Wisconsin | 1 
Illinois | 3 | New York | 8 | | 
 | | | | TOTAL | 214 

      We have developed our clinics in a manner that we believe promotes high‑quality patient care. We select the geographic area of the clinic locations based on the identification of well‑qualified nephrologist partners with whom we are interested in developing a clinic. In cooperation with our nephrologist partners, we select a specific location to maximize convenience to the patients based on demographic and other factors. Other considerations in identifying geographic areas and specific locations include:
    
Our business and operating model emphasize the following core values. | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | the availability and cost of qualified and skilled personnel, particularly nursing and technical staff;
 | the area’s demographics and population growth estimates; and 
 | state regulation of dialysis and healthcare services. 

      Some of our dialysis clinics may be operating at or near capacity. We continuously monitor our dialysis clinics as they are nearing capacity. If a clinic is approaching full capacity, we may accommodate additional patient volume through increased hours or days of operation, or, if additional space is available within an existing clinic, by adding dialysis stations, or we may open an additional clinic in that local area. Substantially all of our clinics lease their space on terms that we believe are customary in the industry. See “Item 2. Properties.” Opening of de novo clinics or expansion of existing clinics may be subject to review for state regulatory compliance, as well as those conditions relating to participation in the Medicare ESRD program. In states that require a certificate of need or clinic license, additional approvals would generally be necessary for development or expansion.
     Quality Care
     Our corporate management team promotes a patient‑ and physician‑focused corporate culture, among other founding philosophies. We believe our culture and founding principles improve the clinical outcomes and operating performance of our dialysis clinics and our clinics’ compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For example, we believe that our culture of compliance, implemented by facilitating internal compliance audits, compliance hotlines, HIPAA compliance safeguards, as well as through management services such as manuals, policies and procedures and training, has contributed to our clinics’ strong track record in regulatory matters.
     On a monthly basis, our medical directors and our chief medical officers review clinical outcomes on a clinic‑by‑clinic basis and plan for continuous improvement. Our clinical team works routinely with individual physicians, clinic managers, and dieticians in an effort to optimize clinical outcomes such as anemia management, adequacy of the dialysis treatment (Kt/V), nutrition (albumin levels), arterial venous fistula (AV fistula) and other important indicators. Based on the review of outcomes data, action plans, including clinical programs and educational offerings, are developed and implemented. We have created a clinical ladder system that is used to track key performance data and effect improvement. We believe this system encourages our staff to strive for excellence, thereby enhancing quality of care and improving patient outcomes.

 Erythropoietin‑stimulating agents (“ESAs”) and other pharmaceuticals
     Patients receiving dialysis are also typically administered one or more pharmaceuticals and supplements. Patients are commonly treated with a genetically engineered form of erythropoietin, a naturally occurring protein that stimulates the production of red blood cells, such as EPO and Aranesp. ESAs are used in connection with all forms of dialysis to treat anemia, a medical complication most ESRD patients experience. Anemia involves a shortage of oxygen‑carrying red blood cells. Because red blood cells bring oxygen to all the cells in the body, untreated anemia can cause severe fatigue, heart disorders, difficulty concentrating, reduced immune function and other problems. Anemia is common among renal patients, caused by insufficient erythropoietin, iron deficiency, repeated blood losses, and other factors. Patients are also commonly treated with vitamin D analogs and iron supplements. EPO and Aranesp are produced by a single manufacturer, Amgen, and any interruption of supply or product cost increases could adversely affect our operations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Changes in the availability and cost of ESAs and other pharmaceuticals could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition as well as our ability to care for patients” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If our suppliers are unable to meet our needs, if there are material price increases, or if we are unable to effectively access new technology, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.”
     Our Corporate Structure 
     American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings” and together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “its” and “our”) conducts its business exclusively through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, American Renal Holdings Inc. (“ARH”), and its operating subsidiaries. ARH was originally incorporated in Delaware in July 1999.  In May 2010, we were acquired by certain affiliates of Centerbridge Capital Partners, L.P. (together with such affiliates, “Centerbridge”) and certain members of management in a series of transactions (the “Acquisition”).  Holdings and its wholly-owned subsidiary, American Renal Holdings Intermediate Company, LLC, the direct parent of ARH, were incorporated and formed, respectively, in Delaware in March 2010 in anticipation of the Acquisition and to provide flexibility in structuring our debt financing in the future. 
     The primary asset of ARH is its ownership of 100% of the membership interests in American Renal Associates LLC (“ARA OpCo”).  ARA OpCo’s primary assets are its ownership interests in our operating clinic joint ventures.  ARA OpCo is also the direct parent of American Renal Management LLC, the subsidiary through which we conduct our management services for our joint ventures, including revenue cycle management, compliance and other back-office operations.
     Our Operating Structure
     Each of our clinics is maintained as a separate joint venture in which we have a controlling interest, and our nephrologist partners, who may be single practitioners, an affiliated group of nephrologists, hospitals or multi‑practice institutions, have the noncontrolling interest. As of December 31, 2016, on average we, through American Renal Associates LLC or another subsidiary, held 53% of the interests in our clinics and our nephrologist partners held 47% of the interests. Such noncontrolling interests may be held directly or indirectly through entities formed by affiliated groups of nephrologists. From time to time, we may purchase additional membership interests in our JVs. Some of our joint venture partners, in particular those partners consisting of affiliated groups of nephrologists, have interests in multiple clinics with us.  
     Each of our JVs is organized as a limited liability company or limited partnerships (other than one JV, which is a corporation), typically organized in either the State of Delaware or the state in which the clinics are located. Although the terms on which each JV is owned and operated vary to some extent, our JV arrangements have many common features. Agreements that we typically enter into in connection with our clinics include joint venture operating agreements, medical director agreements and management services agreements pursuant to which we provide various support services to our clinics. See “—JV Operating Agreements,” “—Medical Directors” and “—Management Services” below.
     Our relationships with physicians and other sources of recommendations for our joint ventures are required to comply with the federal anti‑kickback statute, among a variety of other state and federal laws and regulations. We believe our JV arrangements satisfy many but not all of the elements of the federal anti‑kickback statute safe harbors and may not meet all of the elements of analogous state safe harbors. Arrangements that do not meet all of the elements of a 

 
  12

 
safe harbor do not necessarily violate the federal anti‑kickback statute, but are susceptible to government scrutiny. We have endeavored to structure our JVs to satisfy as many safe harbor elements as reasonably possible. Investments in our JVs are offered on a fair market value basis and provide returns to the physician investors only in proportion to their actual investment in the venture. We believe that our agreements do not violate the federal anti‑kickback statute; however, since the arrangements do not satisfy all of the elements for safe harbor protection, these arrangements could be challenged. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our arrangements and relationships with our physician partners and medical directors do not satisfy all of the elements of safe harbors to the federal anti‑kickback statute and certain state anti‑kickback laws and, as a result, may subject us to government scrutiny or civil or criminal monetary penalties or require us to restructure such arrangements.” Additional risks relating to our JV operating model and the federal and state laws and regulations under which we operate are described under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
     JV Operating Agreements
     We typically enter into a joint venture operating agreement with our nephrologist partners and a management services agreement with the joint venture pursuant to which we provide various support services to our clinics. See “—Management Services” below. The JV operating agreements allocate ownership, rights and responsibilities in our clinics and provide, among other things, for:
Our business and operating model emphasize the following core values. | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | allocation and distribution of profits and losses; 
 | procedures and conditions for the sale of membership interests; 
 | voting procedures; and 
 | establishment of a managing committee, in order to control the business and affairs of the clinic.

      Typically, the ARA Member is entitled to appoint a majority of the members of such managing committee.
     Our JV operating agreements generally provide for unanimous or supermajority consent relating to certain major actions affecting the respective joint venture. Such actions typically include:
    
Our business and operating model emphasize the following core values. | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | a sale, transfer, liquidation or reorganization of all or substantially all of the clinic, or a merger or dissolution of the clinic;
 | a lease of all or substantially all of the clinic; 
 | the admission of a new or substituted member; 
 | an amendment or modification of the applicable operating agreement or the constituent documents for the clinic; 
 | certain transactions with affiliates; and 
 | any capital calls except to the extent specifically provided. 

      Some of our JV operating agreements provide for our supermajority or unanimous consent for certain other significant actions. Additionally, some of our JV operating agreements provide that if the ARA Member plans to establish a new dialysis clinic in a previously agreed to restricted area, the physician partners have the right to participate in the ownership and operation of such new dialysis clinic.
     A substantial number of our JV operating agreements grant our physician partners rights to require us to purchase their ownership interests, at fair market value, at certain set times or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. Our nephrologist partners in each JV are generally required to collectively maintain a minimum percentage, most commonly at least 20%, of the total outstanding membership interests in the clinic following the exercise of their put rights. Event‑based triggers of these rights in various JV operating agreements may include sale of assets, closure of the clinic, acquisitions over a certain dollar amount, departure of key executives and other events. Time‑based triggers give physician partners at certain of our clinics the option to require us to purchase previously agreed upon percentages of their ownership interests at certain set dates. The time when some of the time‑based put rights may be exercised was accelerated upon our initial public offering in 2016 and may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or a change of control.
    
 
  13

 

 In addition, if the ARA Member sells all or a portion of its interest in certain of our JVs to a third party, some of the physician partners have the right to participate in the sale on the same terms and conditions applicable to the ARA Member or may, in some instances, require the ARA Member to first offer to sell its interest to the JV members before it may sell to a third party. Most of our JV operating agreements also grant the JV or its members a right of first refusal, such that the selling member must first offer its interest to the JV and then to the other members before it may sell its interest to a third party.
     A limited number of our JV operating agreements do not exist in perpetuity, and give our physician partners the right to purchase all of the membership interests held by the ARA Member, at fair market value, within a specified period before a previously agreed to termination date, generally over 20 years. If such physician partners do not exercise such call right, the JV will dissolve in accordance with the provisions in the JV operating agreement unless all partners agree to continue the JV. Also, some of our JV operating agreements grant our physician partners the right to purchase a portion or all of the ARA Member’s membership interests in the JV upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, which may include sale or transfer of all or substantially all assets to a third party, merger and other change of control transactions, at a purchase price typically based, in part, on the transaction valuation.
     Generally, the JV operating agreements also provide the JV with the option to redeem all of the membership interests of a member if such member, including our nephrologist partners and the ARA Member, materially breaches the JV operating agreement, dissolves, files for bankruptcy or provides written notice of such member’s withdrawal from the JV or upon the occurrence of such other events as provided in the operating agreement. If such redemption is pursuant to the member’s withdrawal or breach of the JV operating agreement, the purchase price of such member’s membership interest is calculated based on the book value; in all other cases, the purchase price is calculated based on the fair market value.
     Under our JV operating agreements, the JV’s net profits, if any, subject to the limitations described below, are typically distributed no less often than quarterly in proportion to holdings of membership interests. These distributions are made out of the JV’s net cash flows as determined in accordance with the JV operating agreement, either by a majority in interest of the JV members or by the managing committee of the JV. As the ARA Member holds the majority of membership interests in nearly all of our JV clinics, we generally have the right to determine distribution amounts and are not required to obtain the consent of our nephrologist partners prior to the making of distributions from our JVs so long as a pro rata distribution is made to our partners and consistent with the terms of the operating agreement. However, we routinely consult and work closely with our physician partners to determine the distribution amount. Because distributions are limited to net cash flow available, the JV clinics are generally unable to distribute amounts that would result in the JV having insufficient capital to pay debt, interest obligations or general operating expenses or have insufficient working capital reserves.
     Our JV operating agreements typically require the members of a JV to make additional capital contributions when the managing committee determines that such financing is needed and the requisite member vote, which may be a majority, supermajority or unanimous vote depending on the agreement, is obtained. As the ARA Member holds the majority of membership interests in nearly all of our JV clinics and is therefore entitled to appoint a majority of the managing committee in most cases, we generally have the power to initiate capital calls and we exercise this power from time to time. Capital contributions are made in proportion to holdings of membership interests.
     Medical Directors
     In order for our clinics to be eligible to participate in the Medicare ESRD program, a qualified physician must act as medical director for each of our clinics. We generally engage practicing or board‑certified nephrologists to serve as medical directors. In locations where an appropriately certified physician is not available to serve as a medical director, we seek waivers from CMS for a physician who has other qualifications to serve as our medical director. As of December 31, 2016, three of our medical directors operated under such waivers. Medical directors also typically own a noncontrolling interest in the clinic as a result of our JV model. Medical directors are responsible for:
Our business and operating model emphasize the following core values. | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | supervising medical aspects of a clinic’s operations; 
 | administering and monitoring patient care policies; 
 | administration of dialysis treatments, including medically necessary items and services;

 
  14

 

 | administration of staff development and training programs; and
 | assessment of all patients. 

      Our medical directors play an important role in quality assurance activities at our clinics and in coordinating the delivery of care. Our medical directors receive compensation for their services subject to independent third‑party valuations. Our medical director arrangements are typically for an initial ten‑year term and provide for automatic renewals at the end of the term, typically for another five‑year term, unless specified events occur or either we or the respective medical director provide prior written notice of intent not to renew for another term. Our medical director arrangements also include geographic restrictions similar to those of other dialysis service providers that restrict our medical directors from competing with us. These non‑compete provisions restrict the physicians from competing with us by owning or providing medical director services to other dialysis clinics, but do not prohibit our medical directors from providing direct patient care services at other locations. Such agreements do not require our medical directors to recommend our dialysis clinics to their patients or directly refer their patients to our dialysis clinics.
     Management Services
     Our executive and senior management team operates out of our Beverly, Massachusetts headquarters. Executive management located at our corporate headquarters includes our chairman and chief executive officer, chief financial officer and general counsel. Other corporate staff includes personnel responsible for the management of operations, clinical and regulatory services, corporate compliance, technical services, project management and billing and collection specialists. Our chief medical officers, divisional vice presidents and regional vice presidents are dispersed geographically throughout the United States.
     Our corporate management is focused on supporting the operation of our dialysis clinics and our nephrologist partners. We enter into agreements to provide management services to our clinics. For compensation for these services, we typically receive a percentage of the clinic’s net revenues. Our management agreements are typically for an initial ten‑year term and provide for automatic renewals at the end of the term, typically for another five‑year term, unless specified events occur or either we or the clinic provide prior written notice of intent not to renew for another term.
     Pursuant to these agreements, we provide our JV clinics with all of the managerial, accounting, financial, technological and administrative support necessary to operate our clinics, which enables our nephrologist partners to focus on delivering high‑quality patient care. We strive to improve the clinical outcomes and operating and financial performance of our dialysis clinics, ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and identify opportunities that are consistent with our growth strategy. The management services we provide to our clinics generally include:
    
Our business and operating model emphasize the following core values. | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------
 | negotiating terms for pharmaceuticals and medical supplies; 
 | human resources functions; 
 | general accounting functions; 
 | clinical and technical services; 
 | supervising site searches and negotiating leases; 
 | obtaining and maintaining licenses, permits and certifications; 
 | providing manuals, policies and procedures; 
 | performing payroll processing, personnel and benefit administration;
 | billing and collection and payment of accounts receivable; 
 | providing staff training programs; 
 | recommending and purchasing of equipment; 
 | preparing and filing cost reports; 

 
  15

 

 | preparing annual operating budgets; 
 | administering financial and clinical information systems;
 | procuring and maintaining insurance policies; and 
 | performing legal and compliance services. 

      Competition
     The dialysis services industry is highly competitive. Because of the lack of barriers to entry into the dialysis services business and the ability of nephrologists to be medical directors for their own clinics, competition for growth in existing and expanding markets is not limited to large competitors with substantial financial resources. According to CMS data, there were more than 6,500 dialysis clinics in the United States as of December 31, 2016. We face competition from large and medium‑sized providers for patients and for the acquisition of existing dialysis clinics. We face particularly intense competition for the identification of nephrologists, whether as attending physicians, medical directors or physician partners. In many instances, our competitors have taken steps to include comprehensive non‑competition provisions within various agreements, thereby limiting the ability of physicians to serve as medical directors or potential joint venture partners for competing dialysis clinics. These non‑competition provisions often contain both time and geographic limitations during the term of the agreement and for a period of years thereafter.
     The dialysis services industry has undergone rapid consolidation. As of the end of 2014, according to the USRDS 2016 Annual Data Report, Fresenius Medical Care and DaVita together accounted for 68.9% of dialysis patients in the United States. The largest not‑for‑profit provider of dialysis services, Dialysis Clinic, Inc., accounted for 3.1% of dialysis patients in the United States. Hospital‑based providers accounted for 4.0% of dialysis patients in the United States, while independent providers and small‑ and medium‑sized dialysis organizations, including our company, collectively accounted for the remainder. Since the time of the data reported in the USRDS 2016 Annual Data Report, consolidation has increased due to recent acquisitions, intensifying competition in the dialysis services industry.
     In addition, over the past few years, several dialysis companies, including some of our largest competitors, have adopted a JV model of dialysis clinic ownership resulting in increased competition in the development, acquisition and operation of JV dialysis clinics. Competition to develop clinics using a JV model could materially adversely affect our growth as well as our operating results and financial condition. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources, more dialysis clinics, a significantly larger patient base and are vertically integrated, and, accordingly, may be able to achieve better economies of scale by asserting leverage against their suppliers, payors, and other commercial parties.
     Reimbursement
     We derive our revenues from providing outpatient and inpatient dialysis treatments. The sources of these revenues are principally government‑based programs, including Medicare, the VA, Medicaid and Medicare‑certified health maintenance organization (HMO) plans and commercial insurance plans. Accordingly, changes to reimbursement under these programs as well as federal budgetary constraints may adversely affect our revenues. As a result of the automatic budget reductions resulting from the Budget Control Act of 2011 (i.e., sequestration), since April 1, 2013, Medicare reimbursement has been subject to a 2% reduction, and this reduction has been extended through 2024. In addition, we are subject to a variety of billing and coding requirements, including the adoption of ICD‑10 on October 1, 2015. The adoption of ICD‑10 could create claims processing issues for our clinics or our payors that could result in additional claims submission or payment delays or denials, and we may incur additional costs for computer system updates, training and other resources required to implement ICD‑10.     Medicare Reimbursement
     Prior to January 1, 2011, Medicare reimbursed outpatient dialysis centers using a composite payment rate methodology. Under that methodology, dialysis centers received a fixed per treatment rate for providing general dialysis services to a Medicare beneficiary and additional payments for ancillary services such as physician‑ordered tests and certain pharmaceuticals, such as EPO. In July 2008, Congress enacted the MIPPA. This legislation introduced a new payment system for dialysis services that began on January 1, 2011 whereby ESRD payments are made under the ESRD PPS, a bundled payment rate which provides a fixed rate for the dialysis treatment itself plus a majority of the 

 
  16

 
renal‑related items and services provided to a patient during the dialysis treatment, including laboratory services, pharmaceuticals, such as Aranesp, and medication administration, which were historically billed separately under the composite rate system. This bundled payment rate is set by CMS each calendar year by (i) updating that base rate from the prior year by a market basket percentage factor (accounting for changes over time in the prices of the mix of goods and services included in dialysis) minus a productivity adjustment; and (ii) multiplying the resulting rate by a wage index budget neutrality adjustment factor.
     To determine the payment rate for an adult, the bundled base rate payable by Medicare is then subject to: (i) facility‑level adjustments; (ii) patient‑level adjustments; (iii) a training add‑on (if applicable); and (iv) an outlier adjustment. The facility level adjustments include modifications for geographic variations in wage rates using an area wage index (which applies to the labor‑related share of the base rate) and an upward adjustment for facilities that furnish a low volume of dialysis treatments (i.e., fewer than 4,000 treatments per year) and apply for the adjustment. The patient level adjustments are patient‑specific “case‑mix” adjustments that accommodate variations in resources required for treatment due to patient age, body surface area, body mass index, time since onset of renal dialysis and the presence of certain co‑morbidities. Facilities that are certified to furnish training services receive a training add‑on payment for peritoneal dialysis and home dialysis training treatments that are adjusted by a geographic area wage index. If a facility treats patients who have high resource requirements in the following categories, an additional upward outlier adjustment is made to the payment rate: (i) ESRD‑related drugs and biologicals that were separately billable prior to January 1, 2011; (ii) ESRD‑related laboratory tests that were separately billable prior to January 1, 2011; (iii) ESRD‑related medical/surgical supplies that were separately billable prior to January 1, 2011; and (iv) ESRD‑related drugs that were covered under Medicare Part D prior to January 1, 2011, excluding oral‑only drugs used in the treatment of ESRD. Finally, under MIPPA, CMS has the discretion to include such other payment adjustments to the applicable base rate as CMS deems appropriate. Since the introduction of the ESRD PPS, such adjustments have varied from year to year.
     A majority of dialysis patients are covered under Medicare. Dialysis patients become eligible for primary Medicare coverage at various times, depending on their age or disability status, as well as whether they are covered by an employer group health plan. Generally, for a patient not covered by an employer group health plan, Medicare becomes the primary payor after a three‑month waiting period, but this three‑month waiting period may be partially or completely waived if the patient participates in a self‑dialysis training program or has a kidney transplant. For a patient covered by an employer group health plan, Medicare generally becomes the primary payor after 33 months, which includes the three‑month waiting period and a 30‑month coordination of benefits period, or earlier if the patient’s employer group health plan coverage terminates or the employer group health plan took into account the patient’s age‑based Medicare entitlement when he or she retired and is paying benefits secondary to Medicare. When Medicare becomes a patient’s primary payor, the payment rate for that patient shifts from the employer group health plan rate to the Medicare payment rate.
     For each covered treatment, Medicare pays 80% of the amount set by the Medicare program. The patient is responsible for the remaining 20%. In most cases, a secondary payor, such as Medicare supplemental insurance, a state Medicaid program or a commercial health plan, covers all or part of these balances. Some patients, who do not qualify for Medicaid but otherwise cannot afford insurance, can apply for premium payment assistance from charitable organizations. If a patient does not have secondary insurance coverage, we endeavor to collect payment from the patient using reasonable collection efforts consistent with federal and state law. However, in these cases we are generally unsuccessful in collecting from the patient the 20% portion of the bundled rate that Medicare does not pay.
     During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, the Medicare ESRD PPS payment rates for our clinics were approximately $247, per treatment.
     CMS issues annual updates to the ESRD PPS which may impact the base rate as well as the various adjusters. The ESRD PPS Final Rule for 2017 was released on October 28, 2016 (the “2017 Final Rule”) and set the rates for calendar year 2017. According to CMS estimates, the 2017 Final Rule will result in an overall increase of payments to U.S. dialysis facilities of 0.7%, with freestanding dialysis facilities receiving an update of 0.7% and hospital-based dialysis facilities receiving an update of 0.9%. The finalized 2017 ESRD base rate of $231.55 is an increase of $1.16 from the calendar year base rate of $230.39. The 2017 Final Rule also increased the home and self-dialysis training add-on payment adjustment to $95.60 from the previous add-on payment adjustment of $50.16. The 2017 Final Rule also outlines the coverage and payment policies for dialysis services furnished to individuals with acute kidney injury (“AKI”), in accordance with sections 1861(s)(2)(F) and 1834(r) of the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015, which requires Medicare to reimburse ESRD facilities for such services. Certain adjustment factors, including facility level and 

 
  17

 
patient level adjustments, the training add-on and the outlier adjustment, could have the effect of increasing or decreasing the actual payment rate for some of our clinics at levels that are different than the overall national average update listed in the 2017 Final Rule’s impact analysis tables. Future adjustments to the ESRD PPS implemented by CMS could have a negative impact upon our Medicare program revenues. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The bundled payment system under the Medicare ESRD program may not reimburse us for all of our operating costs”. 
     Medicaid Reimbursement
     Medicaid programs are state‑administered programs partially funded by the federal government. These programs are intended to provide health coverage for patients whose income and assets fall below state‑defined levels and who are otherwise uninsured. These programs also serve as supplemental reimbursement sources for the co‑insurance payments due from Medicaid‑eligible patients with primary coverage under Medicare. Some Medicaid programs also pay for additional services, including some oral medications that are not covered by Medicare. We are an authorized Medicaid provider in all of the states in which our clinics are located.     Commercial Insurance
     Before Medicare becomes the primary payor, a patient’s employer group health plan or private insurance plan, if any, is generally responsible for payment for a 30‑month coordination period. Although commercial payment rates vary, average commercial payment rates are generally higher than Medicare reimbursement rates. Commercial payment rates are either rates negotiated between us and insurers or third‑party administrator or rates based on our usual and customary fee schedule. We are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors and if our negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of our commercial rate increases, our revenues and operating results could be negatively impacted. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If the rates paid by commercial payors decline, our operating results and cash flows would be adversely affected.” Payment methods include a single lump‑sum per treatment amount, referred to as bundled rates, and separate payments for treatments and pharmaceuticals used as part of the treatment, referred to as fee for service rates. In certain circumstances, we may bill commercial payors as non‑contracted providers.     Government Regulation
     Our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations, all of which are subject to change. These regulations require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, government payment programs, operation of the clinics and equipment, management of clinics, personnel qualifications, maintenance of proper records, quality assurance programs and patient care. Achieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly, and the failure to comply with these laws and other laws can result in civil and criminal penalties such as fines, damages, penalties, overpayment recoupment, loss of enrollment status and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Increased government scrutiny in our industry and potential regulatory changes could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition” and “—If we fail to adhere to all of the complex federal, state and local government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.”     Licensure and Certification
     Our clinics must obtain and maintain certification from CMS to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In some states, we are also required to secure additional state licenses and permits for our clinics. Governmental authorities inspect our clinics to determine if we satisfy applicable federal and state standards and requirements, including the conditions of participation for coverage in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, prior to initial operations and subsequently on a periodic basis. On occasion, these inspections result in deficiency findings, which we address on an expedited basis to ensure compliance with applicable rules and regulations. We do not generally experience significant difficulty in obtaining certifications or licenses or in maintaining our certification or licenses. However, we have experienced some delays in obtaining Medicare certifications from CMS. If CMS delays were to become widespread, it could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Any adverse action relating to our certifications or licenses could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are subject to CMS certification, claims processing 

 
  18

 
requirements, and audits, and any adverse findings in a CMS review could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.”
     Professional Licensing Requirements
     Our clinical personnel must satisfy professional licensing requirements and maintain their professional licenses in the states where they practice their professions. Activities that qualify as professional misconduct under state law may subject them to sanctions, including the loss of their licenses and could subject us to sanctions as well. Some state professional boards impose reciprocal discipline for violations and sanctions arising out of conduct in other states. Healthcare professionals licensed in multiple states could lose all their licenses due to conduct or sanctions in one state. Professional licensing sanctions may also result in overpayments or exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as other third‑party programs. We cannot employ or contract with excluded parties and we therefore monitor the Office of Inspector General’s list of excluded parties on a monthly basis.     Federal Anti‑Kickback Statute
     The federal anti‑kickback statute imposes criminal and civil sanctions on persons who knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, pay or offer remuneration in return for any of the following with respect to items or services that are paid for in whole or in part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs:
 | the referral of a patient to a person for an item or service or for arranging for an item or service;
 | the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for any good, facility, service or item; or 
 | recommending the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for any good, facility, service or item. 

      Court decisions have held that the anti‑kickback statute is violated whenever one of the purposes of remuneration is to induce referrals. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, commonly and jointly referred to as the Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) amended the federal anti‑kickback statute to clarify that, in order to violate the anti‑kickback statute, a defendant need not have known of the existence of the federal anti‑kickback statute or had the specific intent to violate it. The ACA also amended the federal anti‑kickback statute to provide that any claims submitted for items or services that result from an arrangement that violates the federal anti‑kickback statute are false claims under the False Claims Act.
     Violations of the federal anti‑kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment for up to five years, fines of up to $25,000 per violation, or both. Larger fines can be imposed upon corporations under the provisions of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the Alternate Fines Statute. Individuals and entities convicted of violating the federal anti‑kickback statute are also subject to mandatory exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years. Civil penalties for violations of these laws include up to $50,000 in monetary penalties per violation, repayments of up to three times the total payments between the parties and suspension from future participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Some state anti‑kickback statutes also include criminal penalties.
     Regulations issued by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services create exceptions to the federal anti‑kickback statute, known as safe harbors, for certain business transactions and arrangements. Transactions and arrangements that satisfy every element of a safe harbor are deemed not to violate the federal anti‑kickback statute. Transactions and arrangements that do not satisfy all elements of a relevant safe harbor do not necessarily violate the federal anti‑kickback statute but may be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies.
     Our medical directors refer patients to our clinics. Accordingly, our agreements with our medical directors must be in compliance with the federal anti‑kickback statute. The personal services safe harbor to the federal anti‑kickback statute, which permits personal services furnished for fair market value, is the safe harbor most applicable to our medical director agreements. Although we endeavor to structure our medical director agreements to comply with the personal services safe harbor, most of our medical director agreements do not satisfy all elements of the personal services safe harbor. In particular, because of the nature of our medical directors’ duties, we believe it is impossible to satisfy the safe‑harbor requirement that if the services are provided on a part‑time basis, as they are with our medical directors, the agreement must specify the schedule of intervals of service, their precise length and the exact charge for these intervals. 

 
  19

 
Accordingly, our medical director arrangements do not fully qualify for personal services safe harbor protection and may be subject to scrutiny by enforcement agencies.
     We operate all of our clinics in accordance with our JV model under which we have a controlling interest in most of our clinics. Our relationships with our nephrologist partners and other referral sources relating to these JVs are required to comply with the federal anti‑kickback statute. Although we endeavor to structure these relationships to comply with the applicable safe harbors to the federal anti‑kickback statute, these relationships meet many, but not all of the elements of the safe harbors. We believe that our JV investments are offered on a fair market value basis, and our JVs provide returns to our nephrologist partners only in proportion to their actual investment in the joint venture clinic. While we believe that our JVs do not violate the federal anti‑kickback statute, our JVs may be subject to scrutiny by enforcement agencies.
     In addition, a number of our physician partners own shares of ARA as a result of common stock offerings that we have made. Although we endeavor to structure our relationships with these physician partners to comply with the applicable safe harbors to the federal anti‑kickback statute, these relationships meet many, but not all of the elements of the safe harbors. These investments were offered at a price equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the time of each such offering based on independent third‑party valuations, and our common stock provides returns to our physician partners only in proportion to the number of shares they own. While we believe that these offerings do not violate the federal anti‑kickback statute, they may be subject to scrutiny by enforcement agencies. 
     For our de novo clinics, part of the capital required to construct and operate the clinics is achieved through third‑party loans and intercompany loans. In addition, once a clinic is operating, general working capital is provided to the clinic through a third‑party loan or intercompany loan. As intercompany loans do not fall squarely within the scope of a safe harbor to the federal anti‑kickback statute, they may be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our arrangements and relationships with our physician partners and medical directors do not satisfy all of the elements of safe harbors to the federal anti‑kickback statute and certain state anti‑kickback laws and, as a result, may subject us to government scrutiny or civil or criminal monetary penalties or require us to restructure such arrangements.”
     For some of our clinics, we lease clinic space from entities in which physicians or other referral sources hold an ownership interest and we sublease space to referring physicians. We endeavor to structure these relationships to comply with the space rental safe harbor to the federal anti‑kickback statute and set rent on a fair market value basis. We believe that these arrangements satisfy the elements of the space rental safe harbor.
     Because we purchase and sell items and services in the operation of our clinics that may be paid for, in whole or in part, by Medicare or other federal healthcare programs and because we acquire such items and services at a discount, we must structure our purchase arrangements to comply with the federal anti‑kickback statute. We endeavor to structure our relationships with our suppliers to comply with the discount safe harbor to the federal anti‑kickback statute, which permits rebates and reductions in the amount a buyer is charged for an item or service based on an arm’s‑length transaction if, among other requirements, the discount is fully and accurately reported on the invoice or applicable cost report and, if a rebate, the terms are fixed and disclosed in writing to the buyer at the time of the initial purchase. We believe that our vendor contracts that contain discount or rebate provisions substantially comply with the discount safe harbor.
     If any of our relationships with physicians or other referral sources are alleged to violate or found to violate the federal anti‑kickback statute, we may be required to terminate or restructure some or all of our relationships with, purchase some or all of the ownership interests of, or refuse referrals from these referral sources and could be subject to civil and criminal sanctions and penalties, refund requirements and exclusion from government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we fail to adhere to all of the complex federal, state and local government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.”
     Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee‑Splitting
     The laws and regulations relating to our operations vary from state to state, and many states prohibit general business corporations, as we are, from practicing medicine, controlling physicians’ medical decisions or engaging in some practices such as splitting professional fees with physicians. Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions 

 
  20

 
include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable. Neither we nor the JVs directly employ physicians to practice medicine, but rather establish relationships on an independent contractor basis through our medical director agreements. We have endeavored to structure our activities and operations to avoid conflict with state law restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine, and we have endeavored to structure all of our corporate and operational agreements to conform to any licensure requirements, fee‑splitting and related corporate practice of medicine prohibitions. However, other parties may assert that we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or unlawful fee‑splitting despite the way we are structured. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If our arrangements are found to violate state laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine or fee‑splitting, we may not be able to operate in those states.”
     Stark Law
     The Stark Law is a federal civil statute which prohibits a physician who has a financial relationship (i.e., an ownership or compensation arrangement), or who has an immediate family member who has a financial relationship, with entities, including ESRD providers, from referring Medicare patients (and, as interpreted, Medicaid patients) to these entities for the furnishing of designated health services (“DHS”), subject to certain limited exceptions. Designated health services under the Stark Law include durable medical equipment and supplies, home health services, outpatient prescription drugs, inpatient and outpatient hospital services and clinical laboratory services. Relationships that would otherwise implicate the Stark Law may be protected by complying with certain exceptions to the Stark Law, such as the personal services, space rental, equipment rental and fair market value compensation exceptions. All of the requirements of a Stark Law exception must be met in order for referrals for DHS to an entity by a physician with a financial relationship with the entity to be compliant with the law.
     Dialysis services are not included within the definition of DHS because they are reimbursed under the ESRD PPS bundle (a composite rate payment) and are therefore excepted from the definition of DHS. Similarly, all other services that are covered under the ESRD PPS bundle are not DHS. However, clinical laboratory services, outpatient prescription drugs and inpatient hospital services sometimes are rendered in connection with dialysis and are not reimbursed under the ESRD PPS bundle. Accordingly, depending on the relationships between physicians and the providers of these designated health services associated with dialysis, the Stark Law could apply.
     The Stark Law also prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from filing a claim or billing for the services arising out of the prohibited referral. Unlike the federal anti‑kickback statute, the Stark Law is a strict liability statute, meaning that a violation does not require a particular mental state (e.g., knowledge of the prohibited nature of an arrangement or an intention to induce referrals). Accordingly, the prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. Sanctions for violations of the Stark Law include denial of payment for the services provided in violation of the law, refunds of amounts collected in violation of the law, a civil penalty of up to $15,000 for each service arising out of the prohibited referral, exclusion from the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law. Violations of the Stark Law also can form the basis for False Claims Act liability if a person acts with the requisite intent under the False Claims Act. The types of financial arrangements between a physician and an entity that trigger the self‑referral prohibitions of the Stark Law are broad and include direct and indirect ownership and investment interests and compensation arrangements.
     Several of our JVs have agreements with acute care hospitals to provide dialysis services to the hospitals’ inpatients. The Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems rules and Stark Law regulations contain an exception which allows JVs to provide such services under an agreement with the hospitals. Specifically, dialysis services furnished by a hospital that is not certified to provide ESRD services under applicable law are not considered DHS. Accordingly, the Stark Law prohibitions do not apply to these services. However, because these agreements establish a financial relationship between our clinics and these hospitals (and indirectly between our physician partners and these hospitals), any referrals from our physician partners to these hospitals for DHS implicate the Stark Law. Accordingly, we endeavor to structure these agreements to comply with the rental of office space, rental of equipment, personal service arrangements and/or fair market value compensation exceptions to the Stark Law.
     We believe that various exceptions under the Stark Law and the definition of DHS apply to our provision of dialysis services in our clinics and under our agreements with hospitals. However, CMS could determine that the Stark Law requires us to restructure existing compensation agreements with our medical directors and to repurchase or to 

 
  21

 
request the sale of ownership interests in our JVs held by referring physicians or, alternatively, to refuse to accept referrals for DHS from these physicians. If CMS were to interpret the Stark Law to apply to aspects of our operations and we were not able to achieve compliance, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
     If any of our business transactions or arrangements including those described above were found to violate the federal anti‑kickback statute or the Stark Law, we could face criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, including possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other state and federal healthcare programs. Any findings that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse impact on our earnings. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we fail to adhere to all of the complex federal, state and local government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.”
     Fraud and Abuse Under State Law
     Many states in which we operate dialysis clinics have statutes prohibiting physicians from holding financial interests in various types of medical clinics to which they refer patients. Some states also have laws similar to the federal anti‑kickback statute that may affect our ability to receive referrals from physicians with whom we have financial relationships, such as our medical directors or physician partners. Some of these statutes include exemptions applicable to our medical directors and other physician relationships. Some, however, include no explicit exemption for medical director services or other services for which we contract with and compensate referring physicians or for joint ownership interests of the type held by some of our referring physicians. If these laws change or are interpreted to apply to referring physicians with whom we contract or to our physician partners, we may be required to terminate or restructure some or all of our relationships with, purchase some or all of the ownership interests of, or refuse referrals from these referring physicians and could be subject to civil and administrative sanctions, refund requirements and exclusion from government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our business.     Federal Laws Related to Fraud and False Statements Relating to Healthcare
     Federal laws, including HIPAA and the False Claims Act, make it unlawful to make false statements or commit fraud in connection with a health benefit program, including Medicare, Medicaid, and private third‑party payors. These federal laws include prohibitions on (i) making false statements in connection with compliance with Medicare conditions for coverage, (ii) making false statements or submitting false documents or otherwise concealing or covering up a material fact in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services, (iii) making or attempting to make a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, (iv) knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, and (v) willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense. Any violation of these laws may lead to significant penalties and may have a material adverse effect upon our business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we fail to adhere to all of the complex federal, state and local government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.”     The False Claims Act
     The federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) prohibits presenting false claims, false statements and false requests for payment to the federal government. In part, the FCA authorizes the imposition of treble damages and civil penalties on any person who:
 | knowingly presents or causes to be presented to the federal government, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval; 
 | knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement that is material to getting a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the federal government; 
 | has possession, custody or control of property or money used, or to be used, by the government and knowingly delivers, or causes to be delivered, less than all of that money or property;



-

 
  22

 

 | knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the Government, or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government; or
 | conspires to do any of the foregoing. 

      Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Under the FCA, it is unlawful for healthcare providers to knowingly file a false claim for reimbursement with the federal government or with a government contractor. As a result of the ACA, any claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti‑kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. The ACA also created a new obligation for healthcare providers to repay to the federal government any overpayments that they receive from the federal government within 60 days of identification. A provider may incur substantial penalties for knowingly failing to repay an overpayment to the federal government, and, under the ACA, if such overpayments are not disclosed and returned to the federal government within 60 days of identification, the overpayment becomes an obligation under the FCA. The FCA requires that providers allocate resources to identify overpayments and to train employees on the potential repercussions of filing false claims with the federal government or government contractors and to monitor employee actions to detect potential false claims.
     The penalties for a violation of the FCA range from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim plus three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim. The federal government has used the False Claims Act to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare and other federal healthcare programs, including coding errors, billing for services not rendered, the submission of false cost reports, billing for services at a higher payment rate than appropriate, billing under a comprehensive code as well as under one or more component codes included in the comprehensive code and billing for care that is not considered medically necessary. Such prosecutions have resulted in substantial (multi‑million and multi‑billion dollar) settlements in addition to criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition to the provisions of the FCA, which provide for civil enforcement, the federal government can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government.
     We use an independent third‑party accounting firm to perform annual billing, coding and payment audits, and when overpayments are identified, we endeavor to promptly return them to the applicable payor.
     State False Claims Laws
     Many states have adopted their own false claims laws, which generally mirror the federal False Claims Act and are designed to prevent false claims from being submitted to state healthcare programs and commercial insurers. Violations of these laws may result in monetary penalties or other sanctions for the violator. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations. However, violation of these laws and the imposition of related consequences could have a materially adverse impact on our operations.     The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
     The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), and the privacy and security regulations implementing the statute (collectively referred to as “HIPAA”), requires us to provide certain protections to patients and their protected health information (“PHI”). HIPAA requires us to afford patients certain rights regarding their PHI, and to limit uses and disclosure of their PHI existing in any form of media (electronic and hardcopy). HIPAA also implemented the use of standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities like us must use when engaging in certain electronic healthcare transactions, including activities associated with billing and the collection of payment for healthcare services. HIPAA also requires that we enter into agreements with those entities that perform services on our behalf (“business associates”) and who may have access to PHI.  We have a well‑established HIPAA compliance program, including a privacy officer, a security officer, policies and procedures, HIPAA compliance Business Advocate Agreements with vendors and workforce training. In accordance with the requirements of HIPAA, we have implemented administrative, physical and technical safeguards, including safeguards applicable to electronic PHI. We perform periodic risk assessments with the assistance of a third party and in accordance with the requirements of HIPAA. We believe our HIPAA compliance program sufficiently addresses HIPAA requirements.
    
 
  23

 

 HIPAA requires the notification of patients, and other compliance actions, in the event of a breach with respect to the security of PHI. Certain guidance provided by HHS sets forth elective standards that provide for a “safe harbor” for rendering PHI secure such that an inappropriate use or disclosure involving such PHI would not be subject to the breach notification requirements. If notification to patients of a breach is required, such notification must be provided without unreasonable delay and in no event later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach. In addition, if PHI of 500 or more individuals is improperly used or disclosed, we would be required to report the improper use or disclosure to the Department of Health and Human Services, which would post the violation on its website. If there was improper use or disclosure of PHI of more than 500 individuals in the same jurisdiction, we would be required to report the improper use or disclosure to the media. Penalties for impermissible use or disclosure of PHI were increased by the HITECH Act, resulting in tiered penalties starting at $100 per violation, and increasing to $50,000 per violation and up to $1.5 million per year for the same type of violation.
     In addition, HIPAA authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents. Courts are able to award damages, costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to file suit against us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care cases in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI. In addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and business associates for compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security standards. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the civil monetary penalty paid by the violator. 
     Although we conduct HIPAA training for our employees and contractors, the improper use or disclosure of PHI by any of our clinics, employees or contractors could result in significant fines and reputational damage to us. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we fail to comply with current or future laws or regulations governing the collection, processing, storage, access, use, security and privacy of personally identifiable, protected health or other sensitive or confidential information, our business, reputation and profitability could suffer.”
     State Privacy and Medical Record Retention Laws
     Many states in which we operate have state laws that protect the privacy and security of personally identifiable information, including PHI. State patient privacy and confidentiality laws generally require providers to keep confidential certain patient information, including information contained in medical records. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with the stricter provisions. Violations of these laws could lead to monetary penalties against providers and sanctions against licensed individuals. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but some may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. California’s patient privacy laws, for example, provide for penalties of up to $250,000 and permit injured parties to sue for damages. The interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our clinics and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability.
     Similarly, medical record retention laws place a duty on providers to retain medical records for certain periods of time and dispose of records in a certain manner. Violations of these duties may result in sanctions from state agencies or from the Medicare program. We believe that we are in material compliance with the above laws and regulations. However, violation of any such laws and the imposition of related consequences could have a materially adverse impact on our operations.
     Other Regulations
     Our operations are subject to various state hazardous waste and non‑hazardous medical waste disposal laws and regulations. These laws and regulations do not classify as hazardous most of the waste produced from dialysis services, although we can be subject to liability under both federal and state laws, as well as under contracts with those who haul our wastes, with respect to our waste disposal. Occupational Safety and Health Administration laws and regulations also apply to us, including, for example, those that require employers to provide workers who are occupationally exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials with prescribed protections. These requirements apply to all healthcare clinics, including dialysis clinics, and also require employers to determine which employees may be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials and to have in effect a written exposure control plan. In addition, employers are required to provide or employ hepatitis B vaccinations, personal protective equipment and other safety devices, infection 

 
  24

 
control training, post‑exposure evaluation and follow‑up, waste disposal techniques and procedures and work practice controls, as well as comply with various record‑keeping requirements.
     We lease many properties and own some properties in the United States. If contamination is discovered in our buildings or in the surface or subsurface or in the groundwater beneath any of our facilities, whether leased or owned, we may be liable for the investigation or cleanup of the contamination and for damages arising out it, pursuant to applicable state and/or federal law and/or under the terms of our leases. Such liability may arise even when we do not cause or contribute to the contamination (for example, where it is caused by a prior occupant or a neighbor). We take precautions to avoid contamination in or affecting our facilities. We cannot assure you, though, that such conditions will not affect us in the future.
     Corporate Compliance Programs
     We have adopted and maintain an active corporate compliance program, including a corporate compliance officer, compliance hotline, the policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable healthcare laws and proper billing of claims, and employee training regarding such policies and procedures.
     In addition, we have adopted and maintain a HIPAA compliance program, including privacy and security officers, policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with HIPAA and associated state laws relating to privacy and security and employee training regarding such policies and procedures.
     Insurance
     We maintain professional liability and general liability insurance in amounts that we believe are appropriate, based on our actual claims experience and expectations for future claims. Future claims could, however, exceed our applicable insurance coverage. Physicians practicing at our dialysis centers are required to maintain their own malpractice insurance, and our medical directors are required to maintain coverage for their individual private medical practices. Our liability policies cover our medical directors for the performance of their duties as medical directors at our outpatient dialysis centers. Coverage under certain of these policies is contingent upon the policy being in effect when a claim is made regardless of when the events that caused the claim occurred. The cost and availability of such coverage may change in the future. We also currently maintain property damage insurance and other types of insurance coverage we believe to be consistent with industry practice. In most states, we maintain private market coverage for our workers’ compensation risk. The policy limits equal the minimum statutory requirements. In certain states, we procure comparable coverage through various state funds.     Information Systems
     We have invested and will continue to invest in areas such as information systems and data analytics in an effort to become more efficient and meet the demands for improved clinical outcomes. We are currently evaluating EMR systems for implementation at our facilities. We address our information and data security needs by relying on applicable members of our staff and third parties, including auditors and third‑party service providers. We have implemented administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the security of personally identifiable, protected health and other sensitive or confidential information that we collect, process, store, access or use, and we take commercially reasonable actions to ensure that our third‑party service providers are taking appropriate security measures to protect the data and information they access, use or collect on our behalf. However, there is no guarantee that these measures can provide absolute security with respect to such data and information.     Trademarks
     We own certain trademarks and logos, including AmericanRenal, AmericanRenal Associates, The Nephrologist is the Center of Our Universe and the American Renal Associates logo. Each one of these trademarks or logos is registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We consider these trademarks and the associated name recognition to be important to our business.

 Employees
     As of December 31, 2016, we had 4,601 employees, consisting of 1,541 nurses, 1,938 patient care and equipment technicians and 1,122 other employees. Our 379 nephrologist partners are not our employees, nor are our medical directors, who are paid pursuant to their contractual arrangements. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Although we do not currently directly employ personnel that are members of a union, we lease employees in New York and the District of Columbia that are members of unions. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
