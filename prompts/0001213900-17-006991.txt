ITEM 1 Business
 
We were formerly a special purpose company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands on September 23, 2014 under the name E-Compass Acquisition Corp. (“E-Compass”) in order to serve as a vehicle for the acquisition of an operating business in the e-commerce and consumer retail industry. On February 10, 2017, pursuant to the terms of a merger agreement, dated as of July 25, 2016 (the “Merger Agreement”), through a series of transactions, we merged with our wholly owned subsidiary to reincorporate into Delaware and then acquired NYM Holding, Inc.(“NYM”), and as a result, NYM became our direct wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Transactions”). As a result of the Transactions, as of immediately after the Transactions, the former stockholders of NYM own approximately 83.9% of our outstanding common stock and the former stockholders of E-Compass own the remaining 16.1%.
 
The Merger Agreement is described more fully in the sections entitled “The Business Combination Proposal” and “The Acquisition Agreement” beginning at pages 38 and 60, respectively, of the final prospectus contained in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 and definitive proxy statement (the “Proxy Statement/Prospectus”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on December 16, 2016 by iFresh and E-Compass, and such description is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Upon the closing of the Transactions, E-Compass’s common stock, rights and units ceased trading and our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “IFMK”.
 
Overview and History

iFresh, through its wholly owned subsidiary, NYM, is a fast growing Asian/Chinese grocery supermarket chain in the North Eastern U.S. providing food and other merchandise hard to find in mainstream grocery stores. Since NYM was formed in 1995, it has targeted the Chinese and other Asian populations (collectively, the “Asian Americans”) in the U.S. with a deep cultural understanding of its consumers’ unique consumption habits. iFresh currently has eight retail supermarkets across New York, Massachusetts and Florida, with over 6,862,000 sales transactions in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. In addition to retail supermarkets, iFresh operates two in-house wholesale businesses, Strong America Inc. (“Strong America”) and New York Mart Group (“NYMG”), that offer more than 6,000 wholesale products and service to iFresh retail supermarkets and over 1,000 external customers including wholesale stores, retail supermarkets and restaurants. iFresh has a stable supply of food from farms in New Jersey and Florida, ensuring reliable supplies of popular vegetables, fruits and seafood. iFresh’s wholesale businesses and long term relationships with various farms insulate iFresh from supply interruptions, allowing it remain competitive even during difficult markets.

Based on management’s cultural understanding of the Asian American market, iFresh aims to satisfy the increasing demands of Asian Americans, whose purchasing power has been growing rapidly, for fresh and unique produce, seafood and other groceries that are not found in mainstream supermarkets, such as produce like Shanghai baby bok choy, snap bean, winter gourd, baby Chinese kale, longyan and lychee; a variety of live seafood such as shrimp, clams, lobster, geoduck, and Alaska king crab; and Chinese special groceries like soy sauce, sesame oil, oyster sauce, bean paste, Sriracha, tofu, noodles and dried mushroom. With an in-house logistics team and strong relationships with farms, iFresh is capable of offering high quality specialty perishables at competitive prices. Specialty produce, live seafood and other perishables constituted 60.2% of iFresh’s total sales during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.
 
iFresh’s business began as Strong America, a wholesale business founded in 1995 in Long Island City, New York. Strong America imported food and groceries from China and other East Asian countries and sold them to various types of retailers in the New York area. Witnessing the rapid growth of Chinese immigrants and the potential of this niche market, iFresh opened its first retail supermarket in Chinatown in downtown Manhattan in August 2001. From 2001 to 2014, iFresh expanded steadily, hired a bilingual team that grew into midlevel managers, and reshaped itself into a retail supermarket chain featuring exotic Asian food and other items. Since 2001, iFresh opened five stores in Brooklyn, Flushing, Elmhurst and Manhattan’s Chinatown, where the Asian and Chinese population is highly concentrated. In 2009, iFresh acquired Ming’s supermarket in Boston, Massachusetts. Observing that the Chinese and Asian population was growing quickly in Florida, iFresh opened its first store in Sunrise, Florida in 2012. In 2013, it acquired Zen Supermarket in Quincy, Massachusetts to better cater to the growing demand in the Greater Boston Area.

iFresh’s net sales were $130.9 million and $131.2 million for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. iFresh’s net income was $1.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 57.4%, from $3.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $6.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $2.2 million, or 25.7%, from $8.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2016.

Industry and Market Analysis
 
Grocery Shopping Habits of Target Market
 
Buy Fresh — Asian Americans, of which Chinese Americans constitute a significant percentage, typically purchase fresh, perishable food, according to Nielsen’s Asian-American Consumer 2015 Report1. Unique cooking styles of Asian Americans, such as steaming, wokking and shared hot-pot cooking, require fresh ingredients not commonly found in the U.S. Asian Americans purchase Perishables that are all over-index compared with that of general U.S. population. For example, Asian Americans purchase fresh seafood 50% more frequently than the general market and spend 147% more on the category than non-Asian Americans in the total U.S. population. Asian Americans purchase fresh vegetables 26% more frequently than non-Asian American consumers and spend 62% more than the total U.S. population. Additionally, Asian Americans purchase fresh fruit 11% more frequently than non-Asian Americans and spend 27% more than the total U.S. population. Consistent with the foregoing, iFresh’s fresh seafood, fresh vegetables and fresh fruit in the aggregate contributed 38% to iFresh’s total sale as of March 31, 2017.

Unique Species and Cuisines — Asian cuisines incorporate many Perishables that are hard to find in traditional U.S. supermarkets. Many cuisines require vegetables not commonly planted in the U.S. or meat not widely used by mass market consumers. The following two examples illustrate the uniqueness in food species and in Asian cuisines:
 
Example 1: Unique vegetables species
 
Vegetables make up the bulk of daily consumption by Asian Americans. Asian American consumers usually buy a variety of vegetables in large quantities. More importantly, Asian American consumers use unique vegetable species such as bitter melons, Chinese yams, vine spinaches, Chinese cabbages and winter melon. Asian Americans therefore value supermarkets that provide fresh vegetable offerings at affordable prices.
 


Example 2: Unique fish species and cooking styles
 
Asian American consumers consume fish not commonly sold in mainstream supermarkets. Unlike many mainstream supermarkets, iFresh offers consumers live fish in fish tanks and has fish experts readily available to provide fish cleaning services free of charge.
 
In addition, Asian American consumers use many more parts of the fish than do non-Asian American consumers. For example, fish head soup and fish tail soup are two popular dishes that require only the fish head or fish tail as ingredients. Asian Americans also buy live fish and ask fish experts to cut them in thin slices as an ingredient of boiled fish in hot sauce or fish hot pot. iFresh organizes the seafood section according to the needs of its customers, which iFresh believes not only attracts customers, but effectively boosts sales of seafood.

In addition to vegetables and fish, Asian Americans look for the following additional specialty products:
 
Fruits — Mainstream supermarkets rarely have pitaya, longyan, lychee and star fruit available. Such unavailability motivates Asian Americans to shop at Chinese and Asian grocery stores on a regular basis to purchase such specialty fruits.
 
Meat — Mainstream supermarkets generally offer meats in cuts such as cubes, steaks, slices and ribs. However, such supermarkets rarely offer super-thinly sliced hot-pot meat, organ meat or chicken feet. Chinese and Asian cuisines use various kinds of meat for different purposes. Asian specialty supermarkets such as iFresh understand such Asian cuisines and dietary needs, and fill the market gap in offering hot-pot meat, organ meat, chicken feet and other rare cuts of meat on a regular basis.
 
Snacks, Seasonings and Other — Asian specialty supermarkets offer various snacks, seasonings, cooking utensils and other items not generally found in mainstream U.S. supermarkets. Chinese and Asian seasonings and spices include peanut oil, cooking wine, vinegars, dark soy source, black bean sauce, pepper oil and chilly oil. More specifically, some seasoning or spice can include sub-types, each of which has its own target customers. For example, people from the north and south part of China usually shop for different type of vinegars.
 
Consequently, we believe that the uniqueness in the shopping habits of iFresh’s target customers evidences the importance of Asian American specialty supermarkets such as iFresh. iFresh’s understanding of Asian American culture and eating habits fill a market gap and distinguishes Asian supermarkets from mainstream competitors.

Growth Potential and Features of Asian/Chinese Americans
 
Fast growing population — According to the Nielsen Asian American 2015 Report, the Asian-American population grew 46% from 2002 to 20.3 million people as of 2014. Beginning in 2013, China replaced Mexico as the number one country for recent immigration.3 According to the U.S. census bureau, as of 2014, the Chinese population was the largest Asian group in the United States with a population of 4.52 million people, almost 1 million over the Asian-Indian population and accounts for 21.4% of the total Asian-American population4. We believe Chinese Americans will be an increasingly significant part of the multicultural majority U.S. population.
 
Fast growing purchasing power — The Nielsen report points that Asian-American population is not only the fastest growing population demographic in the U.S., but the Asian American demographic is the demographic with the largest percentage increase in buying power. The buying power of Asian-Americans was $770 billion in 2014 and is estimated to increase to $1 trillion by 2018.5 In terms of household income for Chinese Americans, they recorded a median household income of $67,396,6 which was 31% higher than the U.S. national average of $53,2507, possibly due to their high education level and cultural emphasis on education. With respect to shopping habits, Asian-Americans are 31% more likely than non-Asian Americans to spend more than $200 a week at the grocery store8, and spend 19% more on food than general market consumers.9
 
Online prone — According to the Nielsen report, the Asian-American population is young, tech savvy and frequently shops online. Asian Americans visit digital stores 37% more frequently and spend 22% more monthly than their non-Hispanic white peers.10 We believe that Asian Americans’ avid use and adoption of technology illustrates the importance of an online platform, social Media and mobile apps when promoting brand to this specific customer group.
 
Concentrated but on the move — Asian and Chinese Americans are most highly concentrated in west and east coast metropolitan areas, but as the need for a highly educated high-technology workforce increases, suburbs with better work and living environments and schools are attracting a large numbers of skilled Asian-Americans which encourages “ethnoburbs” of various scales nationwide dominated by non-white ethnic groups.
 
Current Industry Landscape
 
Highly Fragmented and unsophisticated competitors — We consider the markets we participate in to be highly fragmented. There is no recognized industry leader nationwide. Most market participants are small players with a single store run by family members catering to the local market11, meaning that the bulk of competitors are unsophisticated. Because of this, iFresh believes that most of its competitors are unable to take advantage of economies of scale, modern management, in-house wholesales facilities and logistics which distinguishes iFresh from its competitive peers. Currently a leader on the east coast, iFresh is setting its short term goal to achieve the scale of HMart, the Korean specialty grocery chain operating 51 stores with over $1.5 billion annual revenue as of 2015. The reality of low market concentration and unsophisticated competitors gives iFresh the opportunity to consolidate the market and cement its dominant market position.

Unsatisfied Customers — As previously mentioned, there are an increasing number of younger Chinese that choose to reside out of traditional Chinese communities for better working, educational and environmental opportunities. However, large-scale comprehensive Chinese groceries tend to exist only in Chinatowns. The weekly shopping for this group of Asian Americans involves either long distance travel or a compromise at local small grocery stores with limited selections and high prices. iFresh will try to meet their demand as well as reshape the market by increasing the number of stores and via its online-shopping initiatives.
 
Limited Vendors — Many of the products that stock iFresh’s shelves can rarely be sourced from the typical U.S. vendors. Most vendors of U.S. Chinese and Asian supermarkets are individually owned and small in size. Securing a sufficient and stable supply of core perishables, therefore, is a recognized challenge in this niche market. Observing the challenge and through years of effort, iFresh has established long-standing relationships with several large farms. We believe that the relationships with these farms is symbiotic — on one hand, cooperative farms provide iFresh with priority when supplying core produce popular with Asian American customers; on the other hand, iFresh communicates the latest market trends and customer preference to cooperating farms, ensuring the farms’ produce selection and activities closely target the market demand.
 
Fast Growing Market — The growing population and increasing purchasing power cultivate a promising market prospect in good momentum. According to The US Census Bureau — American Community Survey 2011 – 2015, Chinese population had a growth rate of 17.43% from 2011 to 2015, far beyond the 3.07% growth rate of US population and even the 8.77% Hispanic population growth rate. New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida and Maryland alone have a total Chinese population of 1,139136, making up more than 27.56% of total Chinese American population nationwide.
 
In sum, we see a great opportunity for market consolidation and significant potential for improvement in this market. We believe iFresh has all the right ingredients to address the current market imperfections and we are ready to catch the wave to make iFresh a national leader in the niche market.
 
iFresh’s Business Model
 
iFresh’s business model features a vertically integrated structure covering upstream supply and downstream retail supermarkets. iFresh has its own wholesale businesses, Strong America and New York Mart Group (“NYMG”), which supply 31% of the items sold in its retail supermarkets with seven self-owned brands, including Family Elephant, Feiyan and Green Acre, and an exclusive distributorship for nine famous foreign brands such as Shuang Deng, A-Sha, Bai Lu and Gu Yue Long Shan. For many years, iFresh has worked with farms that mainly grow Chinese specialty vegetables and fruits and supply the most popular yet hard-to-source vegetables and fruits directly to iFresh supermarkets and maintains long-term and stable relationships with them. iFresh centralizes purchases through one of its wholesale facilities by making quarterly purchase plans and placing weekly order with farms. The long-term relationships with farms and the central purchase management system secure its supply of the most popular vegetables and fruits, even though iFresh doesn’t have any long-term contractual relationships with its farm suppliers. Working with its vendors, iFresh can respond to market trends to avoid supply interruption in high seasons. iFresh has a diversified vendor base and has established sustainable relationships during its 20-year history in this niche market sector.
 
iFresh’s two wholesale businesses, Strong America and NYMG, collectively provide more than 6,000 wholesale products and services to iFresh’s retail supermarkets and over 1,000 external customers throughout the United States. Such external customers include, but are not limited to, wholesale stores, retail supermarkets and restaurants. The two wholesale arms have distinct focuses: Strong America mainly provides grocery products and services to iFresh retail store and external supermarkets, while NYMG focuses on supplying fresh perishable items to retail supermarkets. Strong America owns the nine exclusive distributorship rights and iFresh’s ten self-owned brands. Strong America acquired its self-owned brands from third parties and integrated them into its wholesale catalog. The ten self-owned brands cover rice, noodles, seasonings (including Chinese spices), frozen vegetables, frozen seafood, and frozen dumplings, which are all popular daily staples for Chinese and other Asian consumers in the United States. Strong America imports over 2,000 items from all over Asia, with products from mainland China, Thailand and Taiwan making up 95% of its total imports. NYMG serves as an important connection to farms in New Jersey and Florida, which ensures reliable supplies of popular vegetables, fruits and seafood to iFresh’s retail stores. The two in-house wholesale arms of iFresh not only secure the supply of products for iFresh’s retail business, but also offer significant synergies in iFresh’s operations.

Produce and groceries are delivered to iFresh supermarkets in New York, Massachusetts and Florida on a daily basis from iFresh’s wholesale facilities, farm partners and external vendors as directed by iFresh’s in-house logistics system. iFresh has an 80,000 square foot warehouse in Long Island City, New York, which serves as its regional distribution center for imported and frozen products. For live seafood or produce, the in-house logistics team uses hibernation technology and the cold-chain network to best ensure freshness from farm to shelf.
 
With 8 retail supermarkets in New York, Massachusetts and Florida, mainly in Chinatowns or city centers, and average store sizes over 10,000 square feet, iFresh has over 6.8 million annual sales transactions. At the same time, iFresh continues to reach out to the growing Asian American population living in suburban areas through its online shopping and delivery initiative. iFresh also has successfully exported live lobsters to China, which bears the potential to ignite the demand of a large market.
 
The graph below depicts iFresh’s business model and its vertically integrated structure:
 
Figure 2 Business Model of iFresh
 


iFresh’s Competitive Strengths
 
Well Recognized Brand in Niche Market
 
iFresh capitalizes on its established brand and reputation in the following respects:
 
i. Benefit from cost efficiency and economies of scale:
 
Unlike many of its direct competitors which are family-owned single stores, iFresh has 8 retail supermarkets. With larger supplies and strong sales, iFresh is often approached by third party vendors and capable of getting competitive prices for a wide range of items. This corporate structure coupled with its wholesale facilities further enables iFresh to best deploy its experienced staff to coordinate stock and to make most use of its infrastructure and distribution network.

-

 

ii. Strong negotiation power with vendors and competitors
 
iFresh is often approached by third party vendors and capable of getting competitive price due to its chain store structure and sustainably strong sale performance. iFresh’s two in-house wholesale facilities are influential in Chinese and Asian goods importing and wholesale industries. At least five of iFresh’s largest direct competitors are also its clients for imported goods, frozen seafood and other frozen products. Additionally, iFresh’s long-standing relationship with farms in New Jersey and Florida reduce its reliance on external vendors. We believe the iFresh brand, scale, in-house wholesale facilities and long-standing relationship with farm partners shaped its negotiation power with vendors and competitors.
 
iii. Developed Infrastructure
 
Unlike many of its competitors, iFresh has its own wholesale channel, Strong America, which has been in the business of importing and exporting Chinese and Asian specialty food and groceries for over 20 years. Apart from channel advantages, Strong America specializes in identifying products that are popular among Asian American consumers but rarely found in mainstream stores. Without multi-layer intermediates, iFresh retail supermarkets set such products at competitive prices, not only securing the supply of popular products, but boosting its operation profitability as well. Furthermore, for most commonly needed ingredients like rice, noodles, frozen Chinese and Asian convenience foods, imported snacks and Chinese and Asian seasonings and spices, Strong America established 7 self-owned brands and obtained the exclusive distributorship for 9 famous Chinese brands, as listed in Table 3 and Table 2, respectively. In addition, iFresh has built and maintained relationships with retailers of various sizes. In other words, iFresh’s advantages in market familiarity, established infrastructure, scale, sourcing management capability and well-recognized brand reputation shape a high barrier protecting it from immediate impact of new entrants.
Track Record in Operation and Expansion
 
i. Record of acquisitions in different locations
 
Since 2009, iFresh successfully acquired three stores, one in New York and two in Massachusetts. iFresh targeted stores in desirable locations, especially under-performers that iFresh could acquire at an advantageous cost. iFresh then utilized its well-developed in-house distribution networks, corporate infrastructure and long-term relationship with farm partners and third party vendors to boost performance. All three acquired stores realized enhanced and stabilized profit the first year after acquisition.
 
ii. Adoption of scalable small-box format
 
iFresh brands itself as a player in the specialty store sector and adopts the small-box format generally adopted in this sector. We believe the small-box format fits into iFresh’s business model and enables it to boost profitability from structural synergy and efficiency.
 
Compared with iFresh’s mainstream competitors whose average store size normally ranges from 40,000 — 60,000 square feet, the average store size of iFresh is approximately 19,000 square feet with average selling space of approximately 14,000 square feet. iFresh’s adoption of small-box model is rooted on its understanding that customers shop with iFresh mainly for unique produce, seafood and groceries that are difficult to find elsewhere. The small-box format forces iFresh to focus on products that cover the target customer’s unique needs. In addition, the small-box format ensures flexibility, makes it easier for iFresh to discontinue individual products and react quickly to market changes.

Strong Vendor Management
 
i. Capability to source globally
 
iFresh has global sourcing capability mainly through Strong America and NYMG. In the aggregate, Strong America and NYMG import over 2,000 items from all over Asia. The top three importing countries are China, Thailand and Taiwan, making up 95% of total imports. iFresh’s wholesale businesses together supply 23% of total goods, in which 6% are imported goods, sold in iFresh retail supermarkets at attractive prices.
 
Strong America is also the exclusive distributor of nine famous overseas brands, covering cooking wine, yellow wine, rice noodles, seasonings and spices and snacks. They are all famous daily food staple brands in China and are familiar to iFresh’s target customers. We believe that the exclusive distributorship strengthens iFresh brand and its negotiation power among current competitors, new market entrants and consumers. The table below lists the details of iFresh’s exclusive distributorship:

Online Grocery Pioneer
 
To satisfy the needs of the growing suburban Chinese population, iFresh started its online shopping and delivery service in January 2016 and has achieved good growth momentum since then. In May 2016, iFresh launched its mobile App, NYMart, to further enhance the shopping experience for its customers. The online shopping and delivery service currently covers New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The orders placed and sales have witnessed 7.9 times and 11.9 times growth, respectively, during its fifteen months of operation. With capital support and experienced personnel in place, iFresh believes that online shopping and delivery will be a crucial part in iFresh’s future growth strategy. iFresh’s online grocery initiative witnesses an accumulated transaction volume of 7,964 and accumulated sales of approximately $675,460 from its commencement of operation to March 31, 2017.
Proprietary and in-house Cold Chain System
 
Since Mr. Long Deng established Strong America in 1995, iFresh has strived to build a proprietary cold-chain logistics system which evolved with the expansion of iFresh. Based on years of experience, iFresh’s logistics team is now capable of delivering frozen goods to more than 20 states in the Eastern U.S. using its unique packing and temperature control technology.
 
Live Seafood — All live seafood is collected daily from wharfs or markets at midnight, and immediately distributed via in-house logistics to all retail supermarkets. For different species, iFresh maintains different water temperatures and oxygen density in its tanks and containers. Hibernation technology is widely used in the in-house cold-chain system for long distance distribution to best ensure freshness and quality. The hibernation technology even enables iFresh to deliver live lobsters to China with an over 95% survival rate.

Fruit & Vegetables — iFresh adopts different storage technologies based on characteristics of different fruits and vegetables, the knowledge only obtained from years of experience. All vegetables and fruits are delivered and sold on a daily basis, to lower worn rate, lower human cost and keep up the high quality.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Historical Growth strategy
 
iFresh grew via two major paths in the past 20-year operation: organic growth and acquisition. The vertically integrated network, steadily growing new stores and online shopping initiative constituted the 3 pillars for organic growth. As of acquisitions, iFresh was highly selective in its past acquisitions and had ensured its expansion path was coordinated with its infrastructure construction.
 
Acquisition Record — iFresh has strategically targeted only those locations compatible with its infrastructure.
 
iFresh was able to build its brand within the local Asian and Chinese community and quickly turned distressed stores into profitable assets despite different geographic locations and market conditions. Based on its understanding of the market, iFresh quickly identified the weakness of acquired stores and took specific actions. For example, prior to acquisition, Ming’s Supermarkets sold mainly imports from China, had high sourcing and operation costs and offered limited live seafood and produce. After taking it over, iFresh immediately increased its produce and live seafood offerings thanks to its in-house logistics system and partnership with farms. iFresh’s wholesale subsidiaries also enable iFresh to offer diversified selections, attracting customers not only from China, but from Korea, Japan, Thailand and other East and Southeast Asian countries. For the Brooklyn store, iFresh identified that high worn-out rate and lack of standardized operation hindered store profitability. After taking it over, iFresh started a 3-month personnel training course for live product management and equipment procedures, which led a significant reduction in wear-and-tear rate from 6% to 1% and an equivalent 5% increase in profitability. A performance related pay system and internal promotion was also introduced to and encouraged in the Brooklyn store to best stimulate staff performance in the store.
 
iFresh has a record of successful acquisitions. For example:
 

● | In 2009, iFresh acquired Ming’s Supermarket in Boston, Massachusetts and turned Ming’s Supermarket into a subsidiary retailer under iFresh management. The initial acquisition investment and renovation cost was about $2.7 million. NYM increased sales from $8.2 million to $17.0 million, or 107.3%, one year after the acquisition. For the year ended March 31, 2017, Ming’s Supermarket recorded net sales of $17.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 million. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In 2011, iFresh acquired a store in Brooklyn, New York and operates it as New York Mart 8th Ave, Inc (8th Ave). The initial investment was about $1.3 million. After one year under iFresh operation, the store’s annual sales increased from $11.0 million to 18.0 million, or 63.6%. For the year ended March 31, 2017, New York Mart 8th Ave, Inc. realized net sales of $18.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.0 million. 
● | In 2013, iFresh acquired Zen Mkt Quincy, Inc. (“Zen”) in Quincy, Massachusetts. The acquisition and renovation cost was $0.7 million. Prior to the Acquisition, the store realized $3.0 million in sales per year and made no profit. After the acquisition, iFresh improved its annual sales and profitability. Zen’s sales and adjusted EBITDA for the year ended March 31, 2017 were $10.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively.

For additional information on Adjusted EBITDA, see the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Adjusted EBITDA,” beginning on page 31.
 
Stores Site Selection — For new stores, iFresh has an established procedure to select new stores sites. First, iFresh contacts local real estate brokers and appraisers for demographic reports for a group of locations it is interested in. After reading the reports carefully, it narrows down the alternatives for further study. Next, it interviews with a diverse selection of influential local groups, including but not limited to, local Chinese associations, Chinese schools and local WeChat12 groups, to better understand local preference in food and grocery shopping. After further narrowing down the alternative sites, the iFresh team visits the target sites and conducts a field survey on the distribution, density and purchasing preferences of the local Chinese community. The team then runs systematic comparisons through acquiring cost and return analysis and investment feasibility evaluation on target alternatives, and reaches a conclusion on where to open the new store.
 
Figure 3 Procedure of Store Site Selection
 


Future Growth Prospects
 
iFresh plans to continue its vertically-integrated model and cultivate future growth by opening new stores, acquisition and developing online business. Geographically, iFresh plans to first expand along I-95 corridor based on its established logistics system and industry leadership, and then gradually go nationwide. For new stores, iFresh has already been approached by or has approached some targets for the purpose of possible acquisitions. Although it has no definitive agreements in place, iFresh has a detailed expansion plan in place. The current logistics network will also be coordinated to cover the new stores in the most efficient and economical way. In addition, iFresh stores in new locations will serve as distribution centers for its online shopping and delivery services to capture the growing Chinese population in large suburban areas.

Figure 4 Future Expansion Plan
 


iFresh will continue targeting stores averaging over 10,000 square feet. Based on its experience, iFresh expects that the average investment per store will be $2 million to $3.0 million and that the conversion period will be about 2 years, which means it will take about 2 years on average for newly acquired stores to enter into normal sales scale and profitability. In the aggregate, iFresh will need approximately $50 million of capital in addition to its cash flow in place for the year ended March 31, 2018 to fully execute the physical acquisitions, online platform development and new-store openings in the future.
Stores and Operation
 
iFresh offers well-assorted, high-quality and globally-sourced food products in its stores, with a special focus on perishable categories and hard-to-find products important to its target customers.
Store Layout
 
We believe that iFresh’s cultural advantage is unique in comparison with its mainstream peers. iFresh’s ability to identify, source, merchandise and market differentiated Asian and Chinese products that sharply meet the need of its target customers are critical to its success. Its centralized merchandising team rigorously rotates, updates and re-evaluates its existing merchandise offerings and regularly tests new products in retailing stores to excite its customers and to better understand customer preference. iFresh maintains a consistent flow of new products in its stores and keeps its product assortment fresh and relevant.
 
iFresh plans to use consistent decoration across all stores to emphasis iFresh’s brand and evoke a feeling of trustworthiness and consistent high-quality. It puts special focus on seafood and produce because their price and quality are key determining factors of Chinese or Asian customers’ shopping experience. Perishables in aggregate make up approximately 60% of store selling space on average. To optimize usage of available space, iFresh places popular items such as bok choy, lychee, longyan in most noticeable areas, and prices them competitively to attract customer traffic. The idea is to adopt a standardized product display with flexible arrangements customized to the shopping habits of local consumers.

iFresh has a significant focus on perishable product categories which include vegetables, seafood, fruit, meat and prepared foods. In fiscal year ended on March 31, 2017, the perishable categories contributed approximately 64% to iFresh’s total net sales, similar to 60.2% for the year ended March 31, 2016, in alignment with the space occupancy of perishables. The top three sales generators are vegetables, seafood and meat as shown in Table 4 below. iFresh’s focus on perishables came from its years of research and analysis of target customer’s shopping preferences. This also echoed well with conclusions given in Nielsen report that Asian and Chinese Americans prefer to buy fresh and shop for seafood and vegetables most often.
 
With respect to non-perishables, iFresh has over 6,600 grocery products on shelf ranging from cooking utensils, canned foods, Chinese and Asian seasonings and spices, to domestic and imported snacks. With a small-box format, iFresh is highly selective in its grocery offerings and is flexible enough to remove unprofitable or poor-selling items quickly. 95% of iFresh’s imported groceries are sourced from China, Thailand and Taiwan to meet the diverse demand of not only Chinese Americans but targeted customers originated from east and south-east Asia. In fiscal year ended on March 31, 2017, the non-perishable grocery category contributed approximately 36% to iFresh’s total Net Sales and realized a markup of 29% on average for the year ended March 31, 2017.
 
The table below depicts the components of net sales and gross margin in detail as of March 31, 2017:
 
Table 4 Contribution of Categories


Category | Net Sales % | | | Markup %
-------------------------+-------------+----+---+---------
Vegetables | | 21 | % | | 30 | %
Seafood | | 17 | % | | 21 | %
Meat | | 14 | % | | 29 | %
Fruit | | 10 | % | | 25 | %
Hot Food | | 3 | % | | 30 | %
Perishable Total/Average | | 64 | % | | 27 | %
Grocery | | 36 | % | | 29 | %

 
Management and sale of Perishables
 
Vegetables — All iFresh stores receive deliveries of vegetables every day and are required to sell out all vegetables on daily basis. iFresh discounts its vegetables after 7:00 p.m., which significantly lowers the storage cost and worn-and-torn rate and improves profitability. In addition, to lower the worn-out rate of green-leaf vegetables due to customer rummage, iFresh usually packs and sells such vegetables in bags. iFresh also displays and sells different kinds of vegetables according to their characteristics. For example, Chinese yams need to be displayed on wood shreds to keep them fresh, while winter melons are typically sold in pieces due to their large size.
 
Seafood — As an established procedure, in-house merchants of iFresh collect live seafood from wharfs and markets at midnight on a daily basis. The purchases are immediately distributed to all retailing stores via iFresh’s in-house cold chain systems in which hibernation technology keeps seafood alive and ensures their freshness and high-quality. iFresh discounts remaining stock after 7pm, to make space for new deliveries, reduce storage costs and maintain its standard for freshness and quality.
 
Meat— Since iFresh can sell more body parts of an animal than a mainstream grocery store, the sales it generates from a whole pig, chicken or cattle are much higher than that of mainstream groceries, which leads to higher margin in meat and meat products sales.
 
Fruit— Almost all of the iFresh’s unique fruit species are seasonal offerings and the quality and price are decisive to customer traffic during high season. Financially, the unique fruit species are sold at higher unit prices and generally offer higher profit margins. iFresh benefits from its long-standing relationship with farm vendors to stay competitive in high seasons and enjoy better sourcing price and higher profit margin from fruit sales.

Hot Food — Hot food options vary among iFresh’s different store locations. iFresh provides prepared Chinese cuisines which require specific cooking utensils and are thus not easily made at home by customers, such as Char Siu, qingtuan, roasted duck, roasted goose, as well as an assortment of dim sums. In addition, iFresh adjusts its hot food offerings periodically based on the responses from customers. As a commitment to freshness and quality, all prepared food in iFresh are made and sold on a daily basis. Leftovers are sold at a discount after 7:00 p.m.
 
Pricing Strategy
 
In general, iFresh’s pricing strategy is to provide premium products at reasonable prices. iFresh believes pricing should be based on the quality of products and the shopping experience rather than promotional pricing to drive sales. Its goal is to deliver a sense of value to and foster a relationship of trust with its target and loyal customers.
 
iFresh adopts different pricing strategies for different food categories. For best sellers such as seafood and core produce such as swimming shrimp and bok choy, iFresh prices competitively and aims to attract consumer traffic. For groceries and dry foods which are usually imported and have a long shelf life, iFresh prices at a premium (average markup of 40%). Due to changes in market conditions and seasonal supply, iFresh’s pricing for seafood and produce are more volatile when compared with other categories. Despite the effects of seasonality, iFresh is able to maintain competitive pricing even in high seasons thanks to its long-standing relationship with its farm partners.
 
Marketing and advertising
 
iFresh believes its unique offerings, competitive price of popular produce, and word-of–mouth are major drivers of store sales. Apart from word-of-mouth, iFresh advertises using in-store tastings, in-store weekly promotion signage, cooking demonstrations and product sampling. iFresh also promotes its stores on its official website, uses an electronic newsletter, and/or inserts sales flyers in local Chinese newspapers or magazines on a monthly or weekly basis. iFresh’s online business is marketed mainly on its official website and on WeChat, the most widely-used mobile social app among Chinese immigrations. As of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017and 2016, iFresh recognized $533,536 and $572,885 for marketing and advertising expenses, respectively. Overall, iFresh utilized a mixed marketing and advertising methods to enhance iFresh brand and sales, to regularly communicate with its target customers and to strengthen its ability to market new and differentiated products.
 
Store Staffing and Operations
 
iFresh adopts a systematic approach to support operations and the sustainable development of stores. The comprehensive support includes, but is not limited to, employee training and scheduling, store design, layout, product sourcing and inventory management systems, especially focusing on perishables. The support enables iFresh to lower worn-and-tear rate, to enhance operating margins and profit and to help build iFresh’s image of a Chinese supermarket chain committed to freshness and high-quality.
 
Each iFresh retail supermarket is operated with high autonomy. A store manager oversees the general operation and an assistant manager is also appointed to assist the supervision. To ensure expertise in management and high quality of offerings, department managers are also appointed by category at each store. The department managers in each store generally include a vegetable manager, a fruit manager, a seafood manager, a meat manager, a grocery manager and a hot food manager. Since a department manager shoulders the detailed management for the specific category he or she is in charge of, he or she is commonly experienced in this category or has been with iFresh for years and exhibited superior performance. As a group, the store manager and store department managers help to ensure the quality of iFresh’s offerings.
 
Competition
 
Food retail is a large and highly competitive industry, but we believe that the market participants in the Chinese supermarket industry, a niche market are highly fragmented and immature. Currently, iFresh faces competition from smaller or dispersed competitors focusing on the niche market of Chinese and other Asian consumers. However, with the rapid growth of the Chinese and other Asian population and their consumption power, other competitors may also begin operating in this niche market in the future. Those competitors include: (i) national conventional supermarkets, (ii) regional supermarkets, (iii) national superstores, (iv) alternative food retailers, (v) local foods stores, (vi) small specialty stores, and (vii) farmers’ markets.

18
--

 

The national and regional supermarket chains are experienced in operating multiple store locations, expansion management and have greater marketing or financial resources than iFresh does. Even though currently they offer only a limited selection of Chinese and Asian specialty foods, they may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products if they choose to do so. The local food stores and markets are small in size with a deep understanding of local preferences. Their lack of scale results in high risk and limited growth potential.
 
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 
iFresh owns ten self-owned Trademarks: (i) Family Elephant; (ii) Feiyan; (iii) Green Acre; (iv) Golden Smell; (v) Redolent; (vi) Shuangdeng/Double Lantern Brand; (vii) SeaStar; (viii) Huang Duan Xiang 1987; (ix) I FRESH; and (x) I FRESH. The first four trademarks have been registered with the United Stated Patent and Trademark Office, the latter six were filed throughout 2015 and 2017 and are awaiting approval. iFresh’s self-owned trademarks cover rice and rice products and seasonings and spices, as well as assortment of noodles, frozen vegetables, frozen dumplings and frozen seafood. Trademarks are generally renewed for a 10-year period. We consider iFresh’s trademarks to be valuable assets that diversify customer’s value alternatives, a useful strategy to enhance profit margins and an important way to establish and protect iFresh brand in a competitive environment.
 
iFresh plans to acquire more brands or even develop NYM-branded products in the near future. iFresh will evaluate the acquisition opportunities on a case by case basis, considering the timing, impact to current products and the product quality. iFresh is not currently in any trademark disputes with any third party.
 
Insurance
 
iFresh uses insuranc to provide coverage for potential liability for worker’s compensation, automobile and general liability, product liability, director and officers’ liability, employee health care benefits and other casualty and property risks. Changes in legal trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency or insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect ultimate settlements of claims. iFresh evaluates its insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure it maintains adequate levels of coverage. 
Properties


iFresh’s headquarters has been located in Long Island City since 1999. The head office is leased at current market rate from a real estate company in which our Chief Executive Officer, Long Deng, has a significant equity interest. The headquarter and the attached warehouse spaces are located in a desirable area in New York City’s up and coming Hunters Point neighborhood . The space can be easily rented to or sold to any third party if not used by us. All of our retail supermarkets lease operating space from various third parties with which we maintain long-term leases averaging approximately 11.9 years. Five of the ten current leases have remaining periods of at least 10 years; and the rest five current leases come with a renewal option ranging from 10 to 20 years. New York Mart Group rents 20,000 square feet of storage from third parties, while Strong America rents 60,000 square feet of storage from a real estate company in which Long Deng, iFresh’s Director, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, has a significant equity and control.

Employees
 
As of March 31, 2017, we had approximately 480 employees, 435 of whom are full-time employees and the remaining 55 of whom work part-time. We have 60 employees who have worked for it for 10 years or more. Our employees are not unionized nor, to our knowledge, are there any plans for them to unionize. We have never experienced a strike or significant work stoppage. iFresh regards its employee relations to be good.
Seasonality
 
As with other participants in the food retail industry, iFresh’s sales are affected by seasonality. First, weekly sales fluctuate throughout the year, with weekends generating more sales over weekdays. Weekends enable customers living further from iFresh’s stores to shop in iFresh’s stores.
 
iFresh also has higher sales in its third fiscal quarter when customers make holiday purchases. In contrast to conventional supermarkets, iFresh’s are not only affected by U.S. holidays, but by traditional Chinese holidays as well, such as the Spring Festival (in January or February), the Dragon Boat Festival (in June), and the Mid-Autumn Festival (in September or October). Each of the Chinese festivals features a specific traditional food which will bevery popular just prior to or at the holiday season. Therefore, iFresh observes not only a general sales increase but also a sharp sales increase for that traditional Chinese food related to the festival.
 
iFresh’s target customers also believe that food in season is the best. Therefore, popular species of vegetables, fruit and seafood change with season. For example, iFresh target customers will look for longyan and lychee in summer but not in winter even if they are on shelf; similarly, customers look for Chinese dates and sugar cane in winter but never in summer. The seasonality in both customer demand and supply has a direct impact on iFresh’s merchandising, pricing, sales and profitability.

Regulation
 
iFresh operates in multiple states and is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in states it operates. Particularly, the jurisdictions in which it operates regulate the licensing of supermarkets, the sale of alcoholic beverages and the sale of lotteries. iFresh must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food labeling, licensing for alcoholic beverages and lottery sales. The manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of product are subject to regulation by various federal agencies including the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Agriculture, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency. iFresh stores are subject to regular but unscheduled inspections. iFresh stores are also subject to laws governing its relationship with employees including minimum wage requirement, overtime, working conditions, immigration, disabled access and work permit requirements. Certain of iFresh’s parking lots and warehouses and its prepared food sections either have temporary certificates of occupancy or are awaiting certificates of occupancy. In addition, a number of federal, state and local laws impose requirements or restrictions on business owners with respect to access by disabled persons. iFresh believes that it is in material compliance with laws and regulations in each jurisdiction. iFresh’s compliance with these regulations may require additional capital expenditures and could materially adversely affect its ability to conduct business as planned.
Legal Proceedings
 
In the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to periodic lawsuits, investigations and claims, including, but not limited to, contractual disputes, premises claims and employment, environmental, health, safety and intellectual property matters. Although we cannot predict certainty the ultimate resolution of any lawsuits, investigations and claims asserted against it, we do not believe any currently pending legal proceedings to which it is a party will have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations other than the following:
Rent Dispute


Ming’s Supermarket, Inc. (“Ming”), the subsidiary of us, is a tenant at a building located at 140–148 East Berkeley Street, Boston, MA (the “Property”), pursuant to a lease dated September 24, 1999 (the “Lease”). The Lease had a 10-year initial term, followed by an option for two additional 10-year terms. Ming has exercised that first option and the Lease has approximately 15 years remaining if the second option is also exercised. The Lease gives Ming a right of first refusal on any sale of the building.
 
On February 22, 2015 a sprinkler pipe burst in the Property. This caused the Inspectional Services Department of the City of Boston (“ISD”) to inspect the Property. The ISD found a number of problems which have prevented further use of the Property. The ISD notified both the landlord and the tenant that the Property was originally only permitted for use as an elevator garage, that its use as a warehouse was never permitted, and that a conditional use permit must be obtained from the City of Boston to make such use lawful. Moreover, the Property was found to have major structural issues requiring repair, as well as repairs being needed to the elevator and outside glass. The result of the ISD’s findings was that Ming was ordered not to use the Property for any purpose unless and until the structural and other repairs are completed and a permit is granted from the Boston Zoning Board.
 
While the Lease provides that the elevator (approximate repair cost $400,000) and outside glass (approximate repair cost $30,000) are the responsibility of the tenant, the structural repairs (approximate cost $500,000) are the landlord’s responsibility under the Lease, unless the structural damage was caused by the tenant’s misuse of the Property. In this regard Ming retained an expert who will testify the structural damage to the building was caused by long term water infiltration and is not the result of Ming’s activities. Ming initially requested that the landlord perform the structural repairs and indicated that upon completion of those repairs, Ming would repair the elevator and the broken glass. In addition, Ming asked the landlord’s cooperation in obtaining the permit to use the Property as a warehouse.
 
The landlord refused to either perform structural repairs or to cooperate on the permitting. As a result, as of April 2015, Ming stopped paying the landlord rent because it could not use the Property by order of the ISD. The landlord then sued Ming for breach of the Lease and unpaid rent in the Superior Court of Suffolk County in the State of Massachusetts and Ming counterclaimed for constructive eviction and for damages resulting from the landlord’s breach of its duty to perform structural repairs under the Lease.
 
It would appear the landlord wishes to use the current circumstances to terminate the lease or to cause Ming to abandon it. The Lease is at considerably below market and impairs the landlord’s ability to sell the Property for a high price. The landlord is claiming damages of approximately $470,000 in unpaid rent and additional rent charges under the lease to date, plus for the cost of repairs. Ming is claiming damages in the mount of lost profits of $20,000 to$30,000 per month resulting from the loss of its warehouse space and for the landlord’s failure to undertake its responsibilities under the lease. Ming’s damages also include loss of the benefit of its below market lease. Ming is also seeking an order of the Court directing the landlord to perform the structural repairs.
 
The parties have been unable to agree on terms of a settlement and a trial will be needed to resolve this matter. A trial date of July 24, 2017 has been scheduled.
 
Given the complicated fact pattern and myriad of claims and counterclaims, a reasonable and probable estimate as to the potential exposure, if any, cannot be made at this time. While Ming is vigorously contesting any liability on its part for unpaid rent and believes that it will recover damages against the landlord due to Ming’s constructive eviction from the Property. The ultimate outcome of this case is uncertain.

While discovery is ongoing and no guaranties or predications can be made at this time as to ultimate outcome, the Company believes that the facts and the law are favorable for Ming's as to both its continuing liability for rent and its affirmative claim to recover damages.
 
Trade order dispute
 
A lawsuit has been filed against New York Mart Group, Inc. (”NYMG”), a subsidiary of iFresh, and New Sunshine Group, LLC (“New Sunshine”), by SKKR Trading, LLC (“Plaintiff”) for breach of contract and failure to pay. The plaintiff is seeking from NYMG and New Sunshine for principal damages in the amount of $116,878 representing the total amount of invoices Plaintiff is claiming pass due, penalty of $256,000 for the past due invoices and attorney cost which was estimated to be $80,000 to $90,000.
 
The Plaintiff claimed that NYMG and New Sunshine failed to pay for a shrimp order. NYMG and New Sunshine have raised various defenses, most of which center on the arguments that NYMG and New Sunshine abandoned the Distribution Agreement and did not order, receive or benefit from the shrimp at issue. Rather, the shrimp was ordered by a tenant of NYMG, Hong Hai, who was a completely separate corporation than NYMG or New Sunshine.
 
The case went to trial on March 12 to15, 2017. On April 17, 2017, the Count ruled in favor of Plaintiff and against NYMG and New Sunshine in the amount of $385,492. NYMG hired a new law firm to appeal the case because it believes that there are new evidences and arguments that NYMG should not be held responsible for these damages. The appeal process will take approximately one year. During the appeal, NYMG will not be required to pay the amount under the Final Judgment.
 
While discovery is ongoing and no guaranties or predications can be made at this time as to ultimate outcome, the Company and its attorney believe a fair estimate of the chance the Company will prevail on the appeal of the Final Judgment is approximately 50%. The principal shareholder of the Company, Mr. Long Deng, made a personal pledge to pay for the entire amount of the damage if the appeal is ruled against NYMG. The Company did not accrue any of this potential liability.


ITEM 1 A. Risk Factors
 
An investment in our Common Stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, before deciding to invest in our Common Stock. Any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect iFresh’s business, prospects, sales, revenues, gross profit, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
iFresh’s continued growth depends on new store acquisitions and openings and on increasing same store sales, and iFresh’s failure to achieve these goals could negatively impact its results of operations and financial condition.
 
Our growth strategy depends, in large part, on acquiring and opening new stores in existing and new areas and operating those stores successfully. Successful implementation of this strategy is dependent on sufficient capital support from financing, finding suitable stores to acquire, identifying suitable locations and negotiating acceptable lease terms for store sites, as it faces competition from other retailers for such sites. There can be no assurance that we will continue to grow through new store acquisitions and openings. We may not be able to obtain sufficient capital support for the expansion plan, or successfully implement the plan to acquire or open new stores timely or within budget or operate them successfully, and there can be no assurance that store acquisition or opening costs for, net sales of, contribution margin of and average payback period on initial investment for new stores will conform to our operating model discussed elsewhere in this report. Lower contribution margins from new stores, along with the impact of related store acquisition, opening and store management relocation costs, may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. In addition, if we acquire stores in the future, it may not be able to successfully integrate those stores into its existing store base and those stores may not be as profitable as its existing stores.
 
Also, we may not be able to successfully hire, train and retain new store employees or integrate those employees into the programs, policies and culture of us. We or our third party vendors may not be able to adapt our distribution, management and other operating systems to adequately supply products to new stores at competitive prices so that we can operate the stores in a successful and profitable manner. We may not have the level of cash flow or financing necessary to support our growth strategy.
 
Additionally, our acquisition and opening of new stores will place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources. These increased demands could cause the Company to operate its existing business less effectively, which in turn could cause deterioration in the financial performance of our existing stores. If the Company experiences a decline in performance, it may slow or discontinue store openings, or may decide to close stores that it is unable to operate in a profitable manner.
 
Additionally, some of our new stores may be located in areas where the Company has little experience or a lack of brand recognition. Those markets may have different competitive conditions, market conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, which may cause these new stores to be less successful than stores in our existing markets.
 
Our operating results and stock price will be adversely affected if we fail to implement our growth strategy or if we invest resources in a growth strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful.

Our newly opened stores may negatively impact our financial results in the short-term and may not achieve sales and operating levels consistent with our mature store base on a timely basis or at all.
 
The Company has actively pursued new store growth and plans to continue doing so in the future. The Company cannot assure you that its new store acquisitions or openings will be successful or result in greater sales and profitability. New store openings may negatively impact our financial results in the short-term due to the effect of store opening costs and lower sales and contribution margin during the initial period following opening. New stores build their sales volume and their customer base over time and, as a result, generally have lower margins and higher operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, than our more mature stores. A new store can take more than a year to achieve a level of operating performance comparable to our similarly existing stores. Further, we have experienced in the past, and expect to experience in the future, some sales volume transfer from our existing stores to our new stores as some of our existing customers switch to new, closer locations. As a result, part of the increase of the overall sales to us arising from a new store opening or a store acquisition may be offset by the “sales volume transfer” phenomena.
 
The competition from competitors may increase intensively in the future.
 
Food retail is a large and highly competitive industry. However, iFresh believes that the market participants in the Chinese supermarket industry are highly fragmented and immature. Currently, iFresh faces competition from smaller or dispersed competitors focusing on the niche market of Chinese consumers. However, with the rapid growth of the Chinese and other Asian population and their consumption power, other competitors may also begin operating in this niche market in the future. Those competitors include: (i) national conventional supermarkets, (ii) regional supermarkets, (iii) national superstores, (iv) alternative food retailers, (v) local foods stores, (vi) small specialty stores, and (vii) farmers’ markets.
 
The national and regional supermarket chains are experienced in operating multiple stores locations, expanding management and they have greater marketing or financial resources than iFresh does. Even though they currently offer only a limited selection of Chinese and Asian specialty foods, they may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products if they choose to do so. On the contrary, the local food stores and markets are small in size with a deep understanding of local preferences, but their lack of scale results in high risk and limited growth potential.
 
If more and more competitors devote into this market segment aiming to serve Chinese and other Asian customers in the future, the competition will increase. Our operating results may be negatively impacted through a loss of sales, reduction in margin from competitive price changes and/or greater operating costs such as marketing, due to the increase of competition.
 
iFresh relies on a combination of product offerings, customer service, store format, location and pricing to compete.
 
iFresh competes with other food retailers on a combination of factors, primarily product selection and quality, customer service, store layout and decoration, location and price. Our success depends on its ability to offer products that appeal to its customers’ preferences. Failure to offer such products, or to accurately forecast changing customer preferences, could lead to a decrease in the number of customer transactions at Our stores and in the amount customers spend at our stores.
 
Pricing in particular is a significant driver of consumer choice in Our industry and iFresh expects competitors to continue to apply pricing and other competitive pressures. To the extent that Ourcompetitors lower prices, its ability to maintain gross profit margins and sales levels may be negatively impacted. Some of Our competitors may have greater resources than it does. These competitors could use these advantages to take measures, including reducing prices, which could adversely affect Our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations.
 
If iFresh does not succeed in offering attractively priced products that consumers intend to purchase or are unable to provide a convenient and appealing shopping experience, Our sales, operating margins and market share may decrease, resulting in reduced profitability.
 
Economic conditions that impact consumer spending could materially affect Our business.
 
Ongoing economic uncertainty continues to negatively affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending. iFresh’s operating results may be materially affected by changes in economic conditions nationwide or in the regions in which iFresh operates that impact consumer confidence and spending, including discretionary spending. This risk may be exacerbated if customers choose lower-cost alternatives to iFresh’s product offerings in response to economic conditions. In particular, a decrease in discretionary spending could adversely impact sales of certain of iFresh’s higher margin product offerings. Future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income, such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, the availability of consumer credit, interest rates, tax rates and fuel and energy costs, could reduce overall consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to lower-priced competitors. In addition, inflation or deflation can impact iFresh’s business. Food deflation could reduce sales growth and earnings, while food inflation, combined with reduced consumer spending, could reduce gross profit margins. As a result, iFresh’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

iFresh’s existing stores are mainly located in Northeastern American metropolitan areas. The geographic concentration of its stores creates an exposure to the economy of the Northeastern United States and any downturn in this region could materially adversely affect iFresh’s financial condition and results of operations.
 
Perishable products make up a significant portion of iFresh’s sales, and ordering errors or product supply disruptions may have an adverse effect on iFresh’s profitability and operating results.
 
iFresh has a significant focus on perishable products. Sales of perishable products accounted for approximately 64% of iFresh’s net sales in fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. iFresh has self-owned wholesale facilities and stable supply relationship with farm partners, which significantly reduces ordering errors and product disruption. However, iFresh still relies on various suppliers and vendors to provide and deliver its product inventory on a continuous basis. iFresh could suffer significant perishable product inventory losses in the event of the loss of a major supplier or vendor, disruption of its supply chain, extended power outages, natural disasters or other catastrophic occurrences. While iFresh has implemented certain systems to ensure that its ordering is in line with demand, it cannot assure you that its ordering systems will always work efficiently, in particular in connection with the new additional stores, which have no, or a limited, ordering history. If iFresh were to over-order, it could suffer inventory losses, which would negatively impact its operating results.
 
Interruption of exclusive distribution of brands or imports relating to iFresh’s wholesale operations may adversely impact iFresh’s financial conditions and operating results.
 
iFresh conducts wholesale business through its two subsidiaries, Strong America and NYMG, which enables iFresh to have stronger negotiating power with vendors as well as a way to source products from China, Thailand and Taiwan to its own retail stores. Strong America is also the exclusive distributor of nine famous oversea brands. If iFresh can’t renew its exclusive distribution contracts relating to those brands, iFresh’s sales, both retail and wholesale, may be adversely affected. Furthermore, importing products from other countries is subject to the impact of various international factors, including international trading polices, shipping costs, currency fluctuations, tariffs and customs procedures for imports, which may affect the supply and purchase prices of the products to be imported by iFresh’s wholesale distributors and sold by them to iFresh. If iFresh fails to obtain or maintain a sustainable supply of these products from its vendors, its financial conditions and operating results will be adversely impacted.
 
The operation of new stores and online sales may cannibalize sales in iFresh’s stores and its financial results can be affected by economic and competitive conditions in this area.
 
All of iFresh’s existing stores are located in the Northeastern United States and it intends to grow its store base in this area. New stores are expected to be opened in the Greater New York City and Boston metropolitan areas. As iFresh opens new stores in closer proximity to its customers who currently travel longer distances to shop at iFresh’s stores, iFresh expects some of these customers to take advantage of the convenience of iFresh’s new locations. Simultaneously, iFresh will develop online sales to cover the customers living in a 2.5-hour drive radius, which may satisfy the demand from those Chinese customers living in the suburbs.
 
Some sales volume may transfer from iFresh’s existing stores to its new stores as some of its existing customers switch to these new, closer locations, or convenient online shopping. Consequently, iFresh’s new stores and online sales may adversely impact sales at iFresh’s existing stores.

Disruption of relationships with vendors could negatively affect iFresh’s business.
 
iFresh purchases vegetables and fruits directly from farms and other vendors and maintains stable relationships with the vendors to ensure reliable supplies of popular seasonal Chinese specialty of vegetables and fruits. iFresh also depends on third-party suppliers for exclusive third-party brands. The cancellation of iFresh’s supply arrangement with any of its suppliers or the disruption, delay or inability in supply from its suppliers could adversely affect iFresh’s sales. If iFresh’s suppliers fail to comply with food safety or other laws and regulations, or face allegations of non-compliance, their operations may be disrupted. iFresh cannot assure you that it would be able to find replacement suppliers on commercially reasonable terms.
 
iFresh may be unable to protect or maintain its intellectual property, which could result in customer confusion, a negative perception of its brand and adversely affect its business.
 
iFresh believes that its intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of iFresh’s business. In particular, iFresh’s trademarks, including New York Mart, are valuable assets that reinforce iFresh’s customers’ favorable perception of its stores.
 
From time to time, third parties have used names similar to iFresh’s, have applied to register trademarks similar to iFresh’s and, as iFresh believes, have infringed or misappropriated iFresh’s intellectual property rights. iFresh responds to these actions on a case-by-case basis, including, where appropriate, by sending cease and desist letters and commencing opposition actions and litigation. The outcomes of these actions have included both negotiated out-of-court settlements as well as litigation. iFresh cannot assure you that the steps it has taken to protect its intellectual property rights are adequate, that its intellectual property rights can be successfully defended and asserted in the future or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate any such rights. In addition, iFresh’s trademark rights and related registrations may be challenged in the future and could be canceled or narrowed. Failure to protect iFresh’s trademark rights could prevent iFresh in the future from challenging third parties who use names and logos similar to iFresh’s trademarks, which may in turn cause consumer confusion or negatively affect consumers’ perception of iFresh’s brand and products, and eventually adversely affect iFresh’s sales and profitability. Moreover, intellectual property disputes and proceedings and infringement claims may result in a significant distraction for management and significant expense, which may not be recoverable regardless of whether iFresh is successful. Such proceedings may be protracted with no certainty of success, and an adverse outcome could subject iFresh to liabilities, force iFresh to cease use of certain trademarks or other intellectual property or force iFresh to enter into licenses with others. Any one of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on iFresh’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
If iFresh experiences a data security breach and confidential customer information is disclosed, iFresh may be subject to penalties and experience negative publicity, which could affect iFresh’s customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on its business.
 
iFresh and its customers could suffer harm if customer information was accessed by third parties due to a security failure in iFresh’s systems. The collection of data and processing of transactions requires iFresh to receive, transmit and store a large amount of personally identifiable and transaction related data. This type of data is subject to legislation and regulation in various jurisdictions. Recently, data security breaches suffered by well-known companies and institutions have attracted a substantial amount of media attention, prompting state and federal legislative proposals addressing data privacy and security. If some of the current proposals are adopted, iFresh may be subject to more extensive requirements to protect the customer information that it processes in connection with the purchases of iFresh’s products. iFresh may become exposed to potential liability with respect to the data that it collects, manages and processes, and may incur legal costs if its information security policies and procedures are not effective or if it is required to defend its methods of collection, processing and storage of personal data. Future investigations, lawsuits or adverse publicity relating to iFresh’s methods of handling personal data could adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows due to the costs and negative market reaction relating to such developments. Additionally, if iFresh suffers data breaches, one or more of the credit card processing companies that it relies on may refuse to allow it to continue to participate in their network, which would limit iFresh’s ability to accept credit cards at its stores and could adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Data theft, information espionage or other criminal activity directed at the retail industry or computer or communications systems may materially adversely affect iFresh’s business by causing iFresh to implement costly security measures in recognition of actual or potential threats, by requiring iFresh to expend significant time and expense developing, maintaining or upgrading its information technology systems and by causing it to incur significant costs to reimburse third parties for damages. Such activities may also materially adversely affect iFresh’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by reducing consumer confidence in the marketplace and by modifying consumer spending habits.
 
If iFresh is unable to renew or replace current store leases or if it is unable to enter into leases for additional stores on favorable terms, or if one or more of its current leases are terminated prior to expiration of their stated term, and it cannot find suitable alternate locations, iFresh’s growth and profitability could be negatively impacted.
 
iFresh currently leases all of its store locations. Many of iFresh’s current leases provide unilateral option to renew for several additional rental periods at specific rental rates. iFresh’s ability to re-negotiate favorable terms on an expiring lease or to negotiate favorable terms for a suitable alternate location, and iFresh’s ability to negotiate favorable lease terms for additional store locations, could depend on conditions in the real estate market, competition for desirable properties, its relationships with current and prospective landlords, or other factors that are not within iFresh’s control. Any or all of these factors and conditions could negatively impact iFresh’s growth and profitability.
 
iFresh leases certain of its stores and related properties from related parties.
 
Long Deng, one of iFresh’s directors and executive officers, owns 50% of Dragon Development LLC, which leases to iFresh the premises at which Strong America, one of iFresh’s wholesale subsidiaries, is located. During fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, rental payments (excluding maintenance and taxes that iFresh is obligated to pay) under the leases from Dragon Development LLC were $637,273. The leases with Dragon Development LLC renewed on May 1, 2016, and their remaining terms are 10 years. iFresh has no assurance that these related parties will renew the lease agreements with it after expiration. If iFresh cannot renew the leases, it will have to move its stores and warehouses locations, which increases the uncertainty of finding suitable locations for those stores and the reputation recognition in new locations, which may adversely affect iFresh’s sales, expenses, profit and financial position.
 
Failure to retain iFresh’s senior management and other key personnel may adversely affect its operations.
 
iFresh’s success is substantially dependent on the continued service of its senior management and other key personnel. These executives, and in particular Long Deng, iFresh’s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, have been primarily responsible for determining the strategic direction of iFresh’s business and for executing its growth strategy and are integral to its brand and culture, and the reputation iFresh enjoys with suppliers and consumers. The loss of the services of any of these executives and other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on iFresh’s business and prospects, as iFresh may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts, which may cause iFresh’s stock price to decline. The loss of key employees could negatively affect iFresh’s business.
 
If iFresh is unable to attract, train and retain employees, it may not be able to grow or successfully operate its business.
 
The retail store industry is labor intensive, and iFresh’s success depends in part upon its ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of employees who understand and appreciate iFresh’s culture and are able to represent its brand effectively and establish credibility with its business partners and consumers. iFresh’s ability to meet its labor needs, while controlling wage and labor-related costs, is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force in the markets in which iFresh is located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation. In the event of increasing wage rates, if iFresh fails to increase its wages competitively, the quality of its workforce could decline, causing its customer service to suffer, while increasing its wages could cause its earnings to decrease. If iFresh is unable to hire and retain employees capable of meeting its business needs and expectations, its business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet iFresh’s staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of iFresh’s employees may adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.

Changes in and enforcement of immigration laws could increase iFresh’s costs and adversely affect iFresh’s ability to attract and retain qualified store-level employees.
 
Federal and state governments from time to time implement immigration laws, regulations or programs that regulate iFresh’s ability to attract or retain qualified foreign employees. Some of these changes may increase iFresh’s obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject iFresh to additional costs and make iFresh’s hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although iFresh has implemented, and is in the process of enhancing, procedures to ensure its compliance with the employment eligibility verification requirements, there can be no assurance that these procedures are adequate and some of its employees may, without iFresh’s knowledge, be unauthorized workers. The employment of unauthorized workers may subject iFresh to fines or civil or criminal penalties, and if any of iFresh’s workers are found to be unauthorized, iFresh could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts its brand and makes it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. iFresh may be required to terminate the employment of certain of its employees who were determined to be unauthorized workers. The termination of a significant number of employees may disrupt iFresh’s operations, cause temporary increases in iFresh’s labor costs as it trains new employees and result in additional adverse publicity. iFresh’s financial performance could be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors.
 
Prolonged labor disputes with employees and increases in labor costs could adversely affect iFresh’s business.
 
A considerable amount of iFresh’s operating costs is attributable to labor costs and, therefore, its financial performance is greatly influenced by increases in wage and benefit costs, including pension and health care costs. As a result, iFresh is exposed to risks associated with a competitive labor market. Rising health care and pension costs and the nature and structure of work rules will be important issues. Any work stoppages or labor disturbances as a result of employees’ dissatisfaction of their current employment terms could have a material adverse effect on iFresh’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. iFresh also expects that in the event of a work stoppage or labor disturbance, it could incur additional costs and face increased competition.
 
Various aspects of iFresh’s business are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations. iFresh’s compliance with these regulations may require additional capital expenditures and could materially adversely affect its ability to conduct its business as planned.
 
iFresh is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning, land use, environmental protection, workplace safety, food safety, public health, community right-to-know and alcoholic beverage and tobacco sales. In particular, the states in which iFresh operates and several local jurisdictions regulate the licensing of supermarkets and the sale of alcoholic beverages. In addition, certain local regulations may limit iFresh’s ability to sell alcoholic beverages at certain times. iFresh is also subject to laws governing its relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, immigration, disabled access and work permit requirements. Compliance with new laws in these areas, or with new or stricter interpretations of existing requirements, could reduce the revenue and profitability of iFresh’s stores and could otherwise materially adversely affect iFresh’s business, financial condition or results of operations. iFresh’s new store openings could be delayed or prevented or its existing stores could be impacted by difficulties or failures in iFresh’s ability to obtain or maintain required approvals or licenses. iFresh’s stores are subject to unscheduled inspections on a regular basis, which, if violations are found, could result in the assessment of fines, suspension of one or more needed licenses and, in the case of repeated “critical” violations, closure of the store until a re-inspection demonstrates that iFresh has remediated the problem. Certain of iFresh’s parking lots and warehouses either have only temporary certificates of occupancy or are awaiting a certificate of occupancy which, if not granted, would require iFresh to stop using such property. Additionally, a number of federal, state and local laws impose requirements or restrictions on business owners with respect to access by disabled persons. iFresh’s compliance with these laws may result in modifications to iFresh’s properties, or prevent iFresh from performing certain further renovations. iFresh cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, or determine what effect either additional government regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state and local regulatory schemes would have on iFresh’s business in the future.

iFresh’s plans to acquire and open new stores requires iFresh to spend capital. Failure to use its capital efficiently could have an adverse effect on iFresh’s profitability.
 
iFresh’s growth strategy depends on its acquisition of and opening new stores, which will require iFresh to use cash generated by its operations and a portion of the net proceeds of future equity or debt financing and borrowing under bank credit line. iFresh cannot assure you that cash generated by its operations, the net proceeds of future equity or debt financing and borrowing under bank credit line will be sufficient to allow iFresh to implement its growth strategy. If any of these initiatives prove to be unsuccessful, iFresh may experience reduced profitability and it could be required to delay, significantly curtail or eliminate planned store openings, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and future operating performance and the price of its common stock.
 
Litigation may materially adversely affect iFresh’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
iFresh’s operations are characterized by a high volume of customer traffic and by transactions involving a wide variety of product selections. These operations carry a higher exposure to consumer litigation risk when compared to the operations of companies operating in many other industries. Consequently, iFresh may be a party to individual personal injury, product liability and other legal actions in the ordinary course of its business, including litigation arising from food-related illness. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease consumer confidence in iFresh’s businesses, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether iFresh is ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may materially adversely affect iFresh’s businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 
Increased commodity prices and availability may impact profitability.
 
Many of iFresh’s products include ingredients such as wheat, corn, oils, milk, sugar, cocoa and other commodities. Commodity prices worldwide have been increasing. While commodity price inputs do not typically represent the substantial majority of iFresh’s product costs, any increase in commodity prices may cause its vendors to seek price increases from iFresh. Although iFresh is typically able to mitigate vendor efforts to increase its costs, it may be unable to continue to do so, either in whole or in part. In the event iFresh is unable to continue mitigating potential vendor price increases, it may in turn consider raising its prices, and its customers may be deterred by any such price increases. iFresh’s profitability may be impacted through increased costs to it which may impact gross margins, or through reduced revenue as a result of a decline in the number and average size of customer transactions.
 
Severe weather, natural disasters and adverse climate changes may materially adversely affect iFresh’s financial condition and results of operations.
 
Severe weather conditions and other natural disasters in areas where iFresh has stores or from which iFresh obtains the products it sells may materially adversely affect its retail operations or its product offerings and, therefore, its results of operations. Such conditions may result in physical damage to, or temporary or permanent closure of, one or more of iFresh’s stores, an insufficient work force in iFresh’s markets and/or temporary disruption in the supply of products, including delays in the delivery of goods to iFresh’s stores or a reduction in the availability of products in its stores. In addition, adverse climate conditions and adverse weather patterns, such as drought or flood, that impact growing conditions and the quantity and quality of crops may materially adversely affect the availability or cost of certain products within its supply chain. Any of these factors may disrupt iFresh’s businesses and materially adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The occurrence of a widespread health epidemic may materially adversely affect iFresh’s financial condition and results of operations.
 
iFresh’s business may be severely impacted by wartime activities, threats or acts of terror or a widespread regional, national or global health epidemic, such as pandemic flu. Such activities, threats or epidemics may materially adversely impact iFresh’s business by disrupting production and delivery of products to iFresh’s stores, by affecting iFresh’s ability to appropriately staff its stores or by causing customers to avoid public gathering places or otherwise change their shopping behaviors.
 
iFresh needs approximately $50 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 in order to achieve its planned growth for that year and if it cannot successfully obtain sufficient capital, the financial results and stock price of iFresh after the business combination will be adversely affected.
 
iFresh believes that it needs approximately $50 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 mainly for the purpose of acquiring additional stores to achieve its planned growth for that year. If it is not able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms in connection with the Business Combination, as is contemplated by the parties, it may not be able to implement its growth plan. If it is unable to effect its growth plan, iFresh’s financial results will be significantly worse than anticipated and its stock price may decline as a result.
 
iFresh is an “emerging growth company” and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make its securities less attractive to investors.
 
iFresh is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. It may remain an “emerging growth company” until the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. However, if its non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period or revenues exceeds $1 billion, or the market value of its common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, iFresh would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, iFresh is not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, has reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and is exempt from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Additionally, as an emerging growth company, iFresh has elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As such, iFresh’s financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. As a result, potential investors may be less likely to invest in our securities.
