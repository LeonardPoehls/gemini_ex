ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Overview 
 Bakken Resources, Inc. is an independent energy company focused on holding non-working interests in oil and natural gas properties in North America. Bakkens primary focus since inception in 2010 has been the Williston Basin in western North Dakota. The Company owns mineral rights to approximately 7,200 gross acres and 1,600 net mineral acres of land located about eight miles southeast of Williston, North Dakota. The Companys land assets consist generally of net mineral acres spanning from the sub-surface to the base of the so-called rock unit in an area commonly referred to as the Bakken formation.
 A non-working interest generally means that the Company does not bear either the risk or the financial burden attributable to exploration and production of oil and natural gas wells. The Company partners with strong operators to explore and develop oil and natural gas from company leases. The business model offers shareholders an opportunity to participate in the dynamic oil and natural gas industry without the high risk often present with exploration and production companies. The Company voluntarily provides the following table in order to provide an overview of third-party production in which the Company holds royalty interests, noting however, that such disclosures are not currently required for non-producing oil and gas companies such as BKKN.
 During 2016, the Company received royalty and overriding royalty payments on ninety-nine (99) producing oil wells, ninety-five (95) of which also produce natural gas. Production and proved reserves are as follows:
 
 | ProducingWells | AverageDailyProduction | ProvedReserves | PercentProvedDeveloped | 2016AveragePrice
------------+----------------+------------------------+-----------------+------------------------+-----------------
Oil | 99 | 14,526 Bbls | 48,322,403 Bbls | 28% | 39.06 
Natural Gas | 95 | 19,796 MCF | 73,377,156 MCF | 22% | 2.29 

 Bbls = Barrels MCF = thousand cubic feet 
 Leases comprising the Companys mineral rights provide an average 17% lease interest in production-based revenue before accounting for overriding royalties held by third parties. We acquired our mineral rights from a related Nevada company named Holms Energy LLC. (Holms Energy), which retained a 5% overriding royalty that will remain until November of 2020. Holms Energys overriding royalty is set to expire in November of 2020. Therefore, we expect to hold our current average 12% royalty (viz. 17% less 5%) from the oil and gas produced until November 2020. Upon expiration of Holms Energys overriding royalty, the 5% will revert back to the Company.
 The Companys effective net royalty interest is derived from three figures: (1) stated lease percentage, (2) net mineral acres, and (3) spacing unit. The lease rate multiplied by the net mineral acres, divided by the spacing unit, yields the net royalty interest for each well. The average effective net royalty interest in 2016 was 0.70%. For illustrative purposes, for every $100 in oil and gas production value, the Company receives $0.70 in net royalty revenue.
 We currently have leases with four contracted oil drilling operators (collectively, the Lessees) on various parcels of land on which we have mineral rights royalty interests: (1) Oasis Petroleum, (2) Continental Resources, Inc., (3) Statoil ASA, and (4) Samson Oil and Gas. We have no rights to influence our Lessees activities, but if the Lessees do not accomplish the agreed upon drilling programs within the timeline, Lessees can lose their leases. 
 Background
 The predecessor to our company was incorporated on June 6, 2008, under the laws of the State of Nevada, under the name Multisys Language Solutions, Inc. (MLS). Holms Energy contributed the primary assets that formed the basis of our current business operations. In connection with the closing of the transactions resulting in the contribution of the mineral rights held by Holms Energy in November 2010, Holms Energy received forty million (40,000,000) shares of common stock of the Company. Holms Energy retained a 5% overriding royalty until November 2020 on all gross revenue generated from the Company's gas and oil production royalty revenues. The mineral rights from Holms Energy transferred the Company only those rights from the surface to the base of the Bakken Formation. 
 Also in connection with the November 2010 transactions, the Company purchased approximately 800 net mineral acres from the Revocable Living Trust of Rocky G. Greenfield and Evenette G. Greenfield. These mineral rights included all mineral rights from the surface to the basement. The Company sold these 800 net mineral acres to a third party in February of 2014 and retained a two percent (2%) overriding royalty on the sale of the mineral rights.

Description of Oil Leases
 BRI currently derives its primary source of revenue from royalties generated from leasing mineral acreage. BRIs mineral acreage consists of approximately 1,600 net mineral acres located primarily in McKenzie County, North Dakota. Such 1,600 net mineral acres are currently spread across 18 spacing units. Operators covering BRIs minerals have been approved for up to 15 wells per spacing unit (typically 1,280 acres per spacing unit), but generally petition for permits prior to the commencement of drilling in a particular spacing unit. If this holds for all spacing units under which BRI has mineral acres, BRI would have a royalty interest in up to 187 wells. Note, however, that the royalties due to BRI under any particular well vary based on the number of acres BRI has under any particular spacing unit with a producing well.
Description of Oil Production Relevant to the Company
 With respect to drilling operations, pursuant to the North Dakota Oil and Gas Commission, long lateral deep horizontal multi-stage fracking wells in the Bakken Formation must be permitted in spacing unit of not less than 640 acres, up to 2,900 acres, with some exceptions. The spacing units have to be approved and permitted in advance of drilling by the North Dakota Oil and Gas Commission. The North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC) has approved multi-well permits for wells drilled in the Three Forks Formation along several of the defined benches typically associated with separate geologic benchmarks contained in the Three Forks Formation. Since approximately one-third of the Companys current net mineral acres include acreage in the Three Forks Formation, any increase in the drilling operations on the Companys net mineral acres which are permitted for Three Forks wells may result an increased number of total wells from which the Company may derive royalty income.
 When operators drill a horizontal well in the area where the subject property is located, they typically drill down about 10,800 vertical feet and then utilize a down-hole directional drilling tool to flatten the hole to 90 degrees and drill horizontally to the oil and gas producing formation. Horizontal directional drilling provides more contact area to the oil bearing formation than a typical vertical well. This method of drilling together with fracking is referred to as an enhanced oil recovery method, and is the primary source of recovery from the Bakken.
 The Company maintains a table on its website with information about wells in which it has mineral interests. That table is available at http://www.BakkenResourcesInc.com/Well-Activity/.
 The information provided in our websites table is categorized by well name, operator, field and pool, the NDIC identification number, and the well status and location description. Well status is defined by several categories, including: Producing, Confidential, Drilling, and Permitted Location to Drill. The table is updated as new information becomes available on the NDIC website at https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/. Included on the table are NDIC file numbers, which can be used when searching for information for each well listed on the BRI webpage. Individuals may subscribe to the NDIC website following the prompts on the homepage. A premium service subscription is also available for a fee.
 Currently, most of the leases covering the Companys mineral acres contain what is commonly referred to as continuous drilling clauses. Generally, a continuous drilling clause requires an operator to maintain active drilling operations in order to hold or extend an oil and gas lease past its natural expiration date. All the Companys current leases have active drilling operations and are likely to have active operations in the foreseeable future.
 2016 Highlights
 
● | The Companys oil and natural gas production volumes increased 47% and 97% respectively in 2016. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | After crude oil and natural gas prices decreased early in 2016 to roughly $21 per barrel and less than $2.00 per MBtu, respectively, both prices nearly doubled by year end. Even with these changes, however, neither crude oil nor natural gas exhibited drastic price volatility throughout 2016. See https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/prices.cfm.
● | The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices has also driven down mineral asset prices. The Company has been engaged in substantial efforts to identify and secure long-term producing assets including securing external capital to fund acquisitions. 
● | The Company had more than twenty new producing wells at year end. 
● | In 2014, the Company began an investigation into certain activities of our then-CEO, Val M. Holms. The Companys operating results continue to be undermined by the costs of the internal investigation and tangential litigation. The Company has filed a claim against the Val Holms estate to recoup these costs. 
● | The Company continues to defend against various litigation and has made progress toward ultimate resolution of such litigation. 
● | The Company has filed claims in 2016 seeking millions of dollars in damages from those who have caused the Company harm.

Our long-term plan is to grow the Company through mineral asset acquisition and build a diversified portfolio of royalty and overriding royalty mineral assets. Our asset base consists of shale based oil and natural gas wells. Shale based oil and natural gas wells realize sharp production declines after initial production. The average oil and natural gas well production typically declines by 85% during its first three years of production. Within the first five years, more than 90% of the wells lifetime production will have occurred. As well production decreases so does Company revenue and cash flow. Therefore, the Companys revenue and cash flow growth is heavily dependent on acquiring new well production from new assets or growth within existing assets. While we have existing capacity within our current Bakken assets, the Company is not sufficiently diversified to minimize risk. Our long-term goals are to expand revenue and cash flow while diversifying our portfolio of producing assets.
 We focus on royalties and overriding royalties. These particular asset categories offer risk and return characteristics that are consistent with our initial disclosure to the shareholders and our skill set. We are actively seeking to build a portfolio of royalty and overriding royalty assets that offer differing production cycles, geographic dispersion, and drilling methods. In addition to the capital we have acquired through the sale of the Greenfield assets, the Company continues to seek additional external capital to support our asset acquisition initiative. In this regard, the Company announced the closing of a $1 million credit line in May 2016 with additional best efforts to secure $10 million in additional financing.
 Pursuant to our business plan and strategy, we have sought out relationships to gather information on future potential oil and gas drilling projects and explored and contemplated possible joint partnerships in other drilling programs. The Company remains in discussion with various groups for strategic partnerships and plans to announce the completion of such arrangements if and when they are consummated. 
 Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Production. 
 We are not directly subject to various rules, regulations, and limitations impacting the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry as whole, however, operators who operate on our properties may be impacted by such rules and regulations. While this may provide the Company with some insulation from compliance costs applicable to our operator-Lessees, we may still be indirectly impacted by operator regulations because our revenue stream depends on operators. 
 Oil and natural gas exploration, production and related operations, when developed, are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state, and local authorities and agencies. For example, the state of North Dakota and Montana requires permits for exploration drilling, operation of commercial wells, submission of several reports concerning operations of wells and imposes other requirements relating to the production of oil and natural gas. Such states may also have statutes and regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells, and the regulation of spacing, plugging, and abandonment of such wells.
 Failure to comply with any such rules and regulations by our operators can result in substantial penalties, which in turn, may impact the amount of royalty revenue we derive from our leased properties. Although we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, to the extent they apply to us, because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws. Significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 Environmental Matters
 The following environmental discussion may be applicable directly to our operators; however, we could be indirectly impacted, since environmental laws and regulations could significantly impact production of the wells on our properties. Our operators and properties are impacted by extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation, and discharge of materials into the environment, and relating to safety and health, as such regulations relate to our operators. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation generally is toward stricter standards, and this trend will likely continue. These laws and regulations may:

● | require a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | limit or prohibit construction, drilling, or other activities on certain lands in the wilderness or other protected areas; or 
● | impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from its operations. 

 The permits required by our operators may be subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce their regulations, and violations are subject to fines or injunctions, or both. In the opinion of management, we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations, and have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements. Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or in interpretations thereof could have a significant impact on BRI, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general.

The Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and comparable state statutes impose strict, joint and several liabilities on owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites. It is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although CERCLA excludes petroleum from its definition of hazardous substance, state laws affecting our operators may impose clean-up liability relating to petroleum and petroleum related products. In addition, although RCRA classifies certain oil field wastes as non-hazardous, such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes thereby making such wastes subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements.
 Changes during 2016 in the federal administration may result in outcomes that decrease the Companys direct or indirect compliance costs. Certain indications have signaled a possible shift toward less stringent oversight of activity that impacts us or our operators. Even if such shifts take place, however, we anticipate that our operations will remain subject to CERCLA and other federal environmental regulations.
 Our operations are also subject to the Federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws. The Clean Water Act and similar state acts regulate other discharges of wastewater, oil, and other pollutants to surface water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, wetlands, and streams. Failure to obtain permits for such discharges could result in civil and criminal penalties, orders to cease such discharges, and costs to remediate and pay natural resources damages. Under the Clean Water Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has adopted regulations concerning discharges of storm water runoff. This program requires covered facilities to obtain individual permits, or seek coverage under a general permit. Some of our properties may require permits for discharges of storm water runoff and our operators may apply for storm water discharge permit coverage and updating storm water discharge management practices at some of our facilities. These laws also require the preparation and implementation of Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plans in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil.
 The Federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. The operations provided by our operators, may be, in certain circumstances and locations, subject to permits and restrictions under these statutes for emissions of air pollutants.
 The Endangered Species Act (ESA) seeks to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animal, fish and plant species, nor destroy or modify the critical habitat of such species. Under ESA, exploration and production operations, as well as actions by federal agencies, may not significantly impair or jeopardize the species or its habitat. ESA provides for criminal penalties for willful violations of the Act. Other statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and that may apply to our operations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. Although we believe that our operations will be in substantial compliance with such statutes, any change in these statutes or any reclassification of a species as endangered could subject BRI to significant expenses to modify our operations or could force BRI to discontinue certain operations altogether.
 Competition
 The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with numerous other oil and gas exploration and production companies who may also be seeking oil well operators for leasehold interests. Many of these companies have substantially greater resources than we have. Not only do they explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but many also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national, or worldwide basis. The operations of other companies may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties. They may also have more resources to define, evaluate, bid for, and purchase more properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit.
 Our larger or integrated competitors may have the resources to be better able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to federal, state, and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to determine reserves and acquire additional properties in the future will be dependent upon our ability and resources to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. In addition, we may be at a disadvantage in producing oil and natural gas properties and bidding for exploratory prospects, because we have fewer financial and human resources than many other companies in our industry. Should a larger and better financed company decide to directly compete with us, and be successful in its efforts, our business could be adversely affected.
 Marketing and Customers
 The market for oil and natural gas that we will produce depends on factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas, the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, demand for oil and natural gas, the marketing of competitive fuels and the effects of state and federal regulation. The oil and gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.

Our production royalties derived from oil and gas production from our properties are expected to be sold by the Lessees at prices tied to the spot oil markets. We derive certain royalty revenues from gas produced from wells drilled on our property, but currently this amount is small relative to the royalties we receive from oil production. We will be required to rely on the Lessees to market and sell any future gas production.
 Employees and Consultants
 We currently have one full-time employee, Karen Midtlyng, Secretary and Director. Dan Anderson, Chief Financial Officer, is an independent contractor. Our appointed executives have entered into written employments agreements. As drilling production activities continue to increase by our Lessees, and if additional revenue from production royalties develops as anticipated and continues to increase, we may hire additional technical, operational, or administrative personnel as appropriate. We are using and will continue to use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services. We believe that this use of third-party service providers may enhance our ability to contain general and administrative expenses.
Office Location
 Our offices are located at 825 Great Northern Boulevard, Expedition Block, Suite 304, Helena, MT 59601.
