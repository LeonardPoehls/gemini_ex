Lending Activities
 
Historically, our principal lending activities have been residential, consumer and commercial lending. As part of our growth strategy, we have been increasing our commercial portfolio and attracting larger, more comprehensive long-term borrowing relationships in the areas of commercial real estate lending (both owner and non-owner-occupied) and commercial lending, and supplementing these areas with more extensive cash management and depository services in an effort to increase interest income, diversify our loan portfolio and better serve the community.
 
The resulting overall loan portfolio performance has been strong with total loan growth of 7.8% in 2017, 7.9% in 2016, 10.4% in 2015 and 17.5% in 2014. Our total loans at December 31, 2017 increased by $199.3 million or 7.8% from December 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in our commercial loan portfolio which grew $123.3 million or 8.5% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017.
 
Our senior management team has carefully built the infrastructure necessary to support this growth and provide critical on-going portfolio management and risk assessment. A comprehensive risk management program is in place to enable us to evaluate the risk in our portfolio and to implement changes in our underwriting standards so as to minimize overall portfolio risk. As part of this program, our loan portfolio is subject to concentration limits, market analyses, stress testing, ongoing monitoring, and reporting and review of underwriting standards.

All of the credit facilities extended to the five largest borrowers as of December 31, 2017 are current and performing in accordance with their respective terms.
 
Real Estate Loans:
 
Residential Real Estate Loans: One of our primary lending activities consists of the origination of one-to-four family residential real estate loans that are primarily secured by properties located in Hartford County and surrounding counties in Connecticut. Of the $989.4 million and $907.9 million of residential loans outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, $413.3 million and $411.7 million are fixed-rate loans. Generally, residential real estate loans are originated in amounts up to 95.0% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property, with private mortgage insurance required on loans with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 80.0%. We usually do not make loans secured by single-family homes with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 95.0% (with the exception of Federal Housing Administration loans which allow for a 96.5% loan-to-value ratio). Fixed-rate mortgage loans generally are originated for terms of 7, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 years. All fixed-rate residential mortgage loans are underwritten pursuant to secondary market underwriting guidelines which include minimum FICO standards.
 
Based on the market environment for our residential mortgage originations we may sell our conforming 10, 15, 20 and 30 year fixed-rate residential mortgage loan production in the secondary market, while retaining the servicing rights. Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent mortgagors, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans. We originated $130.2 million of conforming fixed-rate one-to-four family residential loans for the year ended December 31, 2017, $115.0 million of which were sold in the secondary market and we originated $157.9 million of fixed-rate one-to-four family residential loans for the year ended December 31, 2016, $141.1 million of which were sold in the secondary market. The loans sold meet secondary market guidelines and are subject to warranty exposure. Such exposure is mitigated by our quality control procedures and the fact that we are selling newly originated loans instead of seasoned loans in the secondary market. As of December 31, 2017, we have not been requested or required to repurchase any sold loans due to inadequate underwriting or documentation deficiencies. We have not and do not intend to originate subprime or alternative A paper (alt A) loans.
 
We also offer adjustable-rate mortgage loans for one-to-four family properties, with an interest rate that adjusts annually based on the Wall Street Journal One-Year LIBOR, after a one, three, five, seven or ten - year initial fixed-rate period. Our adjustable rate mortgage loans generally provide for maximum rate adjustments of 500 basis points per adjustment, with a lifetime maximum adjustment up to 5.0%, regardless of the initial rate. Our adjustable rate mortgage loans amortize over terms of up to 30 years. We originated $42.6 million and $33.5 million adjustable rate one-to-four family residential loans for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we purchased $114.6 million and $117.7 million in adjustable rate mortgages through our correspondent network, respectively.
 
Adjustable rate mortgage loans decrease the risks associated with changes in market interest rates by periodically repricing, but involve other risks because as interest rates increase, the underlying payments by the borrower increase, thus increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustment of the contractual interest rate is also limited by the maximum periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustments permitted by our loan documents and, therefore, the effectiveness of adjustable rate mortgage loans may be limited during periods of rapidly rising interest rates. Of our one-to-four family residential real estate loans, $576.0 million and $496.2 million had adjustable rates of interest at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Declines in real estate values and or a slowdown in the housing market may make it more difficult for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to sell their homes or refinance their debt due to their declining collateral values.
 
All residential mortgage loans that we originate include “due-on-sale” clauses, which give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that, among other things, the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property. We also require homeowner’s insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance on properties securing real estate loans.

Our largest residential mortgage loan had a principal balance of $3.8 million at December 31, 2017, which is performing in accordance with terms.
 
Commercial Real Estate Loans: We originate commercial investment real estate loans and loans on owner-occupied properties used for a variety of business purposes, including office buildings, multi-family dwellings, industrial and warehouse facilities and retail facilities. Commercial mortgage loans totaled $1.1 billion and $979.4 million, or 38.8% and 38.5% of total loans, at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2017, our owner-occupied commercial mortgage loans constituted 25.6% of our commercial real estate portfolio and our investor-owned commercial mortgage real estate loans were 74.4% of the commercial real estate portfolio. The investor-owned portfolio is diversified among a number of property types as shown in the following table. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $272.3 million and $213.3 million, or 25.6% and 21.8%, at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our owner-occupied commercial real estate underwriting policies provide that typically such real estate loans may be made in amounts of up to 80.0% of the appraised value of the property. Our commercial real estate loans are generally made with terms of up to 20 years, amortization schedules generally up to 25 years and interest rates that are fixed for a period of time, generally set at a margin above the FHLBB Advance rates. Variable rate options are also available, generally tied to the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, or for qualifying borrowers, tied to LIBOR plus a margin. Interest rate swaps are offered to qualified borrowers to effect a fixed-rate equivalent for the borrower and allows us to effectively hedge against interest rate risk on large, long-term loans. In reaching a credit decision on whether to make a commercial real estate loan, we consider gross revenues and the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s cash flow and credit history, and the appraised value of the underlying property. In addition, with respect to commercial real estate rental properties, we also consider the terms and conditions of the leases, the credit quality of the tenants and the borrower’s global cash flow. We typically require that the properties securing our commercial real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization divided by interest expense and current maturities of long-term debt) of at least 1.20x. Environmental reports and current appraisals are required for commercial real estate loans as governed by our written environmental and appraisal policies. Generally, a commercial real estate loan made to a corporation, partnership or other business entity requires personal guarantees by the principals and owners of 20.0% or more of the entity, though, we do offer non-recourse financing to commercial real estate borrowers who exhibit strong credit metrics including, but not limited to, strong debt service coverage and low loan-to-value ratios.
 
A commercial real estate borrower’s financial information and various credit quality indicators are monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring the submission of periodic financial statement updates, annual tax returns and the periodic review of payment history. In addition, we typically conduct periodic face-to-face meetings with the borrower, as well as property site visits. These requirements also apply to guarantors of commercial real estate loans. Borrowers with loans secured by rental investment property are required to provide an annual report of income and expenses for such property, including a tenant rent roll and copies of leases, as applicable.
 
Loans secured by commercial real estate generally involve larger principal amounts and a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market, the economy or the tenant(s). Given our level of commercial real estate exposure, our commercial real estate portfolio risk management program enables us to evaluate the risk in our portfolio and to implement changes in our lending practices to minimize overall portfolio risk. As part of this program, the commercial real estate portfolio is subject to concentration limits, market analyses, stress testing, ongoing monitoring, and review and reporting of underwriting standards.
 
The largest commercial real estate loan, excluding commercial construction, was $21.5 million at December 31, 2017 and is performing in accordance with terms.

Construction Loans: We offer construction loans, including commercial construction loans and real estate subdivision development loans, to developers, licensed contractors and builders for the construction and development of commercial real estate projects and residential properties. Construction loans outstanding, including commercial and residential, totaled $90.1 million and $49.7 million, or 3.3% and 2.0% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2017, the unadvanced portion of these construction loans totaled $50.0 million, as compared to $57.1 million at December 31, 2016. Our underwriting policies provide that construction loans typically be made in amounts of up to 75.0% of the appraised value of the property. We extend loans to residential subdivision developers for the purpose of land acquisition, the development of infrastructure and the construction of homes. Advances are determined as a percentage of the cost or appraised value of the improvements, whichever is less, and each project is physically inspected prior to each advance either by a loan officer or an engineer approved by us. We typically limit the number of speculative units financed by a customer, with the majority of construction advances supported by purchase contracts.
 
We also originate construction loans to individuals and contractors for the construction and acquisition of personal residences. Residential construction loans outstanding totaled $10.2 million and $4.5 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The unadvanced portion of these construction loans totaled $7.6 million and $5.1 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our residential construction mortgage loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is typically up to nine months, although our policy is to consider construction periods as long as 12 months. At the end of the construction phase, the construction loan converts to a long-term owner-occupied residential mortgage loan. Construction loans can be made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80.0%. Before making a commitment to fund a residential construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. We also review and inspect each property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. Loan proceeds are disbursed after inspection based on the percentage of completion method. Construction loans to individuals are generally made on the same terms as our one-to-four family mortgage loans.
 
Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than longer-term financing on improved real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the actual cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost is too low, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Additionally, if the estimate of value is too high, we may be confronted with a project, when completed, with a value that is insufficient to assure full payment. Construction lending contains a unique risk characteristic as loans are originated under market and economic conditions that may change between the time of origination and the completion and subsequent purchaser financing of the property. In addition, construction subdivision loans and commercial and residential construction loans to contractors and developers entail additional risks as compared to single-family residential mortgage lending to owner-occupants. These loans typically involve large loan balances concentrated in single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. A continued economic downturn could have an additional adverse impact on the value of the properties securing construction loans and on our borrowers’ ability to sell their units for the amounts necessary to complete their projects and repay their loans.

The establishment of interest reserves for construction and development loans is an established banking practice, but the handling of such interest reserves varies widely within the industry. Many of our construction and development loans provide for the use of interest reserves, and based upon our knowledge of general industry practices, we believe that our practices related to such interest reserves are appropriate and adequate. When we underwrite construction and development loans, we consider the expected total project costs, including hard costs such as land, site work and construction costs and soft costs such as architectural and engineering fees, closing costs, leasing commissions and construction period interest. Based on the total project costs and other factors, we determine the required borrower cash equity contribution and the maximum amount we are willing to loan. In the vast majority of cases, we require that all of the borrower’s cash equity contribution be contributed prior to any material loan advances. This ensures that the borrower’s cash equity required to complete the project will in fact be available for such purposes. As a result of this practice, the borrower’s cash equity typically goes toward the purchase of the land and early stage hard costs and soft costs. This results in our funding the loan later as the project progresses, and accordingly we typically fund the majority of the construction period interest through loan advances. As of December 31, 2017, we are committed to advance construction period interest totaling approximately $1.6 million on construction and development loans. The maximum committed balance of all construction and development loans which provide for the use of interest reserves at December 31, 2017 was approximately $87.1 million, of which $50.4 million was outstanding at December 31, 2017 and $36.7 million remained to be advanced.
 
The largest commercial construction loan was $12.6 million of which $10.4 million was outstanding at December 31, 2017, and is performing in accordance with terms.
 
Commercial Loans:
 
Our approach to commercial lending is centered in relationship banking. While our primary focus is to extend financing to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers, we also endeavor to provide a comprehensive solution for all of a business’ banking needs including depository, cash management and investment needs. The commercial business loan portfolio is comprised of both middle market companies and small businesses located primarily in Connecticut and western Massachusetts. Market segments represented include manufacturers, distributors, service businesses, financial services, healthcare providers, not-for-profits, higher and secondary education institutions and professional service companies. Typically, our middle market lending group seeks relationships with companies that have borrowing needs in excess of $750,000, while our small business lending group supports companies with borrowing needs of $750,000 or less.
 
We had $429.1 million and $430.5 million in commercial loans at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Of the loans in our commercial loan portfolio, $15.2 million and $16.4 million were guaranteed by either the Small Business Administration, the Connecticut Development Authority or the United States Department of Agriculture at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total commercial business loans amounted to 15.6% and 16.9% of total loans at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Commercial business lending products generally include term loans, revolving lines of credit for working capital needs, equipment lines of credit to facilitate the purchase of equipment, and letters of credit. Commercial business loans are made with either adjustable or fixed-rates of interest. Variable rates are tied to either the prime rate, as published in The Wall Street Journal, or LIBOR, plus a margin. The interest rates of fixed-rate commercial business loans are typically set at a margin above the FHLBB Advance rates. Interest rate swaps are offered to qualified borrowers to effect a fixed-rate equivalent for the borrower and allows us to effectively hedge against interest rate risk on large, long-term loans.

When making commercial business loans, we consider the character and capabilities of the borrower’s management, our lending history with the borrower, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the historical and projected cash flows of the business, the strength of the borrower’s balance sheet, the value and composition of the collateral, and the financial strength and commitment of the guarantors, if any. Commercial loans are generally secured by a variety of collateral, including accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, and supported by personal guarantees. Depending on the collateral used to secure the loans, commercial business loans are typically advanced at a discount to the value of the loan’s collateral. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, unsecured commercial loans totaled $72.0 million and $69.3 million, respectively, or less than 3.0% of total loans outstanding. Generally, a commercial loan made to a corporation, partnership or other business entity requires personal guarantees by the principals and owners of 20.0% or more of the entity, though, we do offer non-recourse financing to commercial borrowers who exhibit strong credit metrics including but not limited to, strong debt service coverage and low loan-to-value ratios.
 
Commercial loans generally have greater credit risk than residential real estate loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which largely are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of a commercial business loan depends substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing the loan may depreciate over time, be difficult to appraise and or fluctuate in value. We seek to minimize these risks through our underwriting standards.
 
As of December 31, 2017, our largest commercial business loan relationship was fully advanced at $25.0 million, which was performing according to its terms. In addition to the commercial business loans discussed above, we had $3.9 million in letter of credit commitments as of December 31, 2017.
 
In an effort to both attract more sophisticated borrowers, as well as to hedge our interest rate risk associated with long-term commercial loans, we offer interest rate swaps via our correspondent banking partners. Interest rate swaps are primarily used to exchange a floating rate payment stream into a fixed-rate payment stream. The variable rates on swaps will change as market interest rates change. We will enter into swap transactions solely to limit our interest rate risk and effectively “fix” the rate for appropriate customer borrowings. We do not engage in any speculative swap transactions. Generally, swap options are offered to “pass” rated borrowers requesting long-term commercial loans or commercial mortgages in amounts of at least $1.0 million. We have established a derivative policy which sets forth the parameters for such transactions (including underwriting guidelines, rate setting process, maximum maturity, approval and documentation requirements), as well as identifying internal controls for the management of risks related to these hedging activities (such as approval of counterparties, limits on counterparty credit risk, maximum loan amounts, and limits to single dealer counterparties). Our interest rate swap derivatives are primarily collateralized by cash. As of December 31, 2017, we have 81 mirrored swap transactions with a total current notional amount of $411.7 million. The fair value of the interest rate swap derivative asset and liability is $10.3 million and $10.4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017.
 
Our small business customers typically generate annual revenues from their businesses of up to $2.5 million and have borrowing needs of up to $750,000. We deliver and promote the delivery of small business loan products to our existing and prospective customer base by leveraging our retail branch network, including our branch managers, supplemented by a team of dedicated business development officers. Our branch managers and business development officers are fully trained to assist small business owners through the entire loan process from application to closing. We offer a streamlined process for our customers by utilizing a credit scoring system as a key part of our underwriting process, along with a standardized loan documentation package. This results in our ability to deliver quick decision-making along with cost effective loan closings to our small business customers. As a designated Small Business Administration (“SBA”) preferred lender, we are also able to offer flexible financing terms to those borrowers who otherwise would not qualify under our traditional underwriting standards. The Small Business Administration program is a cornerstone of our small business loan program. Based on the SBA 2017 fiscal year, we were ranked 4th out of 71 small business lenders in CT as measured by number of loans, originating 48 loans totaling $3.2 million. Based on the SBA 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013 fiscal years, we were ranked 4th, 1st, 2nd and 3rd respectively, out of over 50 small business lenders in CT as measured by number of loans. We also were awarded the “Top Lender to Women Entrepreneurs” award for fiscal year 2015. As of December 31, 2017, our entire small business loan portfolio totaled $94.5 million or 3.4% of total loans, with an additional $4.5 million in unfunded loan commitments and an average loan size of approximately $97,000.

Home Equity Line of Credit:
 
We also offer home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, both of which are secured by owner-occupied one-to-four family residences. Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit totaled $165.1 million and $170.8 million, or 6.0% and 6.7% of total loans at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2017, the unadvanced amount of home equity lines of credit totaled $205.4 million, as compared to $199.2 million at December 31, 2016.
 
The underwriting standards utilized for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit include a determination of the borrower’s credit history, an assessment of the borrower’s ability to meet existing obligations and future payments on the proposed loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan. Home equity loans are offered with fixed-rates of interest and with terms of up to 15 years. The loan-to-value ratio for our home equity loans and our lines of credit, including any first mortgage, is generally limited to no more than 80.0%. Our home equity lines of credit have a ten-year draw period which amortizes over a 20-year period and adjustable rates of interest which are indexed to the prime rate, as reported in The Wall Street Journal.
 
Interest rates on home equity lines of credit are generally limited to a maximum rate of 18.0% per annum.
 
Other: Includes installment, collateral, demand, revolving credit and resort loans to customers with acceptable credit ratings residing primarily in our market area. Installment and collateral consumer loans generally consist of loans on new and used automobiles, loans collateralized by deposit accounts, and unsecured personal loans. The overall health of the economy, including unemployment rates and housing prices, may have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. The resort portfolio consists of a direct receivable loan outside the Northeast which is amortizing to its contractual obligations.  The Bank has exited the resort financing market with a residual portfolio remaining. Other loans totaled $5.7 million and $5.3 million, or 0.2% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. While the asset quality of these portfolios is currently strong, there is increased risk associated with consumer loans during economic downturns as increased unemployment and inflationary costs may make it more difficult for some borrowers to repay their loans.
Origination, Purchasing and Servicing of Loans:
 
In order to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates, we sell fixed-rate conforming loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing for the majority of these loans. Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent mortgagors, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans.
 
We are an approved seller and servicer of the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal Home Loan Bank. All adjustable rate mortgages are currently being held in our residential portfolio. We also originate Federal Housing Administration loans through our “Direct Endorsed” designation with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs.
 
We were servicing residential real estate loans sold in the amount of $598.4 million and $540.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We anticipate our servicing assets will continue to grow as we expect to sell a portion of our fixed-rate conforming loan production into the secondary market.
 
We also purchase one-to-four family residential mortgage loans throughout the New England and New York/New Jersey markets, from approved Correspondents licensed with the respective State Departments of Banking. The approved Correspondents are not employed by us and sell their loans based on competitive pricing. The loans are underwritten to meet or exceed Secondary Market requirements. We do not, however, participate in the purchase of credit impaired loans. We expect to continue to purchase one-to-four family residential mortgage loans from approved Correspondents so long as pricing and purchase opportunities remain favorable.
 
From time to time we enter into participations with other regional lenders in commercial real estate and commercial business loan transactions. We participate in transactions (purchase a share of the loan commitment), as well as sell portions of transactions that we originate. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our loan portfolio included $161.9 million and $139.4 million, respectively, in loans in which we purchased a participation share, and $155.7 million and $153.2 million, respectively, in loans participated to other institutions.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority:
 
Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory and regulatory compliant underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our board of directors and documented in our loan policy. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan, and the adequacy of the value of the collateral that will secure the loan, if applicable. To assess a business borrower’s ability to repay, we review and analyze, among other factors: the borrower’s historical, current, and projected financial performance; the borrower’s balance sheet and balance sheet trends; its capitalization; its ability to repay the proposed loan(s); the value and complexion of the assets offered as collateral; the ability of management to lead the borrower through the current and future economic cycles; and the financial strength and commitment of the personal or corporate guarantors, if any. To assess an individual borrower’s ability to repay, we review their employment and credit history and information on their historical and projected income and expenses, as well as the adequacy of the collateral.
 
Our policies and loan approval limits are established by our board of directors. Our board has delegated its authority to grant loans in varying amounts to the board of directors’ loan committee, which is currently comprised of all board members. The board loan committee is charged with general oversight of our credit extension functions and has designated the responsibility for the approval of loans, depending on risk rating and size (generally $7.5 million and under) to our management loan committee. In general, loan requests above $7.5 million are required to be approved by the board’s loan committee. Our management loan committee, in turn, has the right to delegate approval authority with respect to such loans to individual lenders as deemed appropriate.
 
Review of Credit Quality:
 
At the time of loan origination, a risk rating based on a nine point grading system is assigned to each commercial-related loan based on the loan officer’s and management’s assessment of the risk associated with each particular loan. This risk assessment is based on an in depth analysis of a variety of factors. More complex loans and larger commitments require that our internal Credit Risk Management Department further evaluate the risk rating of the individual loan or relationship, with our Credit Risk Management Department having final determination of the appropriate risk rating. These more complex loans and relationships receive ongoing periodic review to assess the appropriate risk rating on a post-closing basis with changes made to the risk rating as the borrower’s and economic conditions warrant. Our risk rating system is designed to be a dynamic system and we grade loans on a “real time” basis. Considerable emphasis is placed on risk rating accuracy, risk rating justification, and risk rating triggers. Our risk rating process is enhanced with the utilization of industry-based risk rating “cards.” The cards are utilized to promote risk rating accuracy and consistency on an institution-wide basis. Most loans are reviewed annually as part of a comprehensive portfolio review conducted by management and/or by our independent loan review firm. More frequent reviews of loans rated special mention, substandard and doubtful are conducted by our Credit Risk Management Department. We utilize an independent loan review consulting firm to affirm our rating accuracy and opine on the overall credit quality of our loan portfolio. The consulting firm conducts two loan reviews per year aiming at a 60.0% or higher commercial portfolio penetration. Summary findings of all loan reviews performed by the outside consulting firm are reported to our board of directors and senior management upon completion.

Our board of directors and senior management receive reporting throughout the year on credit trends in the commercial, residential and consumer portfolios (delinquencies, non-performing loans, risk rating migration, charge-off requests, etc.), as well as an update on any significant or developing troubled assets. We use risk management “dashboards” to assist in our ongoing portfolio monitoring and credit risk management reporting. The dashboards provide detailed analysis of portfolio and industry concentrations, as well as a variety of asset quality trends within industry and loan product types, and are presented to the board of directors on a monthly basis. This reporting system also performs various credit administration tracking functions, credit grade migration analysis and allows for an enhanced level of stress testing of the portfolios utilizing multiple variables.
 
In addition to the dashboards, on a periodic basis our board of directors and senior management receive reports on various “highly monitored” industries and portfolios, such as investment commercial real estate, “for-sale” real estate (i.e. subdivision and condominium lending) and home equity loans.
 
This comprehensive portfolio monitoring process is supplemented with several risk assessment tools including monitoring of delinquency levels, analysis of historical loss experience by loan portfolio segment, identification of portfolio concentrations by borrower and industry, and a review of economic conditions that might impact loan quality.
 
Non-performing and Problem Assets:
 
Our senior management places considerable emphasis on the early identification of problem assets, problem resolution and minimizing loss exposure. A loan is considered delinquent when the customer does not make their payments according to their contractual terms. Delinquencies are monitored daily and delinquency notices are mailed monthly to borrowers who have exceeded their payment grace period. In general, if a borrower fails to bring a loan current within 120 days from the original due date the matter may be referred to legal counsel and foreclosure or other collection proceedings may be initiated. We may consider a loan modification, forbearance or other loan restructuring in certain circumstances where a temporary loss of income is the primary cause of the delinquency, and if a reasonable plan is presented by the borrower. Commercial delinquencies are handled on a case by case basis, typically by our Special Assets Department. Appropriate problem resolution and working strategies are formulated based on the specific facts and circumstances.
 
Loans are placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days or more delinquent. In certain cases, if a loan is less than 90 days delinquent but the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, such loan may be placed on non-accrual status if we determine that collection of the loan in full is not probable. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is reversed and cash payments received are applied as a reduction to the loan principal. 
 
Loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due (including arrearages) are reasonably assured of repayment within a reasonable period and there is a sustained period of repayment performance (generally a minimum of six months) by the borrower, in accordance with contractual terms involving payment of cash or cash equivalents. The interest on these loans is not recognized, until qualifying for return to accrual status. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual status. If a residential real estate, commercial real estate, construction, installment, commercial, collateral, home equity line of credit, demand or revolving credit loan is on non-accrual status or is considered to be impaired, cash payments are applied first as a reduction of principal.
 
Classified Assets: Under our internal risk rating system, we currently classify loans and other assets considered to be of lesser quality as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” assets. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by either the current net worth or the paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as “loss” are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. In addition to the classifications discussed above, consistent with ASC 310-10-35, assets are classified as impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement.

The loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether any loans require risk classification or reclassification. Not all classified assets constitute non-performing assets. For example, at December 31, 2017, 89% of commercial real estate, construction real estate, commercial business and resort loans rated substandard were on accrual status and current as to payments. Our classified assets include loans identified as “substandard”, “doubtful” or “loss”. Substandard assets consisted of $39.7 million and $37.7 million of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We had no assets classified as “doubtful” or “loss” at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
 
On a quarterly basis, our loan policy requires that we evaluate for impairment all commercial loans classified as non-accrual, and residential and consumer non-accruing loans greater than $100,000 and troubled debt restructurings. We have determined that $30.2 million and $34.3 million of impaired loans existed at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Based upon our analysis, $1.2 million and $4.9 million of impaired loans required an allowance of $174,000 and $278,000 to be established as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, $36.9 million and $22.0 million, respectively, were included on the classified loan list and were not considered impaired.

Non-performing Assets: The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our non-performing assets at the dates indicated. Once a loan is 90 days delinquent or either the borrower or the loan collateral experiences an event that makes full collectability of the loan improbable, the loan is placed on “non-accrual” status. Our policy requires at least six months of continuous payments in order for the loan to be removed from non-accrual status.

Troubled debt restructurings: The following table presents information on loans whose terms had been modified in a troubled debt restructuring:
 

 | At December 31, | 
-----------------------------------------+------------------------+-------
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | | 2015 | | 2014 | 2013 | 
 | (Dollars in thousands) | 
Restructured loans on accrual status | $ | 6,172 | | $ | 8,160 | | $ | 16,952 | $ | 18,664 | $ | 15,790
Restructured loans on non-accrual status | | 9,484 | | | 10,090 | | | 7,258 | | 7,581 | | 7,578 
Total restructured loans | $ | 15,656 | | $ | 18,250 | | $ | 24,210 | $ | 26,245 | $ | 23,368

 
A loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) when we, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties, grant a concession to the borrower in modifying or renewing the loan that we would not otherwise consider. In connection with troubled debt restructurings, terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with their current financial status, which may include a reduction in the interest rate to market rate or below, a change in the term or amortization, or other modifications to the structure of the loan. A loan is placed on non-accrual status upon being restructured, even if it was not previously, unless the modified loan was current for the six months prior to its modification and we believe the loan is fully collectable in accordance with its new terms. Our policy to restore a restructured loan to performing status is dependent on the receipt of regular payments, generally for a period of six months and one calendar year-end. All troubled debt restructurings are classified as impaired loans and are reviewed for impairment by management on a quarterly basis and at calendar year-end reporting period per our policy.
 
At December 31, 2017, 100% of the accruing TDRs were performing in accordance with the restructured terms. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the allowance for loan losses included specific reserves of $172,000 and $160,000 related to TDRs, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Bank had charge-offs totaling $83,000 and $272,000, respectively, related to portions of TDRs deemed to be uncollectible. The Bank may provide additional funds to borrowers in TDR status. The amount of additional funds available to borrowers in TDR status was $107,000 and $369,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Potential Problem Loans: We perform a comprehensive internal analysis of our loan portfolio in order to identify and quantify loans with higher than normal risk. Loans having a higher risk profile are assigned a risk rating corresponding to the level of weakness identified in the loan. All special mention, substandard and doubtful loans are included on our “Watched Asset” report which is updated and reviewed quarterly by our Credit Risk Management Department. In addition, on a quarterly basis, loans rated special mention, substandard or doubtful are formally presented to and reviewed by management to assess the level of risk, ensure the risk ratings are appropriate, and ensure appropriate actions are being taken to minimize potential loss exposure. The review cycle is determined based on the risk rating and level of overall credit exposure. This quarterly review is performed by the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Lending Officer and members of the Credit Risk Management and Special Assets Departments. Loans identified as being “loss” are normally fully charged off. Loans risk rated substandard or more severe are generally transferred to the Special Assets Department, although it is not uncommon for commercial lenders to manage stable or improving substandard loans with significant oversight from the Special Assets Department. We do not use interest reserves to keep problem loans current. Interest reserves are only used for construction loans during the construction phase of the loan.
Allowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the statement of condition date. The allowance for loan losses consists of a formula allowance following FASB ASC 450 – “Contingencies” and FASB ASC 310 – “Receivables”. The allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.
 
The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a quarterly basis by management. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. The allowance consists of general, allocated and unallocated components, as further described below. All reserves are available to cover any losses regardless of how they are allocated.
 
General component:
 
The general component of the allowance for loan losses is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors stratified by the following loan segments: residential real estate, commercial real estate, construction, commercial, home equity line of credit and other. Construction loans include classes for commercial investment real estate construction, commercial owner occupied construction, residential development, residential subdivision construction and residential owner occupied construction loans. Management uses a rolling average of historical losses based on a time frame appropriate to capture relevant loss data for each loan segment. This historical loss factor is adjusted for the following qualitative factors: levels/trends in delinquencies and nonaccrual loans; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards and other changes in lending policies, procedures and practices; experience/ability/depth of lending management and staff; and national and local economic trends and conditions. There were no material changes in the Company’s policies or methodology pertaining to the general component of the allowance for loan losses during the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
The qualitative factors are determined based on the various risk characteristics of each loan segment. Risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as follows:
 
Residential real estate – Residential real estate loans are generally originated in amounts up to 95.0% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property, with private mortgage insurance required on loans with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 80.0%. The Company does not grant subprime loans. All loans in this segment are collateralized by owner-occupied residential real estate and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower. All residential mortgage loans are underwritten pursuant to secondary market underwriting guidelines which include minimum FICO standards. The overall health of the economy, including unemployment rates and housing prices, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment.
 
Commercial real estate – Loans in this segment are primarily originated to finance income-producing properties throughout the northeastern states. The underlying cash flows generated by the properties may be adversely impacted by a downturn in the economy as evidenced by increased vacancy rates, which in turn, may have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. Management generally obtains rent rolls and other financial information, as appropriate on an annual basis and continually monitors the cash flows of these loans.
 
Construction loans – Loans in this segment include commercial construction loans, real estate subdivision development loans to developers, licensed contractors and builders for the construction and development of commercial real estate projects and residential properties. Construction lending contains a unique risk characteristic as loans are originated under market and economic conditions that may change between the time of origination and the completion and subsequent purchaser financing of the property. In addition, construction subdivision loans and commercial and residential construction loans to contractors and developers entail additional risks as compared to single-family residential mortgage lending to owner-occupants. These loans typically involve large loan balances concentrated in single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Real estate subdivision development loans to developers, licensed contractors and builders are generally speculative real estate development loans for which payment is derived from sale of the property. Credit risk may be affected by cost overruns, time to sell at an adequate price, and market conditions. Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than longer-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Residential construction credit quality may be impacted by the overall health of the economy, including unemployment rates and housing prices.

--

 
Commercial – Loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by assets of the business. Repayment is expected from the cash flows of the business. A weakened economy, and resultant decreased consumer spending, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment.
 
Home equity line of credit – Loans in this segment include home equity loans and lines of credit underwritten with a loan-to-value ratio generally limited to no more than 80%, including any first mortgage. Our home equity lines of credit have a 9 year 10 month draw period followed by a 20 year amortization period and adjustable rates of interest which are indexed to the prime rate. The overall health of the economy, including unemployment rates and housing prices, may have an effect on the credit quality in this segment.
 
Other – Includes installment, collateral, demand, revolving credit and resort loans to customers with acceptable credit ratings residing primarily in our market area. Installment and collateral consumer loans generally consist of loans on new and used automobiles, loans collateralized by deposit accounts, and unsecured personal loans. The overall health of the economy, including unemployment rates and housing prices, may have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. The resort portfolio consists of a direct receivable loan outside the Northeast which is amortizing to its contractual obligations.  The Bank has exited the resort financing market with a residual portfolio remaining.
 
Allocated component:
 
The allocated component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial real estate, construction and commercial loans by the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate; the fair value of the collateral, if applicable; or the observable market price for the loan. An allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The Company does not separately identify individual consumer and residential real estate loans for impairment disclosures, unless such loans are subject to a troubled debt restructuring agreement or they are nonaccrual loans with outstanding balances greater than $100,000.
 
A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial and construction loans by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Management updates the analysis quarterly. The assumptions used in appraisals are reviewed for appropriateness. Updated appraisals or valuations are obtained as needed or adjusted to reflect the estimated decline in the fair value based upon current market conditions for comparable properties.
 
The Company periodically may agree to modify the contractual terms of loans. When a loan is modified and a concession is made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR"). All TDRs are classified as impaired.
 
Unallocated component:
 
An unallocated component is maintained, when needed, to cover uncertainties that could affect management’s estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating allocated and general reserves in the portfolio. The Company’s Loan Policy allows management to utilize a high and low range of 0.0% to 5.0% of our total allowance for loan losses when establishing an unallocated allowance, when considered necessary. The unallocated allowance is used to provide for an unidentified loss that may exist in emerging problem loans that cannot be fully quantified or may be affected by conditions not fully understood as of the balance sheet date. There was no unallocated allowance at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Based on the quantitative and qualitative assessment of the loan portfolio segments and in thorough consideration of the characteristics, risk and credit quality indicators, a detailed review of classified, non-performing and impaired loans, management believes that the allowance for loan losses properly estimated the inherent probable credit loss that exists in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. This analysis process is both quantitative and qualitative as it requires management to make estimates that are susceptible to revisions as more information becomes available. Although we believe that we have established the allowance at levels to absorb probable losses, future additions may be necessary if economic or other conditions in the future differ from the current environment.

Net charge-offs to average loans outstanding | | 0.02 | % | | | 0.04 | % | | 0.05 | % | | 0.10 | % | | 0.03 | %

 
It is our general policy to charge-off or partially charge-off any loan when it becomes evident that its collectability is highly unlikely, or our internal loan rating dictates a charge-off, either full or partial.  We take a charge-off when it is determined that there is a confirmed loss. Our charge-off policy has remained consistent and has not undergone any material revisions.
 
In making a determination on whether collection of a loan is unlikely, a number of criteria are considered including, but not limited to: the borrower’s financial condition; the borrower’s historical, current, and pro-forma debt service ability; an updated collateral valuation and / or impairment test; and the borrower’s and /or guarantor’s willingness and demonstrated ability to continue to support the credit (inclusive of a global cash flow analysis, if warranted).
 
With respect to reserves, all impaired loans are reviewed to determine if a valuation should be established based on one of three measurement tests: (1) the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate; (2) the fair value of the collateral, if applicable; or (3) the observable market price for the loan.  If we determine that an impairment amount exists, we will establish a valuation allowance (i.e. specific reserve) for the loan.  A charge-off is promptly recorded when a current appraisal for a collateral dependent loan indicates a fair value in excess of its recorded investment and the excess is identified as uncollectable. Updated appraisals are obtained at least annually per guidelines stated in the Loan Policy and, if appropriate, adjusted to reflect the estimated decline in the fair value based upon current market conditions for comparable properties. We categorize our loan portfolio into separate loan portfolio segment with similar risk characteristics.  In estimating credit losses, we consider historical loss experience on each loan portfolio segment, adjusted for changes in trends, conditions, and other relevant factors that may affect repayment of the loans as of the evaluation date.  Any partial charge-offs on our non-performing or impaired loans cause a reduction in our coverage ratio for our allowance for loan losses and other credit loss statistics.

As of December 31, 2017, we had impaired loans of $29.1 million with no valuation or partial charge-offs recorded.  As described above, if a loan is determined to be impaired, we will evaluate the amount of reserves for such loans based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral, if applicable, or the observable market price for the loan.  If we determine that an impairment amount exists, we will establish a valuation allowance for the loan.  If no impairment amount exists based on these tests, then no allowance for loan loss is required on that loan.  If an impairment is shown to exist, we establish an allowance for loan loss for the amount that the recorded investment or book value, in the loan exceeds the measure of the impaired loan.  In general, any portion of the recorded investment in a collateral dependent loan in excess of the fair value can be identified as uncollectible and is, therefore, deemed a confirmed loss which is charged-off against our allowance for loan losses.
 
Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses: The following table sets forth the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan portfolio segment, the percentage of allowance in each category to total allowance, and the percentage of loans in each portfolio segment to total loans at the dates indicated. The allowance for loan losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories.

Investment Activities
 
Our Chief Financial Officer is responsible for implementing our investment policy. The investment policy is reviewed at least annually by management and our board of directors and any changes to the policy are subject to the approval of the board of directors. Authority to make investments under the approved investment policy guidelines is delegated by the board of directors to our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and limited purchasing by our Finance Officer. While general investment strategies are developed and authorized by our Chief Financial Officer, the execution of specific actions rests with both our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, who may act jointly or severally. The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for ensuring that the guidelines and requirements included in the investment policy are followed and that all securities are considered prudent for investment.
 
Our investment policy requires that all securities transactions be conducted in a safe and sound manner. Investment decisions must be based upon a thorough analysis of each security instrument to determine its credit quality and fit within our overall asset/liability management objectives, its effect on our risk-based capital and the overall prospects for yield and/or appreciation.
 
Our investment portfolio, excluding FHLBB stock, totaled $162.2 million and $136.6 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and consisted primarily of United States government securities, securities issued and guaranteed by Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSE’s) including debt and mortgage-backed securities, municipal and other bonds, mutual funds and equity securities, including preferred equity securities.
 
Our investment objectives are to provide and maintain liquidity and appropriate collateral requirements, to establish an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, to provide an alternate source of low-risk investments when demand for loans is weak and to generate a favorable return. Our board of directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of our investment policy, which is reviewed and approved at least annually. Our board of directors reviews the status of our investment portfolio on a semi-annual basis.
 
Investment Securities Portfolio: The following table sets forth the carrying values of our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolio at the dates indicated.

U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government Agency Obligations: At December 31, 2017 and 2016, our U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government agency obligations portfolio totaled $120.5 million and $109.7 million, respectively, of which $77.6 million and $93.7 million, respectively, were classified as available-for-sale. There were no structured notes or derivatives in the portfolio.
 
Government Sponsored Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities: We purchase mortgage-backed securities insured or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. We do not own any “private label” mortgage backed securities. We invest in mortgage-backed securities to achieve a positive interest rate spread with minimal administrative expense and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae.
 
Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities are created by the pooling of mortgages and the issuance of a security with an interest rate which is less than the interest rate on the underlying mortgages. These mortgage-backed securities typically represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multi-family mortgages, although we focus our investments on mortgage-backed securities backed by one-to-four family mortgages. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as us and guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors. Government sponsored residential mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees, mortgage servicing and credit enhancements. However, these mortgage-backed securities are usually more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize our borrowing obligations.
 
At December 31, 2017, the carrying value of Government sponsored residential mortgage-backed securities totaled $34.8 million or 1.1% of assets, and 1.2% of interest earning assets, $2.8 million of which were classified as available-for-sale and $32.0 million of which were classified as held-to-maturity, compared to the carrying value of mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2016 which totaled $20.6 million or 0.7% of assets, and 0.8% of interest earning assets, $3.6 million of which were classified as available-for-sale and $17.1 million of which were classified as held-to-maturity. The available-for-sale mortgage-backed securities portfolio had a book yield of 3.44% and 3.23% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the held-to-maturity mortgage-backed securities portfolio had a book yield of 2.50% at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The estimated fair value of our mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2017 was $34.8 million, which is $117,000 more than the amortized cost and at December 31, 2016 $20.6 million, which was $208,000 more than the amortized cost. Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual prepayments may differ from estimated prepayments over the life of the security, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments, thereby changing the net yield on such securities. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities. In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates.
 
Our investment portfolio contained no Government sponsored residential mortgage-backed securities collateralized by “subprime” loans for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Although we do not have a direct exposure to subprime related assets, the value and related income of our mortgage-backed securities are sensitive to changes in economic conditions, including delinquencies and/or defaults on the underlying mortgages. Continuing shifts in the market’s perception of credit quality on securities backed by residential mortgage loans may result in increased volatility of market price and periods of illiquidity that can have a negative impact upon the valuation of certain securities held by us.
 
Corporate Debt Securities: We had no corporate debt securities at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2016, the fair value of our corporate bond portfolio totaled $515,000 which was classified as available-for-sale. The corporate bond portfolio was fixed rate earning a book yield of 5.41% at December 31, 2016. Although corporate bonds may offer higher yields than U.S. Treasury or agency securities of comparable duration, corporate bonds also have a higher risk of default due to possible adverse changes in the credit-worthiness of the issuer. In order to mitigate this risk, our investment policy requires that corporate debt obligation purchases be rated “A” or better by a nationally recognized rating agency. A security that is subsequently downgraded below investment grade will require additional analysis of credit worthiness and a determination will be made to hold or dispose of the investment.
Marketable Equity Securities and Mutual Funds: We currently maintain a diversified equity securities and mutual funds portfolio. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of our marketable equity securities portfolio totaled $187,000 and $182,000, respectively. Our marketable equity securities represented less than one percent of total assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016 and were classified as available-for-sale. The mutual funds portfolio totaled $4.9 million and $3.8 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The industries represented by our common stock investments are diverse and include banking, insurance and financial services, integrated utilities and various industrial sectors. Our investment policy provides that the total equity portfolio cannot exceed 50% of the Tier I capital of Farmington Bank. Investments in equity securities and mutual funds involve risk as they are not insured or guaranteed investments and are affected by stock market fluctuations. Such investments are carried at their market value and can directly affect our net capital position.

Preferred Equity Securities: Our investments in preferred equity securities consist of 80,000 shares of Goldman Sachs preferred stock at December 31, 2017. The carrying value of our preferred equity securities totaled $1.8 million and $1.7 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Trust Preferred Debt Securities: We had no trust preferred debt securities at December 31, 2017 and 2016. During 2015, we sold our trust preferred debt securities for a gain of $1.5 million.
 
Portfolio Maturities and Yields: The composition and maturities of the investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized in the following tables. Maturities are based on the final contractual payment dates, and do not reflect the impact of prepayments or early redemptions that may occur. State agency and municipal obligations as well as common and preferred stock yields have not been adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis. Certain mortgage-backed securities have interest rates that are adjustable and will reprice annually within the various maturity ranges. These repricing schedules are not reflected in the table below.

Sources of Funds
 
General: Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. In addition to deposits, funds are derived from scheduled loan payments, loan prepayments, investment maturities, retained earnings and income on earning assets.
Deposits: A majority of our depositors are persons and businesses who work or reside in Hartford County, Connecticut and Hampden County, Massachusetts. We offer a selection of deposit instruments, including checking, savings, money market savings accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal (“NOW”) accounts and fixed-rate time deposits. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. The Company has established a relationship to participate in a reciprocal deposit program with other financial institutions as a service to our customers. This program provides enhanced FDIC insurance to participating customers. The Company also has established a relationship for brokered deposits. There were brokered deposits totaling $58.8 million and $43.2 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies, market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. To attract and retain deposits, we rely upon brand marketing, personalized customer service, long-standing relationships and competitive interest rates.
 
The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts that we offer allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and responding to changes in consumer demand. Based on historical experience, management believes our deposits are relatively stable. Expansion of the branch network, the commercial and government banking divisions, as well as deposit promotions and disintermediation from investment firms due to increasing uncertainty in the financial markets, has provided us with opportunities to attract new deposit relationships.
 
It is unclear whether the recent growth in deposits will reflect our historical, stable experience with deposit customers. The ability to attract and maintain money market accounts and time deposits, and the rates paid on these deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. At December 31, 2017, $540.9 million or 22.2% of our deposits were time deposits, of which $380.6 million will be maturing within one year or less. At December 31, 2016, $464.6 million or 21.0% of our deposits were time deposits, of which $327.9 million will be maturing within one year or less.
 
Our government banking group provides deposit services to municipalities throughout Connecticut. Through the efforts of our government banking group, we attracted significant municipal deposits through existing and newly formed relationships. Municipal deposits as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $437.1 million or 18.0% and $394.5 million or 17.8% of our total deposits outstanding, respectively. These deposits can be more volatile than other deposits but provide significant liquidity generally at a lower or similar cost to wholesale funds. We limit the related contingent funding risk by limiting the amount of municipal deposits that can be accepted.
 
The following table displays a summary of our deposits by account type as of the dates indicated:

The Company also had letters of credit of $79.5 million and 83.5 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, subject to collateral requirements of the FHLBB. Internal policies limit borrowings to 25.0% of total assets, or $763.8 million and $709.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
We have a Master Repurchase Agreement borrowing facility with a broker. Borrowings under the Master Repurchase Agreement are secured by our investments in certain securities and cash with a fair value totaling $11.2 million at December 31, 2017. Outstanding repurchase agreement borrowings totaled $10.5 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
 
The Company has access to pre-approved unsecured lines of credit with financial institutions totaling $58.5 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, which were undrawn at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Company maintains a cash balance of $512,500 with certain financial institutions to avoid fees associated with the lines.
 
Competition
 
We face competition within our market area both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our primary market area is central Connecticut and western Massachusetts which has a high concentration of financial institutions including large commercial banks, community banks, credit unions and mortgage companies. We opened one de novo branch in Vernon, CT and a loan production office in Fairfield, CT during 2016. We anticipate opening a de novo branch in Manchester, CT in the first quarter of 2018. Some of our competitors offer products and services that we currently do not offer, such as trust services and private banking.
 
Based on the most recent data available from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as of June 30, 2017, we possess a 5.99% deposit market share in Hartford County. Our market share rank is 4th out of 27 financial institutions.
 
Our competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies. Our primary focus is to build and develop profitable customer relationships across all lines of business while continuing to support the communities within our service area.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 
General
 
Farmington Bank, a Connecticut-chartered stock savings bank, is subject to extensive regulation by the Connecticut Department of Banking, as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC as its deposit insurer. Farmington Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund. Farmington Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the FDIC and the Connecticut Department of Banking concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions and opening or closing branch offices. FCB, as a bank holding company is subject to regulation by and required to file reports with the Connecticut Department of Banking, the Federal Reserve Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
The following discussion of other laws and regulations material to our operations contains a summary of the current material provisions of such laws and regulations applicable to our operations. Any change in such regulations, whether by the Connecticut Department of Banking, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or the Securities and Exchange Commission, could have a material adverse impact on us.
 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
 
On July 21, 2010, the President of the United States signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). This law significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies were given significant discretion in drafting the rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years. The current administration, led by President Donald Trump, has announced that it intends to slow down the adoption of new Dodd-Frank Act regulations and to consider proposing changes to the legislation. In addition, members of Congress have recently introduced legislation that would make significant changes to the Dodd-Frank Act, including changes that would increase the threshold for classifying financial institutions as “systemically important” (subjecting such institutions to greater regulatory oversight) from $50 billion to $250 billion. This legislation, if adopted, would also require the federal banking agencies to create a “community bank leverage ratio” of not less than 8% and not more than 10% for certain depository institutions and depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. The following summary assumes no changes to the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations adopted to date.

The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Farmington Bank, as a bank with $10 billion or less in assets, will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by our primary bank regulators. The current director of the CFPB, appointed by President Trump, recently introduced the CFPB’s new five-year strategic plan. The plan suggests the CFPB may shift to a less strident enforcement approach. In addition, certain members of Congress have introduced legislation that would, if adopted, either eliminate or significantly reduce the authority of the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakened the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorney generals the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act establishes numerous restrictions and requirements that mortgage lenders must follow or satisfy before making a residential mortgage loan, including the verification of a mortgage loan applicant’s ability to repay a mortgage loan. The Dodd-Frank Act’s mortgage reform provisions also allow borrowers to assert violations of certain provisions of the Truth-in-Lending Act as a defense to foreclosure proceedings.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act requires minimum leverage (Tier 1) and risk based capital levels for bank and savings and loan holding companies that are no less than those applicable to banks, which will exclude certain instruments that previously have been eligible for inclusion by bank holding companies as Tier 1 capital, such as trust preferred securities.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC deposit insurance assessments. Assessments are based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution, rather than deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. The legislation also increased the required minimum reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund, from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits, and directed the FDIC to offset the effects of increased assessments on depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. The FDIC has issued regulations to implement these provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. It has, in addition, established a higher reserve ratio of 2% as a long-term goal beyond what is required by statute. There is no implementation deadline for the 2% ratio.
 
Under the Dodd-Frank Act we are required to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments. The Dodd-Frank Act also authorized the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate rules that would allow certain stockholders to nominate candidates for election to the FCB board of directors using our proxy materials. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank and bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not.
 
The full scope and impact of the Dodd-Frank Act's provisions will continue to be determined over time as additional regulations are issued and examination practices are aligned with the new rules. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on First Connecticut Bancorp or Farmington Bank at this time, although it has increased our compliance and operating costs and may otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Nor can we predict the impact or substance of other future legislation or regulation.
 
Connecticut and FDIC Banking Laws and Supervision
 
Connecticut Banking Commissioner: The Connecticut Banking Commissioner regulates internal organization as well as the deposit, lending and investment activities of state chartered banks, including Farmington Bank. The approval of the Connecticut Banking Commissioner is required for, among other things, the establishment of branch offices and business combination transactions. The Commissioner conducts periodic examinations of Connecticut-chartered banks, as does the FDIC. The FDIC also regulates many of the areas regulated by the Connecticut Banking Commissioner, and federal law may limit some of the authority provided to Connecticut-chartered banks by Connecticut law.

--

Lending Activities: Connecticut banking laws grant banks broad lending authority. With certain limited exceptions, secured and unsecured loans of any one obligor under this statutory authority may not exceed 10.0% and 15.0%, respectively, of a bank’s equity capital and allowance for loan losses.
Dividends: Farmington Bank may pay cash dividends out of its net profits. Further, the total amount of all dividends declared by a bank in any year may not exceed the sum of a bank’s net profits for the year in question combined with its retained net profits from the preceding two years. Federal law also prevents an institution from paying dividends or making other capital distributions that, if by doing so, would cause it to become “undercapitalized.” The FDIC may limit a bank’s ability to pay dividends. No dividends may be paid to Farmington Bank’s sole stockholder, First Connecticut Bancorp, if such dividends would reduce stockholders’ equity below the amount of the liquidation account required by Connecticut regulations.
Powers: Connecticut law permits Connecticut banks to sell insurance and fixed and variable rate annuities if licensed to do so by the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner. With the prior approval of the Connecticut Banking Commissioner, Connecticut banks are also authorized to engage in a broad range of activities related to the business of banking, or that are financial in nature or that are permitted under the Bank Holding Company Act or the Home Owners’ Loan Act, both federal statutes, or the regulations promulgated as a result of these statutes. Connecticut banks are also authorized to engage in any activity permitted for a national bank or a federal savings association upon filing notice with the Connecticut Banking Commissioner unless the Banking Commissioner disapproves the activity.
Assessments: Connecticut banks are required to pay annual assessments to the Connecticut Banking Department to fund the Department’s operations. The general assessments are paid pro-rata based upon a bank’s asset size.
Enforcement: Under Connecticut law, the Connecticut Banking Commissioner has extensive enforcement authority over Connecticut banks and, under certain circumstances, affiliated parties, insiders, and agents. The Connecticut Banking Commissioner’s enforcement authority includes cease and desist orders, fines, receivership, conservatorship, removal of officers and directors, emergency closures, dissolution and liquidation.
Holding Company Regulation
 
General: As a bank holding company, FCB is subject to comprehensive regulation and regular examinations by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.
 
Federal Reserve Board policy historically has required a bank holding company to serve as a source of strength for its subsidiary bank. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Pursuant to this requirement, the Federal Reserve Board may require, and has required in the past, a holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank. As a bank holding company, FCB is required to obtain Federal Reserve Board approval before: (i) acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5.0% of such shares (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares); (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (iii) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. Under Connecticut banking law, no person may acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10.0% of any class of voting securities of a Connecticut-chartered bank, or any bank holding company of such a bank, without prior notification of, and lack of disapproval by, the Connecticut Banking Commissioner.
 
The Bank Holding Company Act also prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5.0% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non-bank activities which, by statute or by Federal Reserve Board regulation or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks. The list of activities permitted by the Federal Reserve Board includes, among other things: (i) operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; (ii) performing certain data processing operations; (iii) providing certain investment and financial advice; (iv) underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; (v) leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; (vi) selling money orders, travelers’ checks and United States savings bonds; (vii) real estate and personal property appraising; (viii) providing tax planning and preparation services; (ix) financing and investing in certain community development activities; and (x) subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers.

As a public company with securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, First Connecticut Bancorp also is subject to that statute and to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
 
Dividends: The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve Board’s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the holding company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company’s bank subsidiary is classified as “undercapitalized.”
 
Pursuant to Connecticut banking regulations, no dividend may be paid to stockholders if such dividends would reduce our stockholders’ equity below the amount of the liquidation account established in connection with the conversion of the company from mutual to stock form. Farmington Bank may pay cash dividends only out of its net profits. For purposes of this restriction, “net profits” represents the remainder of all earnings from current operations. Further, the total amount of all dividends declared by Farmington Bank to FCB in any year may not, without express permission of the Connecticut Banking Commissioner, exceed the sum of Farmington Bank’s retained net profits for the past two fiscal years and its net profits of the year in which the dividend is paid. In addition, FCB is subject to Maryland law limitations. Maryland law generally limits dividends to an amount equal to the excess of our capital surplus over payments that would be owed upon dissolution to stockholders whose preferential rights upon dissolution are superior to those receiving the dividend, and to an amount that would not make us insolvent.
 
Redemption: Bank holding companies are required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10.0% or more of the consolidated net worth of the bank holding company. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. This notification requirement does not apply to any company that meets the well capitalized standard for commercial banks, is “well managed” within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Board regulations and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues. However, in February 2009, the Federal Reserve Board issued SR 09-4 which, among other things, requires all bank holding companies to consult with the Federal Reserve board prior to redeeming stock without regard to the bank holding company’s capital status or regulations otherwise permitting redemptions without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.
Federal Regulations
 
Capital Requirements: Under FDIC regulations, federally insured state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System (“state non-member banks”), such as Farmington Bank, are required to comply with minimum leverage capital requirements. For an institution determined by the FDIC to not be anticipating or experiencing significant growth and to be, in general, a strong banking organization, rated composite 1 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Ranking System established by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, the minimum capital leverage requirement is a ratio of Tier I capital to total assets of 3.0%. For all other institutions, the minimum leverage capital ratio is 4.0%. Tier I capital is the sum of common stockholders’ equity, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (including any related surplus) and minority investments in certain subsidiaries, less intangible assets (except for certain servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships) and certain other specified items.
 
The FDIC regulations require state non-member banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital in relation to regulatory risk-weighted assets. The ratio of regulatory capital to regulatory risk-weighted assets is referred to as a bank’s “risk-based capital ratio.” Risk-based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet items (including recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes and residual interests) to four risk-weighted categories ranging from 0.0% to 100.0%, with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk. For example, under the FDIC’s risk-weighting system, cash and securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government are given a 0.0% risk weight, loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties generally have a 50.0% risk weight, and commercial loans have a risk weighting of 100.0%.
 

26
--

 

State non-member banks such as Farmington Bank must maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, of which at least half must be Tier I capital. Total capital consists of Tier I capital plus Tier 2 or supplementary capital items, which include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, cumulative preferred stock and certain other capital instruments, and a portion of the net unrealized gain on equity securities. The includable amount of Tier 2 capital cannot exceed the amount of the institution’s Tier I capital. Banks that engage in specified levels of trading activities are subject to adjustments in their risk based capital calculation to ensure the maintenance of sufficient capital to support market risk.
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act required each federal banking agency to revise its risk-based capital standards for insured institutions to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest-rate risk, concentration of credit risk, and the risk of nontraditional activities, as well as to reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi-family residential loans. The FDIC, along with the other federal banking agencies, has adopted a regulation providing that the agencies will take into account the exposure of a bank’s capital and economic value to changes in interest rate risk in assessing a bank’s capital adequacy. The FDIC also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon determination that an institution’s capital level is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of the particular circumstances.
 
In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board promulgated a final rule and the FDIC promulgated an interim final rule implementing Basel III, providing for a strengthened set of capital requirements. These requirements became effective on January 1, 2015 for us. In general, the rules revise regulatory capital definitions and minimum ratios, redefine Tier I capital, create a capital ratio (common equity Tier I risk-based capital ratio), require a capital conservation buffer, revise prompt corrective action thresholds to add a ratio to these thresholds (discussed in more detail below) and revise risk weighting for certain asset categories and off-balance sheet exposures. Under the regulations, (1) a requirement to maintain a ratio of common equity Tier I capital to total risk-based assets of not less than 4.5% will be implemented, (2) the minimum Leverage Capital Ratio for all financial institutions will be at least 4%, (3) the minimum Tier I Risk-Based Capital Ratio increases from 4% to 6% and (4) the Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio maintains at 8%. In addition, the regulations impose certain limitations on dividends, share buybacks, discretionary payments on Tier I instruments and discretionary bonuses to executive officers if the organization fails to maintain a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier I capital in an amount greater than 2.5% of its total risk-weighted assets. The end result of the capital conservation buffer will be to increase the minimum common equity Tier I capital ratio to 7%, the minimum Tier I Risk-Based Capital Ratio to 8.5% and the minimum Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio to 10.5% for financial institutions seeking to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The regulations will be phased in over a period of time. The capital conservation buffer will be phased-in over a five year period with the full 2.5% requirement starting as of January 1, 2019.
 
Additionally, under the regulations, the method for calculating the ratios has been revised to generally enhance risk sensitivity as well as provide alternatives to credit ratings for calculating risk-weighted assets. As of December 31, 2017, we currently comply with the BASEL III requirements on a fully phased-in basis.
 
As a bank holding company, FCB is subject to capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies similar to those of the FDIC for state-chartered banks.
 
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action: Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.
 
The FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. An institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 4.0% or greater, and generally a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, or generally a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of less than 3.0%, or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. As of December 31, 2017, Farmington Bank was a well-capitalized institution.

“Undercapitalized” banks must adhere to growth, capital distribution (including dividend) and other limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. A bank’s compliance with such a plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including but not limited to an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status.
 
Safety and Soundness Standards: The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”) requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to establish standards, by regulations or guidelines, designed to ensure the safety and soundness of insured financial institutions. The FDIA requires financial institutions to establish, among other things, internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, risk management policies and procedures, credit underwriting standards, and other operational and managerial standards designed to meet the FDIA’s requirements. The federal banking agencies may, but are not required, to order an institution that is not meeting applicable safety and soundness standards to submit a plan to bring the institution into compliance with such standards. If an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails to implement its compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency.
Transactions with Affiliates: Under current federal law, transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (the “FRA”). In a holding company context, at a minimum, the parent holding company of a savings bank and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the savings bank. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the savings bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to 10.0% of such savings bank’s capital stock and surplus, and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to 20.0% of capital stock and surplus. The term “covered transaction” includes, among other things, the making of loans or other extensions of credit to an affiliate and the purchase of assets from an affiliate. Section 23A also establishes specific collateral requirements for loans or extensions of credit to, or guarantees, acceptances on letters of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate. Section 23B requires that covered transactions and a broad list of other specified transactions be on terms substantially the same, or no less favorable, to the savings bank or its subsidiary as similar transactions with non-affiliates.
Loans to Insiders: Further, Section 22(h) of the FRA restricts an institution with respect to loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders (“insiders”). Under Section 22(h), loans to insiders and their related interests may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities, the institution’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Loans to insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the board of directors. Further, under Section 22(h), loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, except that such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the bank’s employees and does not give preference to the insider over the employees. Section 22(g) of the FRA places additional limitations on loans to executive officers.
Enforcement: The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured savings banks, including Farmington Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.
 
The FDIC has authority under Federal law to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured bank under limited circumstances. The FDIC is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if that bank was “critically undercapitalized” on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became “critically undercapitalized.” The FDIC may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non-member institution under specific circumstances on the basis of the institution’s financial condition or upon the occurrence of other events, including: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; and (4) insufficient capital, or the incurring of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance.

Insurance of Deposit Accounts: The FDIC has adopted a risk-based insurance assessment system. The FDIC assigns an institution to one of three capital categories based on the institution’s financial condition consisting of (1) well capitalized, (2) adequately capitalized or (3) undercapitalized, and one of three supervisory subcategories within each capital group. The supervisory subgroup to which an institution is assigned is based on a supervisory evaluation provided to the FDIC by the institution’s primary federal regulator and information which the FDIC determines to be relevant to the institution’s financial condition and the risk posed to the Deposit Insurance Fund. An institution’s assessment rate depends on the capital category and supervisory category to which it is assigned. Effective April 1, 2011, the FDIC revised its assessment schedule so that it ranges from 2.5 basis points for the least risky institutions to 45 basis points for the riskiest. The rule changed the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments from deposits to average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity capital. Since the new base is larger than the previous base, the FDIC also lowered assessment rates so that the rule would not significantly alter the total amount of revenue collected from the industry. FDIC members are also required to assist in the repayment of bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (FICO) in the late 1980’s to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.
 
The FDIC provides insurance up to $250,000 per depositor for each account ownership category. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Bank’s total FDIC assessments were $1.7 million, $1.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. In setting the assessments necessary to achieve the 1.35% ratio, the FDIC is supposed to offset the effect of the increased ratio on insured institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC. The FDIC has recently exercised that discretion by establishing a long range fund ratio of 2%.
 
The FDIC may terminate insurance of deposits if it finds that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violations that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.
 
Federal Reserve System: The Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain non-interest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts. We are in compliance with these requirements.
Federal Home Loan Bank System: Farmington Bank is a member of the FHLBB, which is one of the regional Federal Home Loan Banks composing the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions. Farmington Bank, as a member of the FHLBB, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLBB. While the required percentages of stock ownership are subject to change by the FHLBB, we were in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLBB stock of $15.5 million and $16.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The FHLBB paid dividends totaling $703,000, $701,000 and $522,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. There can be no assurance that the impact of recent or future legislation on the Federal Home Loan Banks also will not cause a decrease in the value of the FHLBB stock held by us.
Financial Modernization: The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act permits greater affiliation among banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and other companies under a new type of financial services company known as a “financial holding company.” A financial holding company essentially is a bank holding company with significantly expanded powers. Financial holding companies are authorized by statute to engage in a number of financial activities previously impermissible for bank holding companies, including securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; and merchant banking activities. The act also permits the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury Department to authorize additional activities for financial holding companies if they are “financial in nature” or “incidental” to financial activities. A bank holding company may become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized, well managed, and has at least a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating. A financial holding company must provide notice to the Federal Reserve Board within 30 days after commencing activities previously determined by statute or by the Federal Reserve Board and Department of the Treasury to be permissible. We are not currently a financial holding company and are not precluded from submitting a notice in the future should we wish to engage in activities only permitted to financial holding companies.

Miscellaneous Regulation
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002: The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), which implements a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures for public companies designed to promote honesty and transparency in corporate America and better protect investors from corporate wrongdoing. In general, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandated important new corporate governance and financial reporting requirements intended to enhance the accuracy and transparency of public companies’ reported financial results. It established new responsibilities for corporate chief executive officers, chief financial officers and audit committees in the financial reporting process, and it created a new regulatory body to oversee auditors of public companies. It backed these requirements with new Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement tools, increased criminal penalties for federal mail, wire and securities fraud, and created new criminal penalties for document and record destruction in connection with federal investigations. It also increased the opportunity for more private litigation by lengthening the statute of limitations for securities fraud claims and providing new federal corporate whistleblower protection.
 
Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act prohibits the extension of personal loans to directors and executive officers of issuers (as defined in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). The prohibition, however, does not apply to loans advanced by an insured depository institution, such as those that are subject to the insider lending restrictions of Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act.
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also required that the various securities exchanges, including The Nasdaq Global Select Market, prohibit the listing of the stock of an issuer unless that issuer complies with various requirements relating to their committees and the independence of their directors that serve on those committees.
 
Members of Congress have introduced legislation recently that would, if adopted, exclude some financial institutions from certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, such as by increasing the market capitalization thresholds that trigger the applicability of provisions related to the effectiveness of a public company’s internal controls.
 
Community Reinvestment Act: Under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), as implemented by FDIC regulations, a bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA does require the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires the FDIC to provide a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. Farmington Bank’s latest FDIC CRA rating was “satisfactory.”
 
Connecticut has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA which is also applicable to Farmington Bank. The Connecticut version is generally similar to the CRA but utilizes a five-tiered descriptive rating system. Connecticut law requires the Connecticut Banking Commissioner to consider, but not be limited to, a bank’s record of performance under Connecticut law in considering any application by the bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, to relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution. Farmington Bank’s most recent rating under Connecticut law was “satisfactory.”
 
Consumer Protection and Fair Lending Regulations: We are subject to a variety of federal and Connecticut statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees for certain types of violations.

The USA PATRIOT Act: On October 26, 2001, the USA PATRIOT Act (the “PATRIOT Act”) was enacted. The PATRIOT Act gives the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The PATRIOT Act also requires the federal banking regulators to take into consideration the effectiveness of controls designed to combat money-laundering activities in determining whether to approve a merger or other acquisition application of an FDIC-insured institution. As such, if FCB or Farmington Bank were to engage in a merger or other acquisition, the effectiveness of its anti-money-laundering controls would be considered as part of the application process. We have established policies, procedures and systems to comply with the applicable requirements of the law. Core provisions of the PATRIOT Act that had expired in 2015 were restored with the enactment of the USA Freedom Act in 2015.
 
Privacy Laws and Regulations: The federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act generally prohibits financial institutions, including Farmington Bank, from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information pertaining to consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes unless such customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of such disclosure and have not exercised this right. Connecticut law contains provisions that generally restrict the disclosure of customer financial records to third parties. The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes.
Federal Securities Laws: The common stock of FCB is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Federal and State Taxation
 
Federal Taxation
 
General: We are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us.
Method of Accounting: For Federal income tax purposes, we report income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and use tax year ending December 31 for filing federal income tax returns.
Bad Debt Reserves: Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”), Farmington Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at our taxable income. As a result of the 1996 Act, Farmington Bank was required to use the specific charge-off method in computing its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal tax return. Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve). At December 31, 2017, Farmington Bank had no reserves subject to recapture in excess of its base year.
Taxable Distributions and Recapture: Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created before January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if Farmington Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests. Federal legislation has eliminated these thrift-related recapture rules. At December 31, 2017, our total federal pre-1988 base year reserve was $3.4 million. However, under current law, pre-1988 base year reserves remain subject to recapture if Farmington Bank makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its stock, pays dividends in excess of tax earnings and profits, or ceases to maintain a bank charter.
Alternative Minimum Tax: The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), imposes an alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) at a rate of 20.0% on a base of regular taxable income adjusted by certain tax preferences which we refer to as “alternative minimum taxable income.” The AMT is payable to the extent such alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount and is in addition to the regular income tax. Net operating losses can generally offset no more than 90.0% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain AMT payments may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. We have not been subject to the AMT and have no such amounts available as credits for carryover.
 
The newly enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Any AMT credit carryovers to tax years after the effective date generally may be utilized to the extent of the taxpayer’s regular tax liability (as reduced by certain other credits). In addition, for tax years beginning in 2018, 2019 and 2020, to the extent AMT credit carryovers exceed regular tax liability (as reduced by certain other credits), 50% of the excess AMT credit carryovers are refundable (a proration rule with respect to short tax years). Any remaining AMT credits will be fully refundable in 2021.

Net Operating Loss Carryovers: A corporation may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At December 31, 2017, we had no net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes.
 
The Tax Act limits the net operating loss deduction to 80% of taxable income and disallows the carryback of net operating losses for tax years ended after December 31, 2017 but allows for the indefinite carryforward of those net operating losses.
 
Charitable Contribution Carryforward: As part of the Plan of Conversion and Reorganization completed on June 29, 2011, the Company contributed shares of Company common stock to the Farmington Bank Community Foundation, Inc. This contribution resulted in a charitable contribution deduction for federal income tax purposes. Use of that charitable contribution deduction is limited under Federal tax law to 10% of federal taxable income without regard to charitable contributions, net operating losses, and dividend received deductions. Annually, a corporation is permitted to carry over to the five succeeding tax years, contributions that exceeded the 10% limitation, but also subject to the maximum annual limitation. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the valuation allowance established in 2015 of $771,000 was reversed and the related deferred tax asset totaling $137,000 was written-off.
Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction: FCB may exclude from its income 100.0% of dividends received from Farmington Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends received deduction is 80.0% in the case of dividends received from corporations with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return, and corporations which own less than 20.0% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct only 70.0% of dividends received or accrued on their behalf.
 
The Tax Act lowers the 80% dividends received deduction (for dividends from 20% owned corporations) to 65% and the 70% dividends received deduction (for dividends from less than 20% owned corporations) to 50%, effective for tax years beginning after 2017.
 
State Taxation
 
Connecticut
 
We are subject to the Connecticut corporation business tax. The Connecticut corporation business tax is based on the federal taxable income before net operating loss and special deductions and makes certain modifications to federal taxable income to arrive at Connecticut taxable income. Connecticut taxable income is multiplied by the state tax rate (7.5% for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2017 and 2016) (plus an additional 20% surtax applies for tax years 2017 and 2016) to arrive at Connecticut income tax.
 
In 1998, the State of Connecticut enacted legislation permitting the formation of passive investment companies by financial institutions. This legislation exempts qualifying passive investment companies from the Connecticut corporation business tax and excludes dividends paid from a passive investment company from the taxable income of the parent financial institution. Farmington Bank established a passive investment company in 1999 and substantially eliminated the state income tax expense of Farmington Bank since the passive investment company’s organization through December 31, 2017.
 
We believe we are in compliance with the state passive investment company requirements and that no state taxes relating from Farmington Bank are due for the years ended December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2017; however, we have not been audited by the Department of Revenue Services for such periods. If the state were to determine that the passive investment company was not in compliance with statutory requirements, a material amount of taxes could be due. The State of Connecticut continues to be under pressure to find new sources of revenue, and therefore could enact legislation to eliminate the passive investment company exemption. If such legislation were enacted, we would be subject to additional state income taxes in Connecticut.
 
Farmington Bank and FCB are not currently under audit with respect to their state tax returns, and their state tax returns have not been audited for the past five years.

Massachusetts 
 
We are subject to the Massachusetts income excise tax. The Massachusetts income excise tax is based on the federal taxable income before net operating loss and special deductions and makes certain modifications to federal taxable income to arrive at Massachusetts taxable income. Massachusetts apportioned taxable income is multiplied by the state tax rate (9.0% for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2017 and 2016).
Maryland
 
As a Maryland business corporation, First Connecticut Bancorp, Inc. is required to file an annual income tax return with the State of Maryland.
 
New York 
 
We are subject to the New York corporate franchise tax. The New York corporate franchise tax is based on the federal taxable income before net operating loss and special deductions and makes certain modifications to federal taxable income to arrive at New York taxable income. New York apportioned taxable income is multiplied by the state tax rate (6.5% for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2017 and 2016).
