Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Introduction
 
We are a blank check company formed pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware on November 17, 2016 for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization, exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses or assets. Our efforts in identifying a prospective target business for our initial business combination are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region. We are focused on companies that have an enterprise value of $250 – 500 million or more, that are U.S.-based, have excellent management teams, have growth potential, and that would benefit from access to capital to fund acquisitions or working capital for organic growth. Our management and directors have experience in a diverse range of industries including, but not limited to: business services, distribution, media, telecommunications, technology, retailing, consumer products, education, energy, real estate and financial services.
 
On November 30, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, FMC Merger Subsidiary Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub I”), FMC Merger Subsidiary LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Merger Sub II,) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, C1, the sponsor, in its capacity as the representative for the stockholders of the Company other than the stockholders of C1 (the “C1 Stockholders”), and Clearlake Capital Management III, L.P. in the capacity as the representative for C1 Stockholders (the “Merger”).
 
Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is subject to customary conditions of the respective parties, including the approval of the Merger by our stockholders in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the completion of a redemption offer whereby we will be providing our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of our common stock for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit in our trust account.
 
The Merger Agreement and related agreements are further described in the Form 8-K filed by the Company on December 1, 2017. For additional information regarding C1, the Merger Agreement and the Business Combination, see the Prospectus.
 
Other than as specifically discussed, this Report does not assume that the closing of the Merger will occur.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our strategy is to capitalize on inefficiencies identified in the market, specifically with regards to private equity funds and private companies looking for liquidity.
 
Private equity funds may want to realize their investments by merging a select portfolio company with us. Private equity funds have the opportunity to realize substantial liquidity and maintain a significant ownership stake and upside potential in the on-going merged business. We intend to collaborate with private equity funds to identify a suitable target company. However, we have not yet identified any specific private equity funds with which we intend to collaborate.
 
We are also targeting private companies and divisions of larger companies that are seeking liquidity and facilitate their access to the public equity markets. We believe that our structure provides an excellent option for strong management teams to raise equity growth financing.
 
Consistent with this strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We have used these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, including C1, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.
 

● | Middle-Market Businesses. We are seeking to acquire one or more businesses with an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $250 million to $500 million or more, determined in the sole discretion of our officers and directors according to reasonably accepted valuation standards and methodologies. We believe that the middle market segment provides the greatest number of opportunities for investment. This segment is where we believe we have the strongest network to identify the greatest number of attractive opportunities. We will likely need to issue a substantial number of additional shares of Class A common stock or shares of preferred stock, or a combination thereof, either to sellers of a target company or to investors that will provide us capital, to complete a business combination. For example, we have entered into subscription agreements for the sale of 17,959,375 shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $143,675,000, to be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the Merger.

● | Established Companies with Proven Track Records. We are seeking to acquire one or more established companies with consistent historical financial performance. We are focused on companies with a history of strong operating and financial results and strong fundamentals. We do not intend to acquire start-up companies or companies with recurring negative free cash flow. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Companies with Proven Revenue and Earnings Growth or Potential for Revenue and Earnings Growth. We are seeking to acquire one or more businesses that have achieved or have the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through a combination of organic growth, synergistic add-on acquisitions, new product markets and geographies, increased production capacity, expense reduction and increased operating leverage. 
● | Experienced Management Team. We are seeking to acquire one or more businesses with a complete, experienced management team that provides a platform for us to further develop the acquired business’s management capabilities. We will seek to partner with a potential target’s management team and expect that the operating and financial abilities of our executive team and board will complement their own capabilities. 
● | Sectors Exhibiting Secular Growth or with Potential for Cyclical Uptick. We are focused on acquisition targets in sectors which exhibit positive secular growth or potential for near-term cyclical uptick. We plan to identify sectors that have demonstrated strong positive growth in recent years, possess drivers for continued growth and are strategically positioned to benefit from upswings in their respective industry cycles. 
● | Benefit from Being a Public Company. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that will benefit from being publicly traded and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company. 

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.
 
In addition, the members of our board of directors have significant executive management and both public and private company experience with a diverse range of industries including, but not limited to: business services, distribution, media, telecommunications, technology, retailing, consumer products, education, energy, real estate and financial services. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and board of directors have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we have been, and we believe will be, useful for sourcing investment opportunities.
 
This network has provided our management team with a flow of referrals that have resulted in numerous transactions. We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team have and will provide us with an important source of investment opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates may continue to be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including family offices, investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banks, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises.
 
Significant Activities Since Inception
 
On April 12, 2017, we consummated our initial public offering of 15,000,000 units, each unit consisting of one share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Class A common stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination, and one-half of one warrant, each whole warrant exercisable for one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-216842 and 333-217187). The units were sold in our initial public offering at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $150,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we completed the private placement of 555,000 units, issued to our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $5,500,000.
 
On April 13, 2017, the underwriters of our initial public offering exercised their over-allotment option in full and, on April 18, 2017, the underwriters purchased 2,250,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $22.5 million. On April 18, 2017, simultaneously with the sale of the over-allotment units, the Company completed a private placement with our sponsor for an additional 67,500 units at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $675,000.

Approximately $174 million of the net proceeds from the IPO (including the over-allotment) and the private placements with our sponsor were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders.  
 
Our units began trading on April 7, 2017 on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol FMCIU. Commencing on May 2, 2017, the securities comprising the units began separate trading. The units, common stock, rights and warrants are trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols “FMCIU,” “FMCI,” “FMCIR” and “FMCIW,” respectively.
 
Merger Agreement
 
As discussed above, on November 30, 2017, we entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company will acquire C1.
 
The Agreement provides for a two-step merger: (1) the merger of Merger Sub I with and into C1, with C1 continuing as the surviving corporation (the “Surviving Subsidiary”) and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Forum (the “First Merger”) and (2) the merger of the Surviving Subsidiary of the First Merger with and into Merger Sub II, ceasing the separate existence of the Surviving Subsidiary (the “Second Merger” and together with the First Merger, the “Business Combination”). Merger Sub II will continue as the surviving entity in the Second Merger, and Merger Sub II, continuing as the surviving entity, shall then be referred to as the Surviving Entity (the “Surviving Entity” and, together with Forum, the “Combined Entity”). Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the First Merger (the “Effective Time”):
 
(i) all shares of C1’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (the “C1 Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will be converted into the right to receive the Total Consideration (as defined below), with each stockholder of C1 Stock being entitled to receive its pro rata share of the Total Consideration;
 
(ii) each outstanding convertible security of the company (other than Company Options (as defined below)), if not exercised or converted prior to such time, will be cancelled, retired and terminated and cease to represent a right to acquire, be exchanged for or convert into shares of C1 Stock or if exercised prior to such time, will have the resulting shares of C1 Stock issued upon such exercise treated as outstanding shares of C1 Stock; and
 
(iii) each option to purchase Class A Common Stock that was granted pursuant to the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan of C1 (each such option a “Company Option”) that is unvested as of the Effective Time will become fully vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time. Each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive, (i) with respect to each share of C1 Stock subject to such Company Option, and without interest, an amount of Merger Consideration (as defined below) equal the pro rata share of the Merger Consideration applicable to such share of C1 Stock subject to such Company Option minus the per-share exercise price of such Company Option and (ii) their pro rata share of the Earnout Consideration (as defined below), each (i) and (ii) as provided in the Merger Agreement; provided, however that in order to receive an installment of the applicable pro rata share of the Earnout Consideration, the holder of a Company Option must be an employee of, or in service to, Forum or the Surviving Entity or their respective subsidiaries, at the time such installment is paid or issued, and must deliver a duly executed option cancellation agreement prior to the Effective Time.
 
The aggregate consideration to be paid to C1 securityholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement (subject to certain adjustments as provided therein) will be equal to an amount equal to (i) the enterprise value of $1,137,000,000 minus (ii) the aggregated indebtedness of C1 and its subsidiaries at the time of closing plus (iii) the Closing Cash, plus (iv) the Net Acquisition Amount (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) (which such amount of merger consideration, for the avoidance of doubt includes the Deferred PIPE Closing Amount to be paid after the closing for the Deferred Payment (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement)) (the “Merger Consideration”) plus the contingent right to receive additional consideration based on the performance of the Combined Entity, during the calendar years 2018, 2019 and 2020 (the “Earnout Consideration,” which together with the Merger Consideration, the “Total Consideration”). The Merger Consideration will be paid in the form of: (i) cash (the “Cash Consideration”) from Forum and/or C1 and its subsidiaries in an amount equal to (A) the total cash and cash equivalents of Forum, including funds from the PIPE Investment and the remaining funds in the trust account, after giving effect to the completion of the redemption, plus (B) the closing cash that is not restricted, minus (C) $25,000,000; (ii) a number of our Common Stock, valued at the redemption price per share, equal to the (A) Merger Consideration minus (B) the Cash Consideration minus (C) the Deferred Pipe Closing Amount (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement); and (iii) a deferred payment equal to the Deferred Pipe Closing Amount to be paid upon the consummation of the Deferred PIPE Closing.
 
After the Closing, subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, C1 securityholders will have the contingent right to receive the Earnout Consideration from the Combined Entity, during the calendar years 2018, 2019 and 2020 if certain requirements described in the Merger Agreement and in the Prospectus are met.

We entered into subscription agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell 17,959,375 shares of our Class A common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $143,675,000, immediately prior to closing of the Merger (except for the portion relating to the Deferred Payment (as defined below)) (the “PIPE Investment”). In connection with such PIPE Investment, Mr. Vogel and family members have entered into subscription agreements to purchase an aggregate of $7.876 million of Class A common stock; and Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Katzman have entered into subscription agreements to purchase $2.5 million and $1 million, respectively, of Class A common stock.
 
The PIPE Investment is conditioned on the concurrent closing of the Merger and other customary closing conditions. The proceeds from the PIPE Investment will be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the Merger.
 
For additional information regarding the Merger, please see the Prospectus.
 
Effecting a Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business until the closing of our initial business combination. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of founders’ units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these in effecting a business combination. See “The Merger Agreement” above for a description of the financing agreements entered into in connection with the Merger. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. In the event we do not consummate the Merger, we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, but we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.
 
We have until April 12, 2019 to consummate our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate the Merger or an alternative initial business combination by April 12, 2019, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
 
Sources of Target Businesses
 
We believe based on our management’s business knowledge and past experience that there are numerous acquisition candidates. We expect that our principal means of identifying potential target businesses will, if the Merger is not consummated, continue to be through the extensive contacts and relationships of our officers and directors. While our officers and directors are not required to commit any specific amount of time in identifying or performing due diligence on potential target businesses, our officers and directors believe that the relationships they have developed over their careers and their access to their contacts and resources have and may generate a number of potential business combination opportunities that will warrant further investigation. We also anticipate that target business candidates may continue to be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. They must present to us all target business opportunities that have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income accrued in the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination, subject to any pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations. We have engaged the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions in connection with the Merger, and we may engage these firms or other individuals in connection with an alternative business combination, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will our sponsor, officers, directors or their respective affiliates be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is) other than the $10,000 per month administrative services fee, the repayment of any loans from our sponsor, officers and directors for working capital purposes and reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses. Our audit committee reviews and must approve all reimbursements and payments made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested director abstaining from such review and approval. We have no present intention to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or sponsor. However, we are not restricted from entering into any such transactions and may do so if (i) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested independent directors and (ii) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view.

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
 
Subject to our officers’ and directors’ pre-existing fiduciary duties and the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described above in more detail, and that we must acquire a controlling interest in the target business, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. Except for the general criteria and guidelines set forth above under the caption “Our Strategy,” we have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:
 

● | financial condition and results of operation; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | growth potential; 
● | brand recognition and potential; 
● | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel; 
● | capital requirements; 
● | competitive position; 
● | barriers to entry; 
● | stage of development of the products, processes or services; 
● | existing distribution and potential for expansion; 
● | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services; 
● | proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas; 
● | impact of regulation on the business; 
● | regulatory environment of the industry; 
● | costs associated with effecting the business combination; 
● | industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and 
● | macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes. 

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.

Fair Market Value of Target Business
 
The target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance.
 
We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, such as in connection with the Merger. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of trust account balance test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. In connection with and in the event that the Merger is consummated, immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, the PIPE Investment to fund a portion of the Cash Consideration for the Merger will close. Mr. Vogel, our Executive Chairman, and family members, and Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Katzman, our directors, are participating in such PIPE Investment. The fair market value of any target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
 
We are not required to obtain an opinion from an investment banking firm as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold. In connection with the Merger, we obtained a fairness opinion from Cassel Salpeter & Co., LLC as to (i) the fairness, from a financial point of view, to us of the consideration to be paid by us in the Merger, and (ii) whether C1 had a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of funds in our trust account.
 
Lack of Business Diversification
 
In the event that the Merger is not consummated, we may seek to effect a business combination with more than one target business, and there is no required minimum valuation standard for any target at the time of such acquisition. We expect to complete only a single business combination, although this process may entail the simultaneous acquisitions of several operating businesses. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. 

 
If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management
 
Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. In the event the Merger is consummated, Messrs. Boris and Katzman will serve as directors of the surviving corporation.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination
 
The Merger requires the approval of our stockholders. However, in the event the Merger is not consummated, in connection with any alternative proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender any or all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. In connection with the Merger, we have announced that we are holding a special meeting of stockholders on February 20, 2018. Unlike other blank check companies which require stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and related conversions of public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combination even when a vote is not required by law, we will have the flexibility to avoid such stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait until April 12, 2019 in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.

Our sponsor and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, including the founders’ shares and the shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders’ units, (2) not to convert any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. As a result, we would need only 6,071,251, or approximately 35.2%, of the 17,250,000 issued and outstanding public shares to be voted in favor of a transaction in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming that the 172,500 shares issued to EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (“EarlyBirdCapital”) upon the consummation of our initial public offering are voted in favor of the transaction).
 
If we hold a meeting to approve the Merger or an alternative proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, sponsor or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, sponsor and their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of Class A common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.
 
Conversion Rights
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, such as in connection with the Merger, public stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid (which taxes may be paid only from the interest earned on the funds in the trust account) and any amounts released for working capital purposes. Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of our Class A common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to 20% or more of the shares of Class A common stock sold in our initial public offering. Such a public stockholder would still be entitled to vote against a proposed business combination with respect to all shares of Class A common stock owned by him or his affiliates. We believe this restriction will prevent stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares before the vote held to approve a proposed business combination and attempt to use the conversion right as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then current market price. By limiting a stockholder’s ability to convert no more than 20% of the shares of Class A common stock sold in our initial public offering, we believe we have limited the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block a transaction which is favored by our other public stockholders.
 
Our initial stockholders do not have conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to our initial public offering or purchased by them in our initial public offering or in the aftermarket.
 
We may also require public stockholders seeking conversion, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.
 
Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to stockholders in connection with a vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements, such as in connection with the Merger. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement up until the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. Please see the risk factor titled “We may require stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights” for further information on the risks of failing to comply with these requirements.

The foregoing is different from the procedures historically used by some blank check companies. Traditionally, in order to perfect conversion rights in connection with a blank check company’s business combination, the company would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his conversion rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the conversion price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the conversion rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become a “continuing” right surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a holder’s election to convert his shares is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share of Class A common stock delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the proposed business combination not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.
 
Liquidation if No Business Combination
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we have until April 12, 2019 to complete an initial business combination. If we have not completed an initial business combination by April 12, 2019, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable and up to $100,000 for dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
 
Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed (pursuant to written letter agreements with us filed as exhibits to the registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-216842) that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would stop our public stockholders from converting or selling their shares to us in connection with a business combination or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination by April 12, 2019 unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their shares of Class A common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest not previously released to us but net of franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, or director or any other person.
 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in

Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete a business combination within the prescribed time frame, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable and up to $100,000 for dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following April 12, 2019, and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.
 
We are required to use our reasonable best efforts to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage) and any prospective target businesses enter into agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you of this fact as there is no guarantee that vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. The underwriters of our initial public offering and our auditor are the only third parties we are currently aware of that may not execute a waiver. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.10 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but we cannot assure you that it will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement our sponsor entered into specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Our sponsor may not have sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations, as its only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.10 due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable and up to $100,000 for dissolution expenses.

We anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate such distribution. The holders of the founders’ shares, the shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders’ units, the founders’ rights and the founders’ warrants have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to such founders’ shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our rights or warrants, which will expire worthless. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account and the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that we are permitted to withdraw to pay such expenses.
 
In the event that we do not consummate the Merger, and if we are unable to complete an alternative initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial per-share redemption price would be $10.10. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.
 
Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete a business combination within the required time period or if the stockholders seek to have us convert or purchase their respective shares upon a business combination which is actually completed by us or upon certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation as described elsewhere herein. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.
 
The holders of the founders’ shares, the shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders’ units, the founders’ rights or the founders’ warrants will not participate in any redemption distribution from our trust account with respect to such founders’ shares. Additionally, any loans made by our officers, directors, sponsors or their affiliates for working capital needs will be forgiven and not repaid if we are unable to complete an initial business combination.
 
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.10 per share.
 
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after April 12, 2019, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a majority of our stockholders. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would stop our public stockholders from converting or selling their shares to us in connection with a business combination or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination by April 12, 2019, we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares in connection with any such vote. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer or director or any other person. Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any founders’ shares, shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders’ units, founders’ rights, founders’ warrants, and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

● | we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | if our initial business combination is not consummated by April 12, 2019, then we will redeem all of the outstanding public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve our company; 
● | our shares of Class F common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as provided herein; 
● | upon the consummation of our initial public offering, $174.225 million, was placed into the trust account; 
● | we may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and 
● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional stock that participates in any manner in the proceeds of the trust account, or that votes as a class with the Class A common stock sold in our initial public offering on any matter. 

Competition
 
In the event we do not consummate the Merger, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours in identifying, evaluating and selecting an alternative target business. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
 
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our obligation to convert or repurchase shares of Class A common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; 
● | our Class F stock converting into shares of Class A common stock as described herein; and 
● | our outstanding rights, warrants and unit purchase options, and the potential future dilution they represent. 

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting the Merger or an alternative business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Employees
 
We have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they devote in any time period varies based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Our executive officers devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of the Merger or an alternative business combination.

Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
 
We have registered our units, common stock, rights and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual report will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We have provided stockholders with audited financial statements of C1, and in the event that the Merger is not consummated, we will provider stockholders with audited financial statements of another prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to United States generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.
 
We may be required to have our internal control procedures audited for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
