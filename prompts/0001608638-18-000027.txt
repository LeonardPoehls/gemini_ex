Company Overview
In this section “Civitas”, “we”, “us”, the “Company” and “our” refer to Civitas Solutions, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K we use the term “must serve” to describe the people we serve. We consider “must-serve individuals” to be those that public policy has recognized a responsibility to support because they are highly vulnerable by virtue of a condition acquired at birth or after birth, or their status as a minor, or as elders, and have special needs and/or disabilities such that they need to be supported or cared for in the daily activities of living.
We are the leading national provider of home- and community-based health and human services to must-serve individuals with intellectual, developmental, physical or behavioral disabilities and other special needs. These populations are large, growing and increasingly being served in home- and community-based settings. Our clinicians and direct support professionals develop customized service plans, delivered in non-institutional settings, designed to address a broad range of often life-long conditions and to enable those we serve to thrive in less restrictive settings. We believe we offer a powerful value proposition to government and non-public payors, referral sources and individuals and families by providing innovative, high-quality and cost-effective services that enable greater independence, skill building and community involvement. 
Since our founding in 1980, we have been a pioneer in the movement to provide home- and community-based services for people who would otherwise be institutionalized. During our more than 38-year history, we have evolved from a single residential program serving at-risk youth to a diversified national network providing an array of high-quality services and care in large, growing and highly-fragmented markets. While we have the capabilities to serve individuals with a wide variety of special needs and disabilities, we currently provide our services to individuals with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (“I/DD”), individuals with catastrophic injuries and illnesses, particularly acquired brain injury (“ABI”), youth with emotional, behavioral and/or medically complex challenges, and elders in need of day health services to support their independence. As of September 30, 2018, we operated in 36 states, serving approximately 12,700 individuals in residential settings and approximately 19,000 individuals in non-residential settings. We have a diverse group of hundreds of public payors that fund our services with a combination of federal, state and local funding, as well as an increasing number of non-public payors for our services to individuals with acquired brain injuries or other catastrophic injuries and illnesses. 
Our core strength is providing a continuum of residential, day and vocational programs, and periodic services to support diverse populations with disabilities and special needs. We currently offer our services through a variety of models, including (i) neighborhood group homes, most of which are residences for six or fewer individuals, (ii) host homes, or the “Mentor” model, in which a person lives in the private home of a licensed providers, (iii) in-home settings, within which we support an individual's independent living or provide therapeutic services, (iv) specialized community facilities to support individuals with more complex medical, physical and behavioral challenges, and (v) non-residential care, consisting primarily of day and vocational programs and periodic services that are provided outside the individual's home. As of September 30, 2018, our services were provided by approximately 23,600 full-time equivalent employees, as well as more than 3,500 independently-contracted host home providers.
The Company
Civitas Solutions, Inc. is the parent and public reporting entity of a consolidated group of subsidiaries that market their services under The MENTOR Network tradename. Prior to October 1, 2015, Civitas Solutions, Inc. was a subsidiary of NMH Investment, LLC (“NMH Investment”), which was formed in connection with the acquisition of our business by affiliates of Vestar Capital Partners (“Vestar”) in 2006. Approximately 54% of the Common Stock of Civitas Solutions, Inc. is owned by Vestar. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CIVI . 
Description of Services by Operating Division
We have four operating divisions, Community Support Services ("CSS"), Specialty Rehabilitation Services (“SRS”), Children & Family Services ("CFS") and Adult Day Health ("ADH"). Each operating division represents a reportable segment except ADH, which is included within Corporate and Other, because it does not meet the thresholds for separate reporting. As of October 1, 2018, Community Support Services and Children & Family Services are new names for the operating divisions formerly referred to as Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities ("I/DD") and At-Risk Youth ("ARY") respectively. There were no changes to the composition of the operating divisions as a result of these name changes.
We do not derive any revenues from countries outside the United States.
3

Community Support Services (CSS)
Our CSS operating division is focused on supporting individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities ("I/DD") through programs that include residential support, day habilitation, vocational services, case management, crisis intervention and hourly support care. We provide services to these individuals through small group homes, Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual and/or Developmental Disabilities (“ICFs-I/DD”), host homes, in-home settings and non-residential settings. We operate approximately 1,500 group homes and 150 ICFs-I/DD. As of September 30, 2018, we provided CSS services to approximately 18,500 individuals in 21 states. In fiscal 2018, our CSS services generated net revenue of $1,025.6 million, representing 64.0% of our net revenue. We receive substantially all our revenue for CSS services from a diverse group of state and local governmental payors.
Specialty Rehabilitation Services (SRS)
Our SRS operating division delivers health care and community-based health and human services to individuals who have suffered acquired brain injury, spinal injuries and other catastrophic injuries and illnesses. 
Our SRS operating division is focused on rehabilitation and transitional living services and more medically-intensive post-acute care services. Our SRS services range from sub-acute healthcare for individuals with intensive medical needs to day treatment programs, and include: neurorehabilitation; neurobehavioral rehabilitation; specialized nursing; physical, occupational and speech therapies; supported living; outpatient treatment; and pre-vocational services. Our goal is to provide a continuum of care to allow individuals to achieve the highest level of function possible while enhancing their quality of life. We provide these services primarily through specialized community facilities, small group homes, in-home and non-residential settings. As of September 30, 2018, our SRS operations provided services in 25 states and served approximately 2,200 individuals nationally. In fiscal 2018, our SRS services generated net revenue of $356.3 million, representing approximately 22.2% of our net revenue. In fiscal 2018, we received 51% of our SRS revenue from non-public payors, such as commercial insurers, workers’ compensation funds, managed care and other private payors and 49% from state, local and federal governmental payors.
Children & Family Services (CFS)
Our CFS operating division is focused on supporting youth with emotional, behavioral and/or medically complex challenges through programs that include therapeutic foster care, family preservation, adoption services, early intervention, school-based services and juvenile offender programs. Our individualized approach allows us to work with an ever-changing population that is diverse demographically as well as in type and severity of condition. We provide these services through host homes, group homes, educational settings, in their family homes and in other non-residential settings. As of September 30, 2018, we provided CFS services to approximately 6,000 children, adolescents and their families in 9 states. In fiscal 2018, our CFS services generated net revenue of $147.7 million, representing 9.2% of our net revenue. We receive substantially all our revenue for CFS services from a diverse group of state and local governmental payors.
Adult Day Health (ADH)
Our newest operating division, ADH, delivers elder services including case management, nursing oversight, medication management, nutrition, daily living assistance, transportation, and therapeutic services. Our adult day health facilities provide outpatient, center-based services to approximately 5,000 adults in a group environment in 4 states. In fiscal 2018, our ADH services generated net revenue of $72.6 million, representing 4.5% of our net revenue. We receive substantially all our revenue for ADH services from state and local governmental payors.
Industry Overview
We provide home- and community-based services to large populations of individuals with intellectual, developmental, physical or behavioral disabilities and other special needs. These populations are must serve due to the nature of their disabilities, which in many cases are life-long and irreversible, or their status as children, adolescents, or elders. Within the broader health and human services market, we currently serve four primary populations:

• | Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (I/DD). Based on reports prepared by Dr. David Braddock, public spending on I/DD services was estimated to be $65.2 billion in 2015, of which approximately 85% was spent to provide services in community settings of six or fewer beds, our target market, and for other non-institutional services, including supported living, supported employment and family assistance. In 2015, there were approximately

4

5.1 million individuals with an intellectual or developmental disability across the nation. Over the past two decades, the delivery of services to the I/DD population in supervised residential settings has grown significantly and, at the same time, there has been a shift from institutional settings to home- and community-based settings. Dr. Braddock is Associate Vice President of the University of Colorado (CU) System and Executive Director of the Coleman Institute for Cognitive Disabilities. 

• | Acquired Brain Injury (ABI). The market for acute care and rehabilitation for individuals with ABI is approximately $10.0 billion annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the Brain Injury Association of America (“BIAA”), more than 3.2 million children and adults sustain a brain injury each year, many of which result in complex, life-long medical and/or behavioral issues that require specialized care. Approximately 5.3 million individuals in the United States are living with permanent disability as a result of an ABI. Many of these individuals are currently served in costly and often medically inappropriate care settings such as long-term acute care facilities and nursing homes. We expect that there will be a continuing shift in care delivery to more appropriate community-based settings such as those that we offer.


• | Children & Family Services (CFS). According to reports published by the organization Child Trends, an estimated $29.1 billion was spent in state fiscal year 2014 on child welfare, including spending for residential and non-residential family support services such as those that we offer. Approximately 4.1 million referrals for abuse or neglect, which involved an estimated 7.4 million children, were investigated or assessed in the United States in federal fiscal year 2016. An estimated 688,000 children and adolescents were served by the foster care system in 2016. According to the Federal Department of Health and Human Services AFCARS data, there were nearly 437,000 children and adolescents in foster care as of September 30, 2016. Of those individuals, approximately 196,000 are living in non-relative foster family homes, which includes the therapeutic foster care market, the primary market for our residential CFS services.


• | Adult Day Health (ADH). The ADH portion of the elder services market is an estimated $8.5 billion based on an IBISWorld 2018 report. IBISWorld forecasts growth to be at an annualized rate for ADH of 5.5% with revenue for this industry projected to reach $11.1 billion in 2021. We believe that there will be a growing demand for ADH services for several reasons, including that the population of adults 65 years of age and older is a growing demographic. According to the United States Census Bureau, the population of individuals age 65 and older will reach 82.8 million by 2050, almost double the estimated population of 49.2 million in 2016. Moreover, states are increasingly looking for alternatives to more expensive models of home-based, residential and institutional care. The ADH market, like other markets in which we operate, is highly fragmented with opportunities for consolidation.

Our Business Strategy
We believe the market opportunity for home- and community-based health and human services that increase independence and participation in community life for the individuals we serve while reducing costs will continue to grow. We intend to continue leveraging our strengths to capitalize on this trend, both in existing markets and in new markets where we believe significant opportunities exist. The primary aspects of our strategy include the following:
Pursue Opportunistic Acquisitions.
As a leading provider in our markets with national scale and a proven track record of quality care, we are well positioned as an acquiror of choice for small operators in a highly-fragmented industry. This dynamic leads to a number of attractive acquisition opportunities that can drive returns. We continue to maintain a robust acquisition pipeline and deploy capital in a disciplined and opportunistic manner to pursue acquisitions.
We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions that are consistent with our mission and complement our existing operations. We have invested in a team dedicated to mergers and acquisitions, as well as the infrastructure and formalized processes to enable us to pursue acquisition opportunities and to integrate them into our business. 
We monitor the market nationally for businesses that we can acquire at attractive prices and efficiently integrate with our existing operations. From the beginning of fiscal 2014 through September 30, 2018, we have successfully acquired 55 companies, at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $329.5 million, including $9.7 million to settle contingent consideration obligations.
Leverage our Core Competencies to Drive the Organic Growth of High-Quality Services.
5

We expect to capture the embedded growth opportunities resulting from organic growth initiatives and leverage our core competencies to further expand our presence in markets we currently serve and to further expand our geographic footprint in our existing service lines. During our 38-year history, we have developed and refined a core set of competencies through our experience developing customized service plans for complex cases and supporting our operations with expertise in areas such as quality improvement, risk management, compliance and quality improvement.
Continue to Invest in our New Start Programs.
A key driver of growth has been our new start programs that have historically generated attractive returns on our investments. Our demonstrated ability to quickly launch new start programs positions us well to meet new sources of market demand. New starts, which typically turn profitable within 18-24 months, require modest investments, consisting of operating losses and capital expenditures. Investments in the form of operating losses of approximately $16.3 million in new starts between fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013 generated net revenues and operating income of approximately $83.4 million and $22.0 million, respectively, in fiscal 2018. Investments in the form of operating losses of approximately $11.8 million in new starts between fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 generated net revenues and operating income of approximately $57.1 million and $9.4 million, respectively, in fiscal 2018. Investments in the form of operating losses of approximately $13.0 million in new starts between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 generated net revenues and operating income of approximately $33.7 million and $4.6 million, respectively in fiscal 2018. We have made a number of recent investments that we believe will continue to drive near term growth as they reach maturity. Our average annual new start investment in fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2018 was approximately $6.4 million. We intend to continue to aggressively pursue new start opportunities with attractive rates of return.
Expand our SRS Platform.
We intend to leverage our scale and leadership position to continue to expand our SRS platform through continued organic growth in new and existing markets, as well as through opportunistic acquisitions. We are the only provider with a national platform dedicated to providing post-acute care for individuals with brain injuries or other catastrophic injuries and illnesses, and thus we believe we are the leader serving this market. We have grown our SRS operating division revenue by over 70 percent since fiscal 2013, achieving a 11.3% compound annual growth rate in net revenue over that period. Furthermore, our SRS business is funded by a highly attractive payor mix, with approximately 51% of net revenues in fiscal 2018 derived from commercial insurers and other private entities.
Pursue Opportunities in Adjacent Markets and Complementary Service Lines that Diversify our Service Offerings.
 We have a proven track record of developing new service areas, as evidenced by the growth of our SRS segment, and we intend to leverage our core competencies and relationships with state agencies to pursue opportunities in adjacent markets, particularly the $7.1 billion market for ADH, which we entered in 2014 with the acquisition of the Mass Adult Day Health Alliance. Since completing this acquisition, we have opened two additional ADH centers in Massachusetts and have acquired seven additional companies located in Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey and New Hampshire. We are continuing to evaluate opportunities to expand this service both organically and through potential acquisitions. In the future, we may explore additional opportunities to leverage our periodic, day and residential service models to support individuals in the broader elder care market as well as other adjacent markets, such as those serving youth with autism and individuals with mental health needs.
Customers and Contracts
Our customers that pay us to provide services to the individuals we support are governmental agencies, non-public payors and not-for-profit organizations. Our CSS and CFS services, as well as a significant portion of our SRS services, are delivered pursuant to contracts with various governmental agencies, such as state departments of developmental disabilities, juvenile justice, child welfare and the Federal Veterans Health Administration. Such contracts may be issued at the county or state level, depending upon the structure of the service system of the state in question. In addition, approximately 51% of our SRS revenue is derived from contracts with commercial insurers, workers’ compensation carriers and other non-public payors.
In all of our service lines, either the individuals that we support and/or the payors/referral sources (e.g., state agencies) select us as a provider and, although an individual funded by Medicaid has the right to choose an alternative provider at any time, it has been our experience that the individuals we support change providers infrequently. We believe that many of the individuals we support develop close relationships with their direct support professionals and our organization. Although an individual may develop a close relationship with his or her direct support professional, it is our experience that if such direct support professional leaves our employment, the individuals we support rarely elect to switch providers based on such direct support professional's departure. The length of stay varies widely based on individual needs. For instance, in our SRS segment, 
6

an individual's care may be focused on rehabilitation, in which case we will provide services for several months, or, if an individual suffered a catastrophic illness or accident, that individual could remain in our care for the duration of their life, which could span years or decades. In our CSS business, the length of stay is generally years, and often we support individuals for decades. In our CFS business, the length of treatment can vary widely but most often is for several months.
Contracts may cover a range of individuals such as all children referred for host home services in a county or a particular set of individuals who will share group living arrangements. Contracts are sometimes issued for specific individuals, where rates are individually determined based on need. Although our contracts generally have a stated term of one year and generally may be terminated without cause on 60 days’ notice, the contracts are typically renewed annually if we have complied with licensing, certification, program standards and other regulatory requirements. As a provider of record, we contractually obligate ourselves to adhere to the applicable federal and state regulations regarding the provision of services, the maintenance of records and submission of claims for reimbursement under Medicaid and other government programs. In addition, while we are not obligated to serve each individual that is referred to us, we make every effort to review referrals made and accept individuals who need our services.
During fiscal 2018, revenue from our contracts with state and local governmental payors in the states of Minnesota, California, Massachusetts, Ohio and Indiana, our five largest revenue-generating states, comprised 41% of our net revenue. During fiscal 2017, revenue from our contracts with state and local governmental payors in the states of Minnesota, California, Indiana, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, our five largest revenue-generating states, comprised 40% of our net revenue. During fiscal 2016, revenue from our contracts with state and local governmental payors in the states of Minnesota, California, Indiana, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, our five largest revenue-generating states, comprised 41% of our net revenue. Of the 36 states the Company operates in, Minnesota is our largest state and generates revenue from our contracts with state and local governmental payors which accounted for 16%, 15%, and 15% of our net revenue in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Contracts with state and local governmental payors in California, our second largest state, accounted for 10% of our net revenue in fiscal years 2018 and 2017. No other states accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue during fiscal years 2018, 2017, or 2016.
Training and Supporting our Direct Support Professionals
We provide pre-service and in-service education to all of our direct support professionals and clinical and administrative staff, and we encourage staff to avail themselves of outside training opportunities whenever possible. Employees participate in orientation programs designed to increase their understanding of our mission, philosophy of service, and our Code of Conduct and compliance program. Our employees benefit from our library of training materials and an intranet site that facilitates the identification and exchange of expertise across all of our operations. We work to increase individual job satisfaction and retention of motivated and qualified employees.
We use equally rigorous methods to identify and contract with independent contractor providers (host home providers), whether in an adult host home or foster care environment. In addition to pre-service and in-service orientation to familiarize the host home providers to the specifics of our model and expectations, the contracted host home providers in our CSS and CFS businesses receive a detailed briefing tailored to the individualized needs of the individual or child placed in their home. Prior to any placements being made, we conduct a home study to evaluate the appropriateness of any placement and conduct interviews and criminal background checks on adult members residing in the host home provider household. The services provided by host home providers are evaluated for contractual compliance by our case manager or coordinator according to standards set by licensing and regulatory agencies as well as our own quality standards. While host home providers can provide services independently, they have access to emergency telephone triage and on-site crisis intervention, if necessary. Host home providers also avail themselves of support groups, whether independent or offered at the program office.
Employees and Independent Contractors
As of September 30, 2018, we had approximately 23,600 full-time equivalent employees and more than 3,500 independent contractors. Although our employees are generally not unionized, we have one business in New Jersey with approximately 40 employees who are represented by a labor union and one business in Florida with approximately 62 employees that voted to unionize in June 2018. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Sales/Business Development and Marketing
We market our services nationally as The MENTOR Network, a national network of local service providers. We operate under several brands across the country, predominantly under the REM and MENTOR brands in our CSS and CFS operating divisions and the NeuroRestorative and CareMeridian brands in our SRS operating division.
7

The majority of individuals we serve in the CSS and CFS operating divisions come to us through third-party referrals, and frequently our CSS referrals come through recommendations to family members from state or local agencies. Since our operations depend heavily on these referrals, we seek to ensure that we provide high-quality services in all states in which we operate, allowing us to enhance our name recognition and maintain a positive reputation with state and local agencies.
Relationships with referral sources are cultivated and maintained at the local level by key operations managers and supported by an array of corporate resources including marketing communications, government relations and business development services to promote both new and existing product lines.
Our SRS sales activities are independently organized from those of our CSS and CFS businesses. We have dedicated, geographically assigned clinical marketing and sales staff cultivating relationships with public and private payors, referral sources and directly with potential participants and their families. These regional teams are also supported by corporate resources as outlined above.
To further distinguish ourselves in each operating division, we have established a comprehensive presence at both the national and local level through a robust online presence, including social media. Additionally, through our government relations and business development activities, we believe we have successfully positioned ourselves to anticipate and meet the needs of our public partners.
Competition
Community Support Services (CSS)
The CSS market is highly fragmented, with both not-for-profit and for-profit providers ranging in size from small, local agencies to large, national organizations. We and the other leading national provider account for less than 4% of services by revenue in the CSS market. Although state and local governments continue to supply a small percentage of services, the majority of services are provided by the private sector. Not-for-profit organizations are also active in all states and range from small agencies serving a limited area with specific programs to multi-state organizations. Many of the not-for-profit companies are affiliated with advocacy groups such as community mental health and religious organizations.
Specialty Rehabilitation Services (SRS)
We compete with local providers, both large and small, including hospitals, post-acute rehabilitation facilities, residential community-based facilities, day treatment centers and outpatient centers specializing in long-term catastrophic care and short-term rehabilitation. This market also includes several large national providers of general inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services.
Children & Family Services (CFS)
The CFS market is extremely fragmented, with several thousand providers in the United States. Competitors include both not-for-profit and for profit local providers serving one particular geographic area to a single state, and, to a limited extent, multi-state providers.
Adult Day Health (ADH)
The ADH market in the United States is highly fragmented, with approximately 12,500 providers operating 15,300 centers according to IBISWorld. The majority of providers are relatively small companies, and only 33% of these providers have two or more locations. In 2016, the National Center on Health Statistics reported that for-profit providers served approximately 45% of the nearly 286,000 individuals who received this service.
Regulatory Framework
We must comply with comprehensive government regulation of our business, including federal, state and local statutes, regulations and policies governing the licensing of services, the quality of service, participation in State and Federal payment systems, the revenues received for services, and reimbursement for the cost of services. State and federal regulatory agencies have broad discretionary powers over the administration and enforcement of laws and regulations that govern our operations.
The following regulatory considerations are critical to our operations:
8

Funding. Federal and state funding for our services is subject to frequent statutory and regulatory changes, contracting and managed care initiatives, level of care assessments, court orders, rate setting and state budgetary considerations, all of which may materially increase or decrease reimbursement for our services. We actively participate in local and national legislative initiatives that seek to impact funding and regulation of our services. We derive revenues for our CSS and CFS services and a significant portion of our SRS services from Medicaid programs.
Licensure and qualification to deliver service. We are required to comply with extensive licensing and regulatory requirements applicable to the services we deliver. These include requirements for participation in the Medicaid program, state and local contractual obligations, and requirements relating to individual rights, the credentialing of individual employees and contract Mentors (including background and Office of Inspector General checks), the quality of care delivered, the physical plant and facilitation of community participation. Compliance with state licensing requirements is a prerequisite for participation in government-sponsored public health care assistance programs, such as Medicaid. To qualify for reimbursement under Medicaid, facilities and programs are subject to various requirements imposed by federal and state authorities. We maintain a licensing database that tracks activity impacting licenses governing the provision of services.
In addition to Medicaid participation requirements, our facilities and services are subject to annual or semi-annual licensing and other regulatory requirements of state and local authorities. These requirements relate to the condition of the facilities, the quality and adequacy of personnel staff and service ratios and the quality of services provided. State licensing and other regulatory requirements vary by jurisdiction and are subject to change and local interpretation.
From time to time we receive notices from regulatory inspectors that, in their opinion, there are deficiencies resulting from a failure to comply with various regulatory requirements. We review such notices and take corrective action as appropriate. In most cases we and the reviewing agency agree upon the steps to be taken to address the deficiency and, from time to time, we or one or more of our subsidiaries may enter into corrective action plans with regulatory agencies requiring us to take certain actions in order to maintain our licenses or certification. Serious or repeat deficiencies, or failure to comply with corrective action plans, may result in the assessment of fines or penalties, referral holds, payment suspensions and/or decertification or de-licensure actions by various federal or state regulatory agencies.
We deliver services and support under a number of different funding and program provisions. Our most significant sources of funding for our CSS services are home and community based waiver programs ("HCBS Waiver"), Medicaid programs for which eligibility is based on a set of criteria (typically disability or age) established by the state and approved by the federal government. There is no uniformity among states and/or regulations governing our delivery of waivered services to individuals. Each state where we deliver services operates under a plan submitted by the state to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) which approves the state plan and thereby authorizes the state to use Medicaid funds in non-institutional settings using federal financial participation (“FFP”). Typically the state writes state specific regulations governing providers and services provided under the state waiver program. Consequently, there is no uniform method of describing or predicting the content or impact of regulations across states where we deliver HCBS Waiver services. On March 17, 2014, a federal regulation governing HCBS Waiver programs became effective. The rule establishes eligibility requirements for payment for Medicaid home and community-based services provided under the “waiver” program. Under the rule, home- and community-based settings must be integrated in and support full access to the greater community, be selected by the individual from different setting options, ensure individual rights of privacy, and optimize autonomy and independence in making life choices. The rule includes additional requirements for provider-owned or controlled home and community-based residential settings, including that the individual has a lease or other legally enforceable agreement, and standards related to the individual’s privacy, control over schedule and visitors, and physical accessibility of the setting. States have the option to request a variation or delay of compliance with the federal standards for as long as five (5) years from the effective date. Each state has its own implementation scheme and schedule, which presents implementation costs and challenges. At this juncture seven states and the District of Columbia have received final approval of their Statewide Transition Plans, and it remains unclear how other states will implement this regulation. Accordingly, the total cost of compliance with the HCBS waiver remains uncertain. 
In addition, our ICFs-I/DD are governed by federal regulations, and may also be subject to individual state rules that vary widely in application and content. Federal regulations require that in order to maintain Medicaid certification as an ICF-I/DD, the facility is subject to annual on-site survey (a federal rule and process implemented by state agencies), the results of which provide or deny the certification necessary to bill Medicaid for services in the facility. Failure to successfully pass this inspection and remedy all defects or conditions cited may result in a finding of immediate jeopardy or other serious sanction and, ultimately, may cause a loss of both certification and funding for that particular facility.
9

Similarly, child foster care and other children’s services are largely governed by individual state regulations which vary both in terms and regulatory content. Failure to comply with any state’s regulations requires remedial action on our part and a failure to adequately remedy the problem may result in provider or contract termination.
All states in which we operate have adopted laws or regulations which generally require that a state agency approve us as a provider, and many require a determination that a need exists prior to the admission of covered individuals or services. Provider licenses are not transferable. Consequently, should we intend to acquire, develop, expand or divest services in any state or to enter a new state, we may be required to undergo a rigorous licensing, transfer and approval process prior to conducting business or completing any transaction.
Similarly, some states have a formal Certificate of Need (“CON”) process, whereby the state health care authority must first determine that a service proposed is needed under the state health plan, prior to any service being licensed or applied for. The CON process varies by state and may be formal in design, encompassing any transfer, organizational change, capital improvements, divestitures or acquisitions. Formal processes may include public notice, opportunity for affected parties to request a hearing prior to the health care authority approving the project, as well as an opportunity for the state authority to deny the project. Other states have a less formal process for CON application and approval and may be limited to new or institutional projects. Very few states require CON approval for waivered services. Failure to comply with a state CON process may result in a prohibition on Medicaid billing and may subject the provider to fines, penalties, other civil sanctions or criminal penalties for the operators or owners of an unapproved health service.
Other regulatory matters. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or “HIPAA,” as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), set national standards for the protection of health information created, maintained or transmitted by health providers. Under the law and regulations known collectively as the privacy and security rules, covered entities must implement standards to protect and guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information, report breaches and undertake notification and remedial steps consistent with regulation.
Federal regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA and the HITECH ACT contain, among other measures, provisions that require organizations to implement significant and expensive computer systems, employee training programs and business procedures. Rules have been established to protect the integrity, security and distribution of electronic health and related financial information. Many states have also implemented extensive data privacy and security laws and regulations. Failure to timely implement or comply with HIPAA or other data privacy and security regulations may, under certain circumstances, trigger the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The federal False Claims Act imposes civil liability on individuals and entities that submit or cause to be submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government. Violations of the False Claims Act may include treble damages and penalties of up to $11,000 per false or fraudulent claim. Similarly, retention of any overpayments may be regarded by the government as a false claim.
In addition to actions being brought by government officials under the False Claims Act, this statute and analogous state laws also allow a private individual with direct knowledge of fraud to bring a “whistleblower” claim on behalf of the government for violations. The whistleblower receives a statutory amount of up to 30% of the recovered amount from the government’s litigation proceeds if the litigation is successful or if the case is successfully settled. Recently, the number of whistleblower suits brought against healthcare providers has increased dramatically, and has included suits based (among other things) upon alleged violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Law.
The Anti-Kickback Law prohibits kickbacks, rebates and any other forms of remuneration in return for referrals. Any remuneration, direct or indirect, offered, paid, solicited or received, in return for referrals of patients or business for which payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicaid, could be considered a violation of law. The language of the Anti-Kickback law also prohibits payments made to anyone to induce them to recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering any goods, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part by Medicaid. Criminal penalties under the Anti-Kickback Law include fines up to $25,000, imprisonment for up to 5 years, or both. In addition, acts constituting a violation of the Anti-Kickback Law may also lead to civil penalties, such as fines, assessments and exclusion from participation in the Medicaid program.
Additionally we must comply with local zoning and licensing ordinances and requirements. The Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 protects the interests of the individuals we serve, prohibits local discriminatory ordinance practices and provides additional opportunities and accommodations for people with disabilities to live in their community of choice.

Federal regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) require us to have safety plans for blood borne pathogens and other work place risks. At any point in time OSHA investigators may receive a complaint which requires on-site inspection and/or audit, the outcome of which may adversely affect our operations.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 provided a mandate for more vigorous and widespread enforcement and directed state Medicaid agencies to establish Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) programs. RACs are private entities which will perform audits on a contingency fee basis, giving them an incentive to identify discrepancies in payments, from which they may be permitted to extrapolate disproportionately large penalties and fines. States were required to be in compliance by January 1, 2012 unless granted an extension. We have experienced only modest RAC auditing activity to date; however this remains a fairly new federal initiative and the ultimate impact remains unclear. Only the passage of time and our experience with enforcement and compliance will permit our assessment of the exact impact the new statute and regulations have on our business.
Similarly the HIPAA and HITECH Regulations increased both the scope of liability and obligations of business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services, as well as increase disclosure obligations of providers in the event of a breach. The Federal enforcement agency has expressed an intent to increase investigations and potential penalties for noncompliance in part due to these new standards.
Managed care initiatives have recently been undertaken in certain states, notably in Iowa and Wisconsin, and those initiatives have impacted our business by modifying the types of services eligible for payment, the qualifications required for payment and the rates that are paid for those services.  Managed care organizations ("MCOs") undertake frequent rate changes some of which are difficult to predict and the impact of those changes may reduce our revenue and ability to bill for services.  In addition, as MCOs merge with others or leave the marketplace we may experience higher unpaid receivables as we enter into new contracts with the MCO's successor. Similarly, some states are pursuing waivers for dual-eligible populations (that is, persons eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid), and our ability to participate in such waivered services in some markets may depend on our ability to become a Medicare provider.
We participate in Medicare in a very select number of areas of the country, as well as in managed care projects that allocate funds for recipients who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare has a unique and different set of regulations, funding mechanisms and audit and compliance risks compared to Medicaid. In recent years, states have begun working toward maximizing Medicare funding for services for dual eligible populations due to the fiscal incentive to lower state contributions and shift the cost of service to Medicare. In some state markets “equalization” of rates is required, thereby mandating that the rates we charge to private payors may not exceed rates established and paid by Medicaid and/or Medicare. Public policy initiatives and cost-containment initiatives in the Medicare program may continue and may affect our operating margins where we participate in Medicare.
Conviction of abusive or fraudulent behavior with respect to one facility or program may subject other facilities and programs under common control or ownership to disqualification from participation in the Medicaid program. Executive Order 12549 prohibits any corporation or facility from participating in federal contracts if it or its principals (included but not limited to officers, directors, owners and key employees) have been debarred, suspended or declared ineligible or have been voluntarily excluded from participating in federal contracts. In addition, some state regulations provide that all facilities licensed with a state under common ownership or control are subject to delicensure if any one or more of such facilities are delicensed.
We must also comply with the standards set forth by the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) governing internal compliance and external reporting requirements. We regularly review and monitor OIG advisory opinions, although they are often limited in their application to community-based Medicaid providers. Significant legislative, media and public attention has recently focused on health care. Because the law in this area is complex and continuously evolving, ongoing or future governmental investigations or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with our current practices. It is possible that outside entities could initiate investigations or future litigation impacting our services and that such matters could result in penalties and adverse publicity. It is also possible that our executive and other management personnel could be included in these investigations and litigation or be named defendants.
We are also subject to a large number of employment related laws and regulations, including laws regarding discrimination, wrongful discharge, retaliation, and federal and state wage and hours laws.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, and the rules and regulations thereunder (together, the “Affordable Care Act”), imposed requirements and restrictions, including, but not limited to, guaranteed coverage requirements, prohibitions on some annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to our employees, increased restrictions on rescinding coverage, establishment of minimum medical loss ratio

requirements, the establishment of state insurance exchanges and essential benefit packages, and greater limitations on product pricing. 
A material violation of a law or regulation could subject us to fines and penalties and in some circumstances could disqualify some or all of the facilities and programs under our control from future participation in Medicaid or other government programs. Failure to comply with laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.
A Compliance Officer (vice president level position) oversees our compliance program and reports to our Chief Legal Officer, a management compliance committee, the board’s quality and risk management committee and the board’s audit committee, as applicable. The program activities are reported regularly to the management compliance committee which includes the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Quality Officer, as well as HR, legal and other quality improvement leaders. In addition, the program activities are periodically reported at the board level.
Seasonality
In general, our financial performance is not significantly impacted by fluctuations from seasonality.
