ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Freight Solution, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 28, 2016, at which time it acquired a business plan and certain intangible assets from Mr. Shane Ludington. Mr. Ludington has been working on the development and implementation of the Company uber-type smartphone application, the business and its operations for a period of more than five years. As of July 28, 2017, we had two employees, which includes our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ludington, and a code programmer. From the date of inception, April 28, 2016, through this report date, Mr. Ludington has continued to devote at least ten (10) to twenty (20) hours per week as necessary for our operations. Mr. Ludington performs these services for free and there is no contractual agreement in place with the Company. Mr. Ludington is not required to work a minimum number of hours per week or per month to the Company. The number of hours is solely reliant upon Mr. Ludington’s judgment and availability. For calendar year 2017, Mr. Ludington has committed to continue providing these services for free. In addition to his role with the Company, Mr. Ludington runs a trucking service for small to medium sized business entities (“SMB”) that handles freight duties, deliveries and logistics services between Sacramento, Southern California and Arizona. Mr. Ludington’s business activities sometimes extend to Nevada and Utah on a limited basis.
 
The Company issued 11,000,000 shares of its common stock to Mr. Ludington at inception in exchange for organizational services. The services were valued at $11,000. Following formation, Mr. Ludington sold the Company a comprehensive and extensive business plan which outlines our business objectives incorporating an uber-type application for the less-than-truckload (“LTL”) service industry. Many years of research and development efforts went into the business plan and its development. The business plan sale includes software code and programming language developed for the Company’s intended product. The Company issued 4,000,000 shares of common stock with a stated value of $4,000. Mr. Ludington incurred more than $10,000 in costs associated with the development of the original business plan, software development (or coding) costs as well as other expenses in this pursuit.
 
We are an early stage company with limited financial resources. We have not established or attempted to establish a source of equity or debt financing, however, we intend to have conversations with advisors and smaller statured investment banks or financial institutions regarding our financing needs. Our auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements that states that “the Company’s losses from operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.” We are at the early stages of development for our business and its operations. While we are a development stage business we do not consider ourselves a shell company as that term is defined in Rule 405. 
 
We have business operations, which commenced most recently as a Nevada company early in 2016 through our incorporation with the Secretary of State - Nevada. Operations are more than nominal. We have not generated any revenue. We improved upon and added several key targets and objectives to our acquired business plan. We hired several industry consultants to assist with the coding and program language for our software, as well as establishing a network of business sources in the logistics industry. We have incurred significant costs related to both development efforts and expect to incur more over the next few years. In the lifecycle of coding and smart-app development, we are in the beginning ‘design phase’. We have also completed what is called the framework, which includes a substantive requirements analysis, design specifications which our software coders use as a roadmap. We have a significant amount of work that needs to be done and significant working capital needs to be secured in order to bring our intended products and services to, and compete within, the marketplace. 
 
To date, we have not developed any saleable product or services of our intended LTL management service application and controls platform. We cannot predict when a saleable product or service will ever be developed and released into the marketplace. We believe we have an advantage directly derived from our founder and his industry relationships and through the help that these key relationships will provide in executing and completing our business model. Our loss before provision for incomes taxes for the year ended April 30, 2017 was approximately $133,000. We recorded no provision for federal or state income taxes during the twelve month period ended April 30, 2017. We have not generated any revenues from our intended LTL service management products or LTL management information services (see Management’s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operations).
 
The Company has no current intentions, plans, arrangements, commitments or understandings to engage in a merger or acquisition with another company nor does the Company or any of its shareholders have any plans to enter into a change of control or similar type of transaction.

We are building an LTL service management company that we believe will provide comprehensive LTL management solutions for the freight delivery business. We are developing a proprietary LTL service application and control platform that will provide an Uber/Lyft transformation to the logistics industry from the ground up. We believe product functionality, when fully developed, will provide scalability by enabling users to utilize a smartphone app or internet based service that provides on-demand service to logistics consumer (shippers). Both will connect willing shippers to logistics providers (commercial haulers or truck drivers). Our mobile app will allow shippers to connect with truck drivers in the same way that San Diegans can find a ride home that is an alternative to a cab ride. Based on capacity demands, shippers can find the driver that is best suited to their freight demands for a pre-determined price. This is the freight solution way. Our application allows you to move full or less than truckload freight with an easy tap of your finger. To capture these opportunities, we must identify significant cost savings and define an economic return for the logistics consumer. Our intended software we believe will become a building block in the design, development, and the arrangement of LTL management services for SMB’s and large multinational organizations.
 
Our intended software and services will outline a three-step method for providing shippers with what we believe to be a comprehensive approach providing a smartphone and web-based application for logistics providers focusing on the less-than-truckload (LTL) services offered, utilizing an Uber-type product allowing truck drivers to enhance and optimize their assets (their long haul equipment), through sophisticated analysis and algorithms. Shippers will be able to augment their usual fleet of logistic providers when capacity demands exceed their typical network. The trucker or logistics provider will be able to respond directly to the shippers needs and pick up additional loads that would convert a LTL delivery to a full-truck-load (“FTL”) (or a load that will fill up the entire truck) delivery. These extra loads fill trucks that otherwise remain empty, or bobtailing it. We believe this approach is required for proper logistics decisions to be made, and will help us in creating long-lasting customer relationships with both shippers and truck drivers.
 
Our business operations will be comprised of two segments; a) software (Apple iOs and android based, as well as web based formats) and b) software integration services for the commercial shippers market. Our software division works with the assistance of an established coding and smart-app development firm. The coding and smart-app development firm is located in San Diego, California. The coding and smart-app development firm provides a selection of experienced developers for us to use on our product, and the hourly rate ranges from $75.00 to $200.00 per hour. We are billed by the hour and on an as needed basis. We are under no contractual agreement with the firm. Our founder, Mr. Ludington, has been working with this firm in some capacity since January 2013. Mr. Ludington conveyed this relationship through the sale of intangible assets to the Company. We developed our initial LTL and logistics management software framework primarily through the efforts of our founder, and the efforts of a this firm. Again, we work with this firm on an as “needed basis.” We have not had any material discussions regarding the acquisition of software for services products, nor do we have any agreements (written or oral) in place in order to do so. The software framework and design has been developed, no software application distributor or reseller relationship has been formalized; the Company intends to seek help from outside sales representatives and marketing consultants to develop a professional sales and marketing strategy to capitalize on our technologies. With further financing we intend to create and staff an in-house coding and smart-app development group, which we believe may develop new versions of the applications and/or services, of a similar nature to business development in LTL management service solutions. The Company continues to work on the development of its LTL management service solutions services through the management and industry knowledge skills of its founder, as well as through a coding and smart-app development firm which has been working with us on an as needed basis and as our budget allows.
 
To date, no saleable product or service has been developed through these efforts. The services segment of our operations we will seek to staff with a team with the skills necessary in technology and logistics management service. Contract sizes may vary. While we cannot estimate the size of contracts, availability of contracts are solely based on the industry observations. None of these observations are based on any formal study. Initially our clients (or shippers) we believe may come from referrals, or business relationships that our founder, and Chief Executive Officer has or through general marketing in the industry. We cannot predict when those referrals will occur, or if at all, through Mr. Ludington or others.
 
Business 
 
There is no way of accurately predicting when product development will progress to the point of generating any revenue. The timing of development is a function of having sufficient working capital. There is no way of knowing when or if we will be able to raise the funds necessary. If we do, services could be ready in six to nine months following when the necessary funds have been secured. If we do not raise sufficient financing, revenue producing activities of any kind will most likely not commence for at least 18 months, if ever.

We believe this approach is required for proper logistics decisions to be made, and will help us in creating long-lasting customer relationships with both shippers and truck drivers.
 
Our business operations will be comprised of two segments: a) software application packaging (Apple (“iOs”) and android (“APK”) based, as well as standardized web based formats) that are easily installed, sophisticated and robust enough to handle massive data volume; and b) software integration services for commercial shipping market, enabling both users and providers to maximize their efforts. Our software division works with the assistance of an established coding and smart-app development firm. We developed our initial LTL and logistics management software framework primarily through the efforts of our founder, and the efforts of a coding and smart-app development firm with which the Company works on an as “needed basis.” We have not had any material discussions regarding the acquisition of software for services products, nor do we have any agreements (written or oral) in place in order to do so.

We cannot predict when those referrals will occur, or if at all, through Mr. Ludington or others.
 
Our plan to continue as a going concern is to reach the point where we begin generating sufficient revenues from our LTL service management products and services to meet our obligations on a timely basis. The Company has not yet acquired or internally fully developed any of these intended services. We may not be able to acquire or internally develop any services in the future because of a lack of available funds or financing to do so. In order for us to develop or acquire any services, we must be able to secure the necessary financing, beyond just the proceeds of our direct public offering. In the early stages of our operations, we will continue to keep costs to a minimum. The cost to develop our business plan as currently outlined will be in excess of $300,000. We have no established current sources of funds to undertake the business plan as outlined. Until we obtain funding, if ever, we will keep our operating costs as low as possible with our founder providing substantially all of the work on his own without any cash compensation. This methodology would result in our development stage extending for at least two to three years. We however believe that our services division (once developed, if at all) may begin to generate revenues earlier than the software division (once developed, if at all). If we are unable to obtain adequate funding or financing, the Company faces the ultimate likelihood of business failure. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise any funds or establish any financing program for the Company’s growth.

Industry Overview
 
Based on industry reports, nearly 70 percent of all freight moved in the United States travels by truck. It is believed by most that without trucks and driver, the U.S. economy would come to a screeching halt. Despite the importance of the industry progress has been slow to move freight easily and with electronic assistance due to the fragmentation of the industry. The fragmentation requires tens of thousands of small operators requiring intermediaries to transact business with shippers. These intermediaries (brokers) typically rely on the telephone to engage the two parties. This is definitely not the most efficient or cost-effective means of moving freight in the age of on-demand commerce.
 
There are a number of mobile application operators entering into the shipping/logistics paradigm. These mobile application operators believe by replacing the traditional middleman linking truckers to shippers and vice versa, the developing applications are shaping up to be transformative to the industry. This is believed to be the direction the industry is heading, such as Uber was for the taxi business. These mobile application operators believe by leveraging the Uber-like similarities transporting freight can be as easy as moving people were. Algorithms which are central them to Uber and its transformation of the taxi business, these very same mathematical calculations using sophisticated software code can fill the needs between the shipper and trucker. Matching the two electronically through the Internet-of-things, while providing financial logistics, along with billing and payment, all handled by the application. 
 
We believe that the large LTL management market and the geographically fragmented service provider landscape will seek to utilize sophisticated LTL service management systems to solve market barriers. This industry transformation will accelerate shipping, reduce costs, and remove the middleman using a sophisticated algorithm all in a smart-phone, which presents a unique opportunity for the Company.
 
Competitive Focus
 
We believe the following will assist us in capitalizing on expected growth in the commercial LTL management market: (1) Scalability. We believe our LTL service management system will be a scalable solution, designed to serve the underserved, fragmented LTL management market. (2) Comprehensive Solution. We believe that our intended product will provide both shipper and trucker the ability to connect and schedule transport at a competitive price, based on distance, weight size and several other customary variables. (3) Analytical Expertise. Our founder and his network of personal contacts have an extensive LTL service management experience which we will seek to capitalize on the combined expertise. (4) Speed of Implementation. We believe that a fully-developed LTL service management system will be quickly implemented, providing additional insight into the usage of the shippers’ assets.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Key elements of our growth strategy shall include: (1) Core Product Enhancement. We plan to enhance core product user interface and functionality with new features and offerings as soon as reasonably practicable. (2) Focus on Markets. We intend to grow our market by: (a) securing contracts in local and national markets, (b) entering new commercial markets, (c) leveraging development opportunities, and (d) adding focused LTL logistics management solutions to our portfolio. (3) Acquire Complementary Businesses. We plan to acquire businesses that complement and expand our intended LTL management information services, technology, customer base and geographic coverage. (4) Align with Logistics Operators. We believe establishing relationships with small to medium size operators will enable us to reach and attract a broader customer base. (5) Strategic Alliances. We plan to team with other industry businesses that have complementary features to our LTL service management system, when fully developed, reducing development cost and opening doors to other shippers and truckers. (6) National Expansion. We intend to expand nationally through partnerships and alliances, moving beyond our initial geographic focus.
Business Objective
 
The Company’s objective is to become a preferred provider of LTL service management solutions and other related services for small to medium sized business entities in Southwestern region of the US. The Company is pursuing the following strategy to achieve this objective: (1) Enhance Technical Expertise. We will seek to enhance our technical expertise by hiring and training of information technology personnel with industry experience. (2) Create a Geographic Presence. We will seek to create a geographically optimized reputation and market our intended LTL management information services. (3) Quality, Service and Support. Our employees and selected tech professionals will follow documented and standardized methodologies to ensure that we provide a consistent approach to projects, thereby fostering uniform quality and cost-efficient solutions for the end-users. (4) Customer Base. Our intended products and services will most likely permit interaction with diverse points of contact decision makers. (5) Alliances with Industry Leaders. We expect to create key alliances and relationships with freight delivery business vendors, and service providers. We will pursue key alliances and relationships in order to expand our offerings and remain current with the advances in the logistics industry as well as information management technology. (6) Multiple Sales Channels. We believe that we can attract a direct sales force that will focus exclusively on our intended LTL service management product and services.

This Annual Report includes limited market and industry data and forecasts that we obtained from our own research, publicly available information, industry periodicals and surveys. Industry publications and surveys generally state that the information contained herein has been obtained from sources deemed reliable. While we have not been able to verify such information to the extent that we deem qualified in its entirety we have determined based on our knowledge to be sufficient and accurate for presentation. Unless otherwise noted, statements as to market position as related to market competitors these are all approximated. Industry and market data could be proven wrong because of the method by which sources obtained their data and because information cannot always be verified with certainty due to limits on availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the data gathering process, limitations and other uncertainties. We do not know all or tested all of these assumptions regarding general economic conditions. The industry in which we operate is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described in the section entitled “Risk Factors.”
 
Competition
 
A series of startups and old-line trucking businesses are vying to be the Uber of trucking. The focus is simple: leveraging truck drivers’ smartphones to quickly connect them with nearby businesses to ship goods. Startups are aiming to reinvent the fragmented U.S. freight delivery business. The freight delivery business has long relied on third-party brokers, who are basically travel agents for trucking. These trucking travel agents connect truckers with customers. And we all know what happened to the travel agent industry: competition, consolidation, cost savings, and change. 
 
A surge in investing during 2015 into tech startups focused on longer-haul freight. What is described as the “final mile” type solutions for moving freight attracted new investment in select companies. These companies include: Transfix, iContainers, Freightera and CargoX, all four of which commenced operations in July 2016; Haven, started in May 2016; Fleet, which started in April 2016; Convoy, which started in March 2016; Freightos and Cargo Chief, both started in September 2015; Flexport, which started in August 2015; and Cargomatic, Fourkites, and Truckerpath, all of which commenced operations in early 2015. Most of the above-referenced companies are well-funded, some with “big league” name investors with significant pull and name recognition.
 
There are readymade solutions for transportation industry that are more expansive than what we plan to offer. Our solution will compete with many of these alternative solutions by offering a cost-effective quality focused LTL services management solution in an already crowded transportation field. These transportation execution marketplace solutions allow shippers to tender to (contract with) carriers, then book and pay for the shipment with ease. Well-established freight marketplace participants dominate the market in ocean and international shipping. We believe that when it comes to the local marketplace we will be able to compete on quality and price. We are not an all-encompassing solution, we are a core focused product, with an eye on parcel and rail. We believe that with price discovery, a sensitive requirement for buyers of services, combined with reputable carrier confirmation, and load optimization that we will have a captive consumer. Optimization along with reputable carrier confirmation will allow loads to be cleverly combined so that freight travels via lower cost modes on the most efficient route possible, with on-time arrival to boot. 
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have no patents or trademarks that have been applied for or granted.

 
Government Regulation and Industry Standards
 
There are an increasing number of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad pertaining to communications and commerce on the Internet. In addition, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals are under consideration by federal, state, local as well as foreign governments. Laws or regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet relating to actual and perceived liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet, user privacy, taxation and the quality of services. 
 
Moreover, the application of existing laws, governing issues, such as intellectual property ownership and infringement, pornography, obscenity, libel, gaming, employment and personal privacy is most uncertain and constantly developing. Any such legislation or regulation, or the application, interpretation of existing laws, may decrease the overall growth in the use of the Internet, preventing us from delivering content in different parts of the world and may increase our costs of goods sold, and otherwise affect our business operations. Furthermore, legislation regulating online content could limit the growth in use of the Internet generally and decrease the overwhelming acceptance of the Internet as an advertising and e-commerce medium.
 
Websites typically place identifying data, or cookies, on a user's hard drive without the user's knowledge or consent. We and many other Internet companies will use cookies for a variety of different reasons, including the collection of data derived from the user's Internet activity. Any reduction or limitation in the use of cookies could limit the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. Most currently available browsers allow users to remove cookies at any time or to prevent cookies from being stored on their hard drive.

Some privacy advocates and governmental bodies have suggested limiting or eliminating the use of cookies. In addition, the European Union and many countries within the EU have adopted privacy directives or laws that strictly regulate the collection and use of information regarding Internet users that is identifiable to particular individuals. Privacy legislation has been proposed in the US as well, and the US Federal Trade Commission has taken action against website operators that do not comply with state privacy policies. These and other governmental efforts may limit our ability to target advertising or collect and use information regarding the use of our websites. Fears relating to a lack of privacy could also result in a reduction in the number of users and subscribers which could harm our business and financial results. 
 
Our intended customers and end users are, on the other hand, burdened with government regulation and standards that make it difficult to operate. Our customer operations are regulated and licensed by various government agencies in the US. Their drivers must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those relating to drug- and alcohol-testing and hours-of-service. Weight and equipment dimensions also are subject to government regulations. They also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions, drivers' hours-of-service, driver eligibility requirements, on-board reporting of operations, ergonomics and other matters affecting safety or operating methods. Other agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and the Department of Homeland Security, also regulate their equipment, operations and drivers and may affect us to our own detriment. 
 
The DOT, through FMCSA, imposes safety and fitness regulations on our intended customers and their drivers. In December 2011, FMCSA released its final rule on hours-of-service, which retained the current 11-hour daily driving time limit, reduced the maximum number of hours a driver can work within a week from 82 hours to 70 hours and expanded the 34-hour restart provision to require any restart period to include two consecutive nighttime periods from 1:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. Additionally, the final rule limits the number of consecutive driving hours a driver can work to eight hours before requiring the driver to take a 30-minute break. Interstate motor carriers and drivers were required to comply with the final hours-of-service rule by July 1, 2013. 
 
In 2010, FMCSA introduced a new enforcement and compliance model that ranks both fleets and individual drivers on seven categories of safety-related data and will eventually replace the current Safety Status measurement system, or SafeStat. The seven categories of safety-related data, known as Behavioral Analysis Safety Improvement Categories, or BASICs, include Unsafe Driving, Hours-of-Service, Driver Fitness, Controlled Substances and Alcohol, Vehicle Maintenance, Cargo-Related and Crash Indicator. In 2012, CSA modified several BASICs categories by moving certain violations previously classified within the Cargo-Related category to the Vehicle Maintenance category and simultaneously renamed the Cargo-Related category to the Hazardous Materials Compliance category, which identifies hazardous material related safety and compliance problems. The new measurements expand the current methodology for determining a carrier's DOT safety rating. Certain BASICs information has been published and made available to carriers and the public. Based on these publicly disclosed results, rankings score may be acceptable for some and unacceptable for others’ scores are preliminary and are subject to change by FMCSA. Although certain BASICs information has been made available to carriers and the public, the SafeStat measurement system remains in effect. FMCSA is considering additional revisions to the rating system and the safety labels assigned to motor carriers evaluated by the DOT. Under a revised rating system, our intended customers safety rating could be evaluated more regularly and reflect a more in-depth assessment of safety-based violations and effect their ability to attract business despite timeliness and price. 
 
On July 6, 2012, the President of the United States signed into law MAP21. Included in MAP21 is a provision that mandates electronic logging devices in commercial motor vehicles. The provision tasks the Secretary of Transportation with issuing regulations to require the use of electronic logging devices for the purpose of recording hours-of-service in commercial motor vehicles. During 2012, FMCSA published a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking announcing its plan to proceed with the Electronic On-Board Recorders and Hours of Service Supporting Documents rulemaking. Most of our intended customers we believe will have already installed in-cab communication systems in their tractors, which include electronic logging devices, in conjunction with efforts to improve efficiency and communications with their drivers and possible integration with our intended software product. 
 
In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, federal, state and municipal authorities implemented and continue to implement various security measures on large trucks, including checkpoints and travel restrictions. The Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, has adopted regulations that require a determination by the TSA that each driver who applies for or renews his or her license for carrying hazardous materials is not a security threat. 
 
Our intended customers are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling and handling of hazardous materials, fuel storage tanks, emissions from their vehicles, engine-idling, discharge and other environmental matters that involve inherent environmental risks. Our intended customers we believe will have instituted programs to monitor and mitigate environmental risks and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws. As part of their safety and risk management program, they should periodically perform internal environmental reviews which may be a factor that will be included in our software.

The EPA adopted emissions control regulations that require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines manufactured on or after October 1, 2002. More stringent reductions became effective on January 1, 2007 for engines manufactured on or after that date, and further reductions became effective on January 1, 2010. Compliance with the regulations has increased the cost of customer new tractors and operating expenses while reducing fuel economy. In October 2010, the DOT's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, and the EPA proposed regulations that regulate fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions. On November 14, 2011, the NHTSA and the EPA finalized regulations that regulate fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions beginning in 2014 through 2018. In the state of California, the California Air Resources Board has adopted its own regulations, including requiring new performance requirements for diesel trucks, with targets to be met between 2011 and 2023, implementing its own trailer regulations, which require all 53-foot or longer box-type trailers (dry vans and refrigerated vans) that operate at least some of the time in California (no matter where they are registered) to meet specific aerodynamic efficiency requirements when operating in California and requiring operators to register California-based refrigerated trailers with the California Air Resources Board. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2010, all 2011 model year and newer 53-foot or longer box-type trailers subject to the California regulations were required to be either SmartWay certified or equipped with low rolling resistance tires and retrofitted with SmartWay-approved, aerodynamic technologies. Beginning December 31, 2012, pre-2011 model year 53-foot or longer box-type trailers (with the exception of certain 2003 to 2008 refrigerated van trailers) must meet the same requirements as 2011 model year and newer trailers or have prepared and submitted a compliance plan, based on fleet size, that allows them to phase in their compliance over time. Compliance requirements for 2003 to 2008 refrigerated van trailers will be phased in between 2017 and 2019. Federal and state lawmakers also have proposed potential limits on carbon emissions under a variety of climate-change proposals, including certain states and municipalities which continue to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel-powered tractors, may idle, in order to reduce exhaust emissions. Since a significant portion of our future customer base will operate or reside in California, these regulations will have a significant effect. 
 
In addition, increasing efforts to control emissions of greenhouse gases are likely to have an impact on our intended customers and us. The EPA has announced a finding relating to greenhouse gas emissions that may result in promulgation of greenhouse gas air quality standards. Federal and state lawmakers are also considering a variety of climate-change proposals. New greenhouse gas regulations could increase the cost of new tractors, impair productivity and increase operating expenses to our potential customers and affect our business in a negative manner. 
 
Tax and other regulatory authorities have, in the past, sought to assert that independent contractor drivers in the trucking business are employees rather than independent contractors. Federal legislators have introduced legislation in the past to make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractor drivers as employees, including legislation to increase recordkeeping requirements for those using independent contractor drivers and to heighten the penalties of employers who misclassify their employees and are found to have violated employees' overtime and/or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice. If customers, specifically truck drivers with single tractor operations are determined to be employees, they would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholding affecting our business overall. 
 
Employees
 
As of July 28, 2017, we had two employees, including our founder, Mr. Ludington. During the remainder of calendar year 2017 (dependent on our financing and available working capital), Mr. Ludington will devote at least 20 hours a week to us and he may increase the number of hours as he deems necessary. Mr. Ludington is able to devote this time to our Company as he is not limited or restricted from being involved with us by his current employer. Mr. Ludington has no formal services agreement with the Company. At some future date we may be limited in seeking the employment of others to assist in the execution and furtherance of the business plan. Our founder has committed to provide us with all administrative and planning work, as well as to perform our basic coding for software and initial marketing efforts on his own. He expects to do this without any cash compensation while he seeks sources of funding for the Company and our business plan.
 
Management believes that Mr. Ludington has been fully compensated through the issuance of common stock or equity in the Company, and he will forego any cash payment for his services now or into the future. Mr. Ludington believes this in the best interest of the Company and for any prospective investor who may invest in the Offering. We currently work with an independent software development firm, which has been utilized on an “as needed” basis, and we may in the future use other independent contractors, consultants, and other software development firms to assist in many aspects of our business on an “as needed” or per project basis pending adequate financial resources being available or their ability to defer payment for their services.
