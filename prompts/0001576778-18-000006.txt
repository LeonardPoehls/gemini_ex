Item 1.  Description of Business 
Introduction
 
This annual report on Form 10-K is a comprehensive filing for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015. It is being filed by us to move toward becoming current in our filing obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This is our first periodic filing since we filed a Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, on August 24, 2015. Included in this report are the audited financial statements that would have been included in annual reports on Form 10-K which were not previously filed for the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, as well as summarized quarterly financial information which would have been included in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which were not previously filed for each of the quarters ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, March 31, 2016 and 2017 , and June 30, 2016 and 2017.

Our delinquencies with regard to these filings were due to the fact that the Company discontinued operations after June 30, 2015, because the Companys prior business plan proved to not be viable and the Company was not able to generate cash flows sufficient to continue operations, and subsequently certain of the Companys creditors sued the Company, obtained default judgements and put the Company into receivership.
 
This annual report should be read together and in connection with the other reports that have been filed by us with the SEC for a comprehensive description of our financial condition and operating results. In the interest of disclosure, we have included information in this annual report certain material events and developments that have taken place through the date of filing of this annual report with the SEC.
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, UBL Interactive, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, is referred to in this document as UBLI, we, us, or the Company), incorporates by reference certain information from parts of other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Securities and Exchange Commission allows us to disclose important information by referring to it in that manner. Please refer to all such information when reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All information is as of September 30, 2017 unless otherwise indicated. 


Overview of Business History
 
UBL Interactive, Inc. (UBLI or the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 30, 2009.

UBLI, until it ceased operations in July 2015, provided a comprehensive set of online identity management tools and services to businesses seeking to optimize their presence in location - 
 based search results on web, mobile and social platforms. 

Our Operations
We are a shell company as that term is defined under federal securities laws. Our business plan is to seek to acquire assets or shares of an entity actively engaged in business that generates revenues in exchange for our securities. We will not restrict our search to any specific business, industry, or geographical location and we may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature. This discussion of the proposed business is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of our virtually unlimited discretion to search for and enter potential business opportunities. Management anticipates that it may be able to participate in only one potential business venture because we have nominal assets and limited financial resources. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk to our stockholders because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.
Plan of Operations

We currently plan to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation and, to a lesser extent that desires to employ our funds in its business. Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.

The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of S. Mark Spoone, our sole officer and director. We have not had any conversations with potential merger or acquisition targets nor have we entered into any definitive agreement with any party. In our efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we may consider the following kinds of factors:

 Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products;
  Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole;
  Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment;
  Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by us or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
  The cost of participation by us as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials;
  The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced;
  The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and
  Other relevant factors.

In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, our management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and decide based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the limited capital we have available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired.

The way we participate in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, our respective needs and desires as well as those of the promoters of the opportunity, and the relative negotiating strength of ourselves and such promoters.

It is likely that we will acquire our participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other securities. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called "tax free" reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), depends upon the issuance to the stockholders of the acquired company of at least 80% of the common stock of the combined entities immediately following the reorganization. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other "tax free" provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares. Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 10% of the total issued and outstanding shares. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were our stockholders prior to such reorganization.
 

Our present stockholder will likely not have control of a majority of our voting shares following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, our current director may resign and new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.

In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of our management without any vote or approval by stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving our company, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders' meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval if possible.

It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in our loss of the related costs incurred.

During the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, and the interim fiscal quarters since that time, we have essentially been dormant. On or about August 8, 2017, the General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division, State of North Carolina, County of Mecklenburg, in the matter of William Alessi v. UBL Interactive, Inc. and Does I-V, inclusive, case number 17 CvS 7847, entered an order pursuant to which the court (i) assumed jurisdiction of the Company and all of its assets, and (ii) appointed Angela Collette the receiver (the Receiver) over the Company and its property effective August 8, 2017.

We do not currently engage in any business activities that provide us with positive cash flows. As such, the costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next approximately 12 months and beyond will be paid with our current cash and if necessary, with additional funds raised through other sources, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.
