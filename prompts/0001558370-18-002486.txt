             ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
     RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
     On September 27, 2018, the Company and Old Line Bancshares, Inc. (“Old Line Bancshares”), the parent company of Old Line Bank, a Maryland trust company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company will be merged with and into Old Line Bancshares, with Old Line Bancshares as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”). The Merger Agreement, which has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, provides that each outstanding share of the Company’s common stock will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of common stock of Old Line, with the exact exchange ratio to be determined prior to closing. Immediately following the Merger, the Company’s federal savings bank (“FSB”) subsidiary, Bay Bank, FSB (the “Bank”), will be merged with and into Old Line Bank, with Old Line bank as the surviving depository institution (the “Bank Merger”).
     Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, the approval of the Merger by the stockholders of Old Line Bancshares and the Company and the receipt of required regulatory approvals. The stockholders of the Company and of Old Line Bancshares approved the Merger at special meetings thereof held on March 28, 2018. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) approved the Merger and related transactions on March 2, 2018, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) approved the Bank Merger on March 6, 2018, and the Maryland Commissioner of Financial Regulation approved the Bank Merger on March 9, 2018. Therefore, all required stockholder and regulatory approvals with respect to the Merger and its related transactions have now been received. However, a lawsuit has been filed against the Company, its directors and Old Line
 Bancshares pursuant to which the plaintiff seeks, among other things, to enjoin the Merger unless certain conditions are satisfied. Information about this lawsuit is set forth in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report under the heading, “Pending litigation related to the Merger may delay or prevent the Merger and could cause Old Line Bancshares and the Company to incur significant costs and expenses.”
     The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. The
 Merger Agreement contains termination rights of the Company and Old Line Bancshares and further provides that we will be required to pay Old Line Bancshares a termination fee of $5,076,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances set forth therein.
     We expect the Merger to close on or about April 13, 2018, but this date is subject to change. For additional information regarding the pending Merger, please see as our definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and
 Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 14, 2018, as updated from time to time.

 You should keep in mind that discussions in this annual report that refer to the Company’s business, operations and risks in the future refer to the Company as a stand-alone entity up to the closing of the proposed Merger or if the Merger does not close, and that these considerations will be different with respect to the combined company after the closing of the Merger.
     GENERAL  
     The Company, a Maryland corporation organized in 1990, is a savings and loan holding company headquartered in Columbia, Maryland. The Bank is also headquartered in Columbia, Maryland.  Until November 1, 2013, the Company operated under the name Carrollton Bancorp.  Effective November 1, 2013, the Company’s name was changed to Bay Bancorp, Inc. 
 We are focused on providing superior financial and customer service to small and medium-sized commercial and retail businesses, owners of these businesses and their employees, to business professionals and to individual consumers located in the central Maryland region, through our network of 11 branch locations.  We attract deposit customers from the general public and use such funds, together with other borrowed funds, to make loans.  Our results of operations are primarily determined by the difference between interest income earned on our interest-earning assets, primarily interest and fee income on loans, and interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and borrowings.
 Our mortgage division is in the business of originating residential mortgage loans and then selling them to investors.  The mortgage banking business is structured to provide a source of fee income largely from the process of originating residential mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market.  Mortgage banking products include Federal Housing Administration and Federal Veterans Administration loans, conventional and nonconforming first and second mortgages, and construction and permanent financing.  Loans originated by the mortgage division are generally sold into the secondary market or retained by us as part of our balance sheet strategy. As part of planning for our proposed Merger, we expect to close this division in February 2018.
 Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.  The total investment in joint ventures at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 is not considered material to the consolidated financial statements as a whole.
  On July 8, 2016, the Company completed its merger with Hopkins Bancorp, Inc. (“Hopkins”), the parent company of Hopkins Federal Savings Bank (“Hopkins Bank”), in which Hopkins was merged into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation.  Immediately following that merger, Hopkins Bank was merged into the Bank, with the Bank as the surviving FSB (these merger transactions are collectively referred to as the “Hopkins Merger”).  In the Hopkins Merger, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Hopkins for $23,855,141 in cash, with each outstanding share of Hopkins common stock converted into the right to receive $98.7578 in cash. The Bank acquired Hopkins Bank’s 51% interest in iReverse Home Loans, LLC (“iReverse”), which is engaged in the business of brokering reverse mortgage loans.  Effective March 31, 2017, the Bank sold its interest in iReverse to the other owner of iReverse for $70,000.
     The Bank has three wholly-owned subsidiaries, Hopkins Financial Corporation, Hopkins Properties, Inc. and Encore Mortgage, Inc., all of which are Maryland entities that were acquired in the Hopkins Merger and engage in the business of investing excess cash in certificates of deposit issued by other depository institutions.

 MARKET AREA 
     We consider our core markets to be the communities within the Baltimore Metropolitan Statistical Area, particularly Baltimore City and the Maryland counties of Baltimore, Anne Arundel, Howard and Harford, as well as south along the Baltimore-Washington corridor with an expanded focus on Prince George’s and Montgomery counties.    Lending activities are broader, including the entire State of Maryland, and, to a limited extent, the surrounding states.  All of our revenue is generated within the United States.     COMPETITION
     Our principal competitors for deposits are other financial institutions, including other savings institutions, commercial banks, credit unions, and local banks and branches or affiliates of other larger banks located in our primary market area.  Competition among these institutions is based primarily on interest rates and other terms offered, service charges imposed on deposit accounts, the quality of services rendered, and the convenience of banking facilities.  Additional competition for depositors' funds comes from mutual funds, U.S. Government securities, insurance companies and private issuers of debt obligations and suppliers of other investment alternatives for depositors such as securities firms.  Competition from credit unions has intensified in recent years as historical federal limits on membership have been relaxed.  Because federal law subsidizes credit unions by giving them a general exemption from federal income taxes, credit unions have a significant cost advantage over banks and savings associations, which are fully subject to federal income taxes.  Credit unions may use this advantage to offer rates that are highly competitive with those offered by banks and thrifts.
     Current federal law allows the acquisition of banks by bank holding companies nationwide. Further, federal and Maryland law permit interstate banking. Recent legislation has broadened the extent to which financial services companies, such as investment banks and insurance companies, may control commercial banks. As a consequence of these developments, competition in our principal market may increase, and a further consolidation of financial institutions in Maryland may occur.
     STRATEGY
     We operate on the premise that the consolidation activities in the banking industry have created an opportunity for a well-capitalized community bank to satisfy banking needs that are no longer being adequately met in the local market.  Large national and regional banks are catering to larger customers and provide an impersonal experience, and typical community banks, because of their limited capacity, are unable to meet the needs of many small-to-medium-sized businesses.  Specifically, as a result of bank mergers in the 1990s, many banks in the Baltimore metropolitan area became local branches of large regional and national banks.  Although size gave the larger banks some advantages in competing for business from large corporations, including economies of scale and higher lending limits, we believe that these larger, national banks remain focused on a mass market approach which de-emphasizes personal contact and service.  We also believe that the centralization of decision-making power at these large institutions has resulted in a lack of customer service.  At many of these institutions, determinations are made at the out-of-state “home office" by individuals who lack personal contact with customers as well as an understanding of the customers' needs and scope of the relationship with the institution.  We believe that this trend is ongoing, and continues to be particularly frustrating to owners of small and medium-sized businesses, business professionals and individual consumers who traditionally have been accustomed to dealing directly with a bank executive who had an understanding of their banking needs with the ability to deliver a prompt response. 
     We attempt to differentiate ourselves from the competition through personalized service, flexibility in meeting the needs of customers, prompt decision making and the availability of senior management to meet with customers and prospective customers.

 PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
     General
     Our primary market focus is on making loans to and gathering deposits from small and medium-sized businesses and their owners, professionals and executives, real estate investors and individual consumers in our primary market area.  We lend to customers throughout Maryland, with our core market being the Baltimore Metropolitan Statistical Area and along the Baltimore-Washington corridor. To a limited extent, we lend to customers in neighboring states.  Our lending activities consist generally of short to medium term commercial lending, commercial mortgage lending for both owner occupied and investor properties, residential mortgage lending and consumer lending, both secured and unsecured.  A substantial portion of our loan portfolio consists of loans to businesses secured by real estate and/or other business assets.     Lending Activities 
     Credit Policies and Administration
     We have adopted a comprehensive lending policy, which includes stringent underwriting standards for all types of loans.  Our lending staff follows pricing guidelines established periodically by our management team.  All loan approvals require at least two signatures; no individual commercial loan authority is given to Recommending Officers (“RO”).  Loans up to $1,500,000 must be approved by the RO, Line Executive (“LE”) and Credit Administration (“CA”).  CA includes the Chief Credit Officer (“CCO”) and/or a senior vice president (“SVP”) of CA.  LEs include Baltimore Area President, Corridor Area President and Head of Real Estate.  Loans between $1,500,001 and $3,000,000 must be approved by the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) or LE and CCO.  Loans between $3,000,001 and $5,000,000 must be approved by the Credit Risk Management Committee (“CRMC”) which consists of the CEO, LEs, CCO and SVP CA.  Loans greater than $5,000,001 must be approved by the Board Loan and Risk Committee with the prior approval of the CRMC.  Under the leadership of our executive management team, we believe that we employ experienced lending officers, secure appropriate collateral and carefully monitor the financial conditions of our borrowers and the concentration of loans in our portfolio.
     All loans by the Bank to our directors and executive officers and their affiliates require pre-approval by the Bank’s Board of Directors to ensure, among other things, compliance with Section 23A and Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated thereunder.  It is the Bank’s policy that all approved loans must be made on substantially the same terms as loans made to persons who are unrelated to the Bank.
     In addition to the normal repayment risks, all loans in the portfolio are subject to the state of the economy and the related effects on the borrower and/or the real estate market.  Generally, longer-term loans have periodic interest rate adjustments and/or call provisions.  Senior management monitors the loan portfolio closely to ensure that we minimize past due loans and that we swiftly deal with potential problem loans.  
     The Bank also retains an outside, independent firm to review the loan portfolio.  This firm performs a detailed annual review.  We use the results of the firm’s report primarily to validate the risk ratings applied to loans in the portfolio and identify any systemic weaknesses in underwriting, documentation or management of the portfolio.  Results of the annual review are presented to executive management, the audit committee of the board and the full board of directors and are available to and used by regulatory examiners when they review the Bank’s asset quality.  
     The Bank maintains the normal checks and balances on the loan portfolio not only through the underwriting process but through the utilization of an internal credit administration group that both assists in the underwriting and serves as an additional reviewer of underwriting.  The separately managed loan administration group also has oversight for documentation, compliance and timeliness of collection activities.  Our outsourced internal audit firm also reviews documentation, compliance and file management.

 Commercial Lending
     Our commercial lending consists of lines of credit, revolving credit facilities, accounts receivable and inventory financing, term loans, equipment loans, small business administration (SBA) loans, stand-by letters of credit and unsecured loans.  We originate commercial loans for any business purpose, including the financing of leasehold improvements and equipment, the carrying of accounts receivable, general working capital, contract administration and acquisition activities.  These loans typically have maturities of seven years or less.  We have a diverse client base and we do not have a concentration of these types of loans in any specific industry segment.  We generally secure commercial business loans with accounts receivable and inventory, equipment, indemnity deeds of trust and other collateral such as marketable securities, cash value of life insurance, and time deposits at the Bank.  Commercial business loans have a higher degree of risk than residential mortgage loans because the availability of funds for repayment generally depends on the success of the business.  To help manage this risk, we establish parameters/covenants at the inception of the loan to provide early warning signals before payment default.  We normally seek to obtain appropriate collateral and personal guarantees from the borrower’s principal owners.  We are able, given our business model, to proactively monitor the financial condition of the business.     Commercial Real Estate Lending
     We finance commercial real estate for our clients, for both owner-occupied properties and investor properties (including residential properties).  We generally will finance owner-occupied and investor commercial real estate at a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80%.  Our underwriting policies and processes focus on the underlying credit of the owner-occupied real estate and on the rental income stream (including rent terms and strength of tenants) for investor commercial real estate as well as an assessment of the underlying real estate.  Risks inherent in managing a commercial real estate portfolio relate to vacancy rates/absorption rates for surrounding properties, sudden or gradual drops in property values as well as changes in the economic climate.  We attempt to mitigate these risks by carefully underwriting loans of this type as well as by following appropriate loan-to-value standards.  We are cash flow lenders and never rely solely on property valuations in reaching a lending decision.  Personal guarantees are often required for commercial real estate loans as they are for other commercial loans.  Most of our real estate loans carry fixed interest rates and amortize over 20 – 25 years with five- to 10-year maturities.  Properties securing our commercial real estate loans primarily include office buildings, office condominiums, distribution facilities, retail properties, manufacturing plants and apartment projects.  Substantially all of our commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area.
     Commercial real estate loans generally carry higher interest rates and have shorter terms than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.  Commercial real estate loans, however, entail significant additional risks as compared with residential mortgage lending, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers.  In addition, the payment of loans secured by income producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service.  Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property.  Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial real estate than residential properties.
     Construction Lending
     Construction lending can cover funding for land acquisition, land development and/or construction of residential or commercial structures.  Our construction loans generally bear a variable rate of interest and have terms of one to two years.  Funds are advanced on a percentage-of-completion basis.  These loans are generally repaid at the end of the development or construction phase, although loans for commercial construction will often convert into a permanent commercial real estate loans at the end of the term of the loan.  Loan-to-value parameters range from 65% of the value of raw land to 75% for developed land and 80% for commercial or multifamily construction and residential construction.  These loan-to-value ratios represent the upper limit of advance rates to remain in compliance with Bank policy.  Typically, loan-to-value ratios should be somewhat lower than these upper limits, requiring the borrower to provide significant equity at the inception of the loan.  Our underwriting looks not only at the value of the property but 

 
  8

 
the expected cash flows to be generated by sale of the parcels or leasing of the completed construction.  The borrower must have solid experience in this type of construction and personal guarantees are required.  
     Construction lending entails significant risks compared with residential mortgage lending.  These risks involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers with funds advanced upon the security of the land or the project under construction.  The value of the project is estimated prior to the completion of construction.  Thus, it is more difficult to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and related loan-to-value ratios.  If the estimate of construction or development cost proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property.  Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project proves to be inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment.  To mitigate these risks, in addition to the underwriting considerations noted above, we maintain an in-house construction monitoring unit that has oversight for the projects and we require both site visits and frequent reporting before funds are advanced.
     Residential Real Estate Lending
     We originate a variety of consumer-oriented residential real estate loans.  Residential mortgage loans consist primarily of first mortgage loans to individuals, most of which have a loan-to-value not exceeding 89.9%.  The remainder of this portion of our portfolio consists of home equity lines of credit and fixed rate home equity loans.  Our residential real estate loans are generally for owner-occupied single family homes.  These loans are generally for a primary residence although we will occasionally originate loans for a second home where the borrower has strong credit.  Our residential real estate loans are generally either fixed rate loans with thirty-year terms for conventional mortgages, ten-year terms for jumbo mortgages or five-, seven-, and 10-year adjustable rate mortgages with a 30-year amortization.
     Our home equity loans and home equity lines of credit are primarily secured by a second mortgage on owner-occupied one-to-four family residences.  Our home equity loans are originated at fixed or adjustable interest rates and with terms of between five and twenty years and are fully amortizing.  Our home equity lines allow for the borrower to draw against the line for ten years, after which the outstanding balance is amortized over twenty years.  Home equity lines of credit carry a variable rate of interest and are interest only during the draw period.  Home equity loans and lines of credit are generally underwritten with a maximum combined loan-to-value ratio of 80% although in some instances the combined loan-to-value ratio may reach 89.9%.  We require appraisals or valuations on all real estate loans – both commercial and residential.  At the time we close a home equity loan or line of credit, we record a mortgage to perfect our security interest in the underlying collateral.  Home equity loans and lines of credit greater than $50,000 also require title insurance, and borrowers must obtain hazard insurance, and flood insurance, if applicable.
     Home equity loans and lines of credit generally have greater risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.  In these cases, we face the risk that collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance.  In particular, because home equity loans are secured by second mortgages, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of the property serving as collateral for these loans.  Thus, the recovery of such property could be insufficient to compensate us for the value of these loans.
     Our home equity loan portfolio gives us a diverse client base.  Most of these loans are in our primary market area, and the diversity of the individual loans in the portfolio reduces our potential risk.
     Consumer Lending
     We offer various types of secured and unsecured consumer loans.  Generally, our consumer loans are made for personal, family or household purposes as a convenience to our customer base.  As a general guideline, a consumer’s total debt service should not exceed 43% of their gross income.  The underwriting standards for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and an assessment of his or her ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. 
     Consumer loans may present greater credit risk than residential real estate loans because many consumer loans are unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciating assets.  Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may 

 
  9

 
not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation.  Consumer loan collections also depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability.  If a borrower suffers personal financial difficulties, the loan may not be repaid.  Also, various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount we can recover on such loans.
     Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Participations and Servicing
     All loans that we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures, which incorporate standard underwriting guidelines.  We originate both fixed and variable rate loans.  Our loan origination activity may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment that typically results in decreased loan demand.  We occasionally sell participations in commercial loans to correspondent banks if the amount of the loan exceeds our internal limits.  More rarely, we purchase loan participations from correspondent banks in the local market as well.  Those loans are underwritten in-house with the same standards as loans directly originated.  Our residential real estate loans originated for resale are discussed under “Mortgage Banking Activities” below.     Loan Approval Procedures and Authority
     Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our board of directors.  The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan, and the adequacy of the value of the collateral that will secure the loan, if applicable.  To assess a business borrower’s ability to repay, we review and analyze, among other factors:  current income, credit history including the Bank’s prior experience with the borrower, cash flow, any secondary sources of repayment, other debt obligations in regards to the equity/net worth of the borrower and collateral available to the Bank to secure the loan.  
     We require appraisals or valuations of all real property securing one-to-four family residential and commercial real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit.  All appraisers are state licensed or state certified appraisers, and a list of approved appraisers is maintained and updated on an annual basis.
     Deposit Activities
     Deposits are the major source of our funding.  We offer a broad array of consumer and business deposit products that include demand, money market, and savings accounts, as well as time deposits.  We offer through key technology partnerships a competitive array of commercial cash management products, which allow us to attract demand deposits.  We believe that we pay competitive rates on our interest-bearing deposits.  As a relationship oriented organization, we generally seek to obtain deposit relationships with our loan clients.  
     We offer Certificate of Deposit Registry Service (“CDARS”) and Insured Cash Sweep (“ICS”) deposits to our customers.  These programs allow customers to deposit more than would normally be covered by FDIC insurance.  CDARS and ICS are nationwide programs that allow participating banks to “swap” customer deposits so that no customer has greater than the insurable maximum in one bank, while allowing the customer the convenience of maintaining a relationship with only one bank.
     Mortgage Banking Activities
     Until February 2018, we originated residential mortgage loans for resale in the secondary mortgage market through our mortgage division. We terminated this activity in contemplation of the proposed Merger. These loans were underwritten pursuant to standard underwriting guidelines.  While our intent was to sell all loans originated as loans held for sale, rarely, we were unable to sell a loan due to some underwriting defect.  These loans were transferred to the loan portfolio at the lower of their cost or fair value at the date of transfer.  Loans held for sale are sold with servicing rights released; gains or losses are recorded at the sale commitment date.

 Other Banking Products
     We offer our customers treasury services products that include wire transfer and ACH services, Check cards and automated teller machines at most of our full service branch locations, safe deposit boxes at some full service locations and credit cards through a third party processor.  In addition to traditional deposit services, we offer telephone banking services, mobile banking, internet banking services and internet bill paying services to our customers.  We also offer remote deposit capture to our commercial customers and mobile capture to our business and consumer customers.     EMPLOYEES
     At December 31, 2017, the Bank had 121 full-time and 10 part-time employees.  None of our employees are represented by a union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement.  Management considers its employee relations to be excellent.     SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
     General 
     The Company is a savings and loan holding company registered with the Federal Reserve under the Home Owners Loan Act of 1933, as amended (the “HOL Act”), and, as such, is subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the HOL Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve.  As a publicly traded company whose common stock is registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, the Company is also subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC (“NASDAQ”). 
     The Bank is supervised and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and is also subject to examination by the FDIC.  This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit insurance funds and depositors, and not for the protection of stockholders.  Under this system of federal regulation, financial institutions are periodically examined to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates.  The Bank also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the “FHLB”), which is one of the 12 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.  The Bank also is regulated to a lesser extent by the Federal Reserve, which governs reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters.  The OCC examines the Bank and prepares reports for the consideration of its board of directors on any operating deficiencies.  The Bank’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by federal law and, to a much lesser extent, state law, especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of the Bank’s loan documents.  In addition to the foregoing, there are a myriad of other federal and state laws and regulations that affect, impact or govern the business of banking, including consumer lending, deposit-taking, and trust operations.
     All non-bank subsidiaries of the Company are subject to examination by the Federal Reserve, and, as affiliates of the Bank, are subject to examination by the OCC and the FDIC.
     Any change in these laws by Congress or in these regulations by the Federal Reserve, the OCC or the FDIC could have a material adverse impact on the Company, the Bank and their operations. 
     Certain of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Bank and Company are described below.  This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Company and the Bank, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations.

             Dodd-Frank Act
     The Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in July 2010, significantly restructured the financial regulatory regime in the United States.  Although the Dodd-Frank Act’s provisions that have received the most public attention generally have been those applying to or more likely to affect larger institutions such as banks and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, it contains numerous other provisions that affect all financial institutions, including the Company and the Bank.  The Dodd-Frank Act contains a wide variety of provisions (many of which are not yet effective) affecting the regulation of savings and loan holding companies and depository institutions, including restrictions related to mortgage originations, risk retention requirements as to securitized loans, and the establishment of a financial consumer protection agency, known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), that is empowered to promulgate and enforce new consumer protection regulations and revise and enforce existing regulations in many areas of consumer compliance.  
     Moreover, not only are the states’ attorneys general entitled to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the CFPB, but states are permitted to adopt their own consumer protection laws that are more strict than those created under the Dodd-Frank Act.  Recently, U.S. financial regulatory agencies have increasingly used general consumer protection statutes to address unethical or otherwise bad business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law.  Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, there was little formal guidance as to the parameters for compliance with the federal “unfair or deceptive acts or practices” (“UDAP”) laws.  However, the UDAP provisions have been expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices”, which has been delegated to the CFPB for supervision.
     The legislation also broadens the base for FDIC insurance assessments.  Assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution.  The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2008.  Lastly, the Dodd-Frank Act will increase stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders the opportunity to approve or disapprove, by non-binding advisory votes, executive compensation and, in certain circumstances, so-called “golden parachute” payments.  The legislation also directs the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. 
     During 2013, significant media attention was given to the Dodd-Frank Act’s amendment of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHC Act”) to require the U.S. financial regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banking institutions and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds).  The statutory provision is commonly called the “Volcker Rule”.  The U.S. financial regulatory agencies adopted final rules implementing the Volcker Rule on December 10, 2013.  The Volcker Rule became effective on July 21, 2012 and the final rules initially had an effective date of April 1, 2015, but the U.S. financial regulatory agencies issued an order extending the period during which institutions have to conform their activities and investments to the requirements of the Volcker Rule to July 21, 2015.  On December 18, 2015, the Federal Reserve granted an additional one year extension to July 21, 2016, for certain “legacy covered fund” investments and relationships entered into by banking entities prior to December 31, 2013.  The Federal Reserve also indicated that it planned to grant an additional one year extension to July 21, 2017, at a later date.  We completed our evaluation of the impact of the Volcker Rule and the final rules adopted thereunder and determined that they will not have a material effect on our operations, as we believe that we do not engage in the businesses prohibited by the Volcker Rule.  We may incur costs related to the adoption of additional policies and systems to ensure compliance with the Volcker Rule, but we do not expect that such costs would be material.  
     Several of the Dodd-Frank Act’s provisions remain subject to final rulemaking by the U.S. financial regulatory agencies, and the Dodd-Frank Act’s impact on our business will depend to a large extent on how and when such rules are adopted and implemented by the primary U.S. financial regulatory agencies.  We continue to analyze the impact of rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act on our business, but the full impact will not be known until the rules and related 

 
  12

 
regulatory initiatives are finalized and their combined impact can be understood.  We do anticipate that the Dodd-Frank Act will increase our regulatory compliance burdens and costs and may restrict the financial products and services that we offer to our customers in the future.  In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act will require us to invest significant management attention and resources so that we can evaluate the impact of and ensure compliance with this law and its rules.
     Federal Banking Regulation 
     Business Activities 
     As an FSB, the Bank derives its lending and investment powers from the HOL Act and the regulations, pronouncements or guidance of the OCC.  Under these laws and regulations, the Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and nonresidential real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, certain types of securities and certain other loans and assets.  Specifically, the Bank may originate, invest in, sell, or purchase unlimited loans on the security of residential real estate, while loans on nonresidential real estate generally may not, on a combined basis, exceed 400% of the Bank’s total capital.  In addition, secured and unsecured commercial loans and certain types of commercial personal property leases may not exceed 20% of the Bank’s assets; however, amounts in excess of 10% of assets may only be used for small business loans.  Further, the Bank may generally invest up to 35% of its assets in consumer loans, corporate debt securities and commercial paper on a combined basis, and up to the greater of its capital or 5.0% of its assets in unsecured construction loans.  The Bank may invest up to 10% of its assets in tangible personal property, for rental or sale.  The Bank also may establish subsidiaries that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for the Bank directly, including real estate investment and insurance agency activities.  A violation of the lending and investment limitations may be subject to the same enforcement mechanisms of the primary federal regulator as other violations of a law or regulation.     Capital Requirements 
     Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards:  a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.  These capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Basel III Capital Rules”).
     In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset.  Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk.  Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings.  Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital.  Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries.  Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital.  Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt.  Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values.  Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.  In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the OCC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary.
     In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital 

 
  13

 
conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.  The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
     At December 31, 2017, the Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable regulatory requirements and the Bank was considered well capitalized. In addition at December 31, 2017, the Bank’s capital exceeded the capital conservation buffer requirements being phased at 1.25% and fully phased in 2.5%.
     Loans-to-One Borrower 
     Generally, an FSB may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus.  An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily determinable marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate.  At December 31, 2017, the Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one-borrower limitations.
     Qualified Thrift Lender Test 
     As an FSB, the Bank is subject to a qualified thrift lender (“QTL”) test.  Under the QTL test, the Bank must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period.  “Portfolio assets” generally means the total assets of a savings institution, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the FSB’s business.
     “Qualified thrift investments” include various types of loans made for residential and housing purposes, investments related to those purposes, including certain mortgage-backed and related securities, and loans for personal, family, household and certain other purposes up to a limit of 20% of portfolio assets.  “Qualified thrift investments” also include 100% of an institution’s credit card loans, education loans and small business loans.  The Bank also may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  At December 31, 2017, the Bank satisfied the QTL test.  An FSB that fails the QTL test must operate under specified restrictions, including limits on growth, branching, new investment and dividends.  As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, noncompliance with the QTL test is subject to regulatory enforcement action as a violation of law.
     Capital Distributions 
     OCC regulations govern capital distributions by an FSB, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the FSB’s capital account.  An FSB must file an application for approval of a capital distribution if: 
· | the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the FSB’s net income for that year to date plus the FSB’s retained net income for the preceding two years;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the FSB would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or OCC imposed condition; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the FSB is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

      Even if an application is not otherwise required, every FSB that is a subsidiary of a holding company must still file a notice with the OCC at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution. 
    
 
  14

 

 The OCC may disapprove an application or object to a notice of proposed distribution if: 
    
· | the FSB would be undercapitalized following the distribution;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1991 (the “FDI Act”) provides that an insured depository institution shall not make any capital distribution if the institution would be undercapitalized after making such distribution. 
     Liquidity
     An FSB is required to maintain a sufficient amount of liquid assets to ensure its safe and sound operation.  Historically, the regulation and monitoring of liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, without required formulaic measures.  The liquidity framework under the Basel III Capital Rules requires banks and their holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward would be required by regulation.  One test, referred to as the LCR, is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity’s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario.  The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one year time horizon.  These requirements will incent banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source.  In October 2013, the federal banking agencies proposed rules implementing the LCR for advanced approaches banking organizations and a modified version of the LCR for savings and loan holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets that are not advanced approach banking organizations, neither of which would apply to the Company or the Bank.       Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws
     All FSBs have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) and related regulations of the OCC to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low and moderate income borrowers.  In connection with its examination of an FSB, the OCC is required to assess the FSB’s record of compliance with the CRA.  In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes.  An FSB’s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities.  The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.  At December 31, 2017, the Bank’s CRA rating was “Outstanding.”  All FDIC-insured institutions are required to make available to the public their most recent CRA performance evaluation.      Transactions with Related Parties 
     An FSB’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by OCC regulations and by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing Regulation W promulgated by the Federal Reserve.  An affiliate is generally a company that controls  or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as the Bank.  The Company is an affiliate of the Bank.  In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative and collateral requirements.  In addition, OCC regulations prohibit an FSB from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary.  Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve low quality assets and be on terms that are at least as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates.  The OCC requires FSBs to maintain detailed records of all transactions with affiliates. 

 
  15

 

     The Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve.  Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders: 
    
(i) | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank’s capital.
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Bank’s board of directors. 
     Enforcement 
     The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over FSBs and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an FSB.  Formal enforcement action by the OCC may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order, to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution, and the appointment of a receiver or conservator.  Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million per day.  The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or to recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution.  If action is not taken by the OCC, the FDIC has authority to take action under specified circumstances. 
     Standards for Safety and Soundness 
     Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions.  These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate.  Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired.  If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.  If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan.  Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties. 
     Prompt Corrective Action Regulations
     Under the Federal Prompt Corrective Action statute, the OCC is required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings institutions under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s level of capital.  The previously mentioned final capital rule effective January 1, 2015 revised the prompt corrective action categories to incorporate the revised minimum capital requirements, effective the same date.  See the discussion above under the heading, “Capital Requirements.”
     Under the revised categories, a savings institution that has total risk-based capital of less than 8%, a leverage ratio that is less than 4%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5% is considered to be undercapitalized.  A savings institution that has total risk-based capital less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, a leverage ratio that is less than 3%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less 

 
  16

 
than 3% is considered to be “significantly undercapitalized.”  A savings institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2% is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized."
     Generally, the banking regulator is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for an FSB that is “critically undercapitalized.”  The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a bank receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.”  A parent holding company for the institution involved must guarantee performance under the capital restoration plan up to the lesser of the institution’s capital deficiency when deemed undercapitalized or 5% of the institution’s assets.  In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to the FSB, including, but not limited to, restrictions on growth, investment activities, capital distributions and affiliate transactions.  The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized FSBs, including the issuance of a capital directive and individual minimum capital requirements and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.
     At December 31, 2017, the Bank met the criteria for being considered “well-capitalized”.
     Insurance of Deposit Accounts 
     The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2008. 
     Effective April 1, 2011, the FDIC implemented a requirement of the Dodd-Frank Act to revise its assessment system to base it on each institution’s total assets less tangible capital instead of deposits.  The FDIC also revised its assessment schedule so that it ranges from 2.5 basis points for the least risky institutions to 45 basis points for the riskiest. 
     Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or regulatory condition imposed in writing.  We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance. 
     Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements 
     FSBs are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.      Federal Home Loan Bank System 
     The Bank is a member of the FHLB, which is one of 12 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.  The FHLB System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending.  The Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock of the FHLB as a condition of membership.  At December 31, 2017, the Bank was in compliance with this requirement.     Bank Secrecy Act
     Under the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), a financial institution is required to have systems in place to detect certain transactions, based on the size and nature of the transaction.  Financial institutions are generally required to report cash transactions in excess of $10,000 to the United States Treasury.  In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for transactions in excess of $5,000 and which the financial institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA, or has no lawful purpose.  The USA Patriot Act enacted prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence standards intended to prevent the use of the United States financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities.  The USA Patriot Act requires banks and other depository institutions, brokers, dealers 

 
  17

 
and certain other businesses involved in the transfer of money to establish anti-money laundering programs, including employee training and independent audit requirements meeting minimum standards specified by the act, to follow standards for customer identification and maintenance of customer identification records, and to compare customer lists against lists of suspected terrorists, terrorist organizations and money launderers.  The USA Patriot Act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition.
     Supervision and Regulation of Mortgage Banking Operations
     Our mortgage banking business is subject to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), the Veterans' Administration (“VA”), and Fannie Mae with respect to originating, processing, selling and servicing mortgage loans.  Those rules and regulations, among other things, prohibit discrimination and establish underwriting guidelines, which include provisions for inspections and appraisals, require credit reports on prospective borrowers, and fix maximum loan amounts.  Lenders such as us are required annually to submit audited financial statements to Fannie Mae, FHA and VA.  Each of these regulatory entities has its own financial requirements.  We are also subject to examination by the Federal Reserve, Fannie Mae, FHA and VA at all times to assure compliance with the applicable regulations, policies and procedures.  Mortgage origination activities are subject to, among others, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, Fair Housing Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, the National Flood Insurance Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and related regulations that prohibit discrimination and require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit terms and settlement costs.  Our mortgage banking operations also are affected by various state and local laws and regulations and the requirements of various private mortgage investors.
     In January 2013, the CFPB issued eight final regulations governing mainly consumer mortgage lending.  These regulations became effective in January 2014.
     One of these rules, effective on January 10, 2014, requires mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms.  This rule also defines “qualified mortgages.”  In general, a “qualified mortgage” is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or a term exceeding 30 years, where the lender determines that the borrower has the ability to repay, and where the borrower’s points and fees do not exceed 3% of the total loan amount.  Qualified mortgages that that are not “higher-priced” are afforded a safe harbor presumption of compliance with the ability to repay rules.  Qualified mortgages that are “higher-priced” garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability to repay rules.
     The CFPB regulations also:  (i)  require that “higher-priced” mortgages must have escrow accounts for taxes and insurance and similar recurring expenses; (ii)  expand the scope of the high-rate, high-cost mortgage provisions by, among other provisions, lowering the rates and fees that lead to coverage and including home equity lines of credit; (iii)  revise rules for mortgage loan originator compensation; (iv)  add prohibitions against mandatory arbitration provisions and financing single premium credit insurances; and (v)  impose a broader requirement for providing borrowers with copies of all appraisals on first-lien dwelling secured loans.
     Effective January 10, 2014, the CFPB’s final Truth-in-Lending Act rules relating to mortgage servicing impose new obligations to credit payments and provide payoff statements within certain time periods and provide new notices prior to interest rate and payment adjustments.  Effective on that same date, the CFPB’s final Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act rules add new obligations on the servicer when a mortgage loan is in default.
     On November 20, 2013, the CFPB issued a final rule on integrated mortgage disclosures under the Truth-in-Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, for which compliance was required by October 3, 2015.  At December 31, 2017, we are in compliance with these integrated mortgage disclosure rules.

 Supervision and Regulation of Mortgage Brokerage Operations
     Our mortgage brokerage operation is governed by a host of federal laws and regulations.  For example, mortgage brokers must comply with: the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the “GLB Act”) and the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”), as well as fair lending and fair housing laws.  Many of these statutes, coupled with their implementing regulations, provide substantive protection to borrowers who seek mortgage financing.  These laws impose disclosure requirements on brokers, define high-cost loans, and contain anti-discrimination provisions.  
     Additionally, mortgage brokers are under the oversight of HUD and the FTC Act; and to the extent their promulgated laws apply to mortgage brokers, the Federal Reserve Board, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Department of Labor.  These agencies ensure that mortgage brokers comply with the aforementioned federal laws, along with the disclosure and reporting requirements associated with advertising, marketing and compensation for services.
     Consumer Lending – Military Lending Act
     The Military Lending Act (the “MLA”), which was initially implemented in 2007, was amended and its coverage significantly expanded in 2015.  The Department of Defense issued a final rule under the MLA that took effect on October 15, 2015, but financial institutions were not required to take action until October 3, 2016.  The types of credit covered under the MLA were expanded to include virtually all consumer loan and credit card products (except for loans secured by residential real property and certain purchase-money motor vehicle/personal property secured transactions).  Lenders must now provide specific written and oral disclosures concerning the protections of the MLA to active duty members of the military and dependents of active duty members of the military (“covered borrowers”).  The rule imposes a 36% “Military Annual Percentage Rate” cap that includes costs associated with credit insurance premiums, fees for ancillary products, finance charges associated with the transactions, and application and participation charges.  In addition, loan terms cannot include (i) a mandatory arbitration provision, (ii) a waiver of consumer protection laws, (iii) mandatory allotments from military benefits, or (iv) a prepayment penalty.  The revised rule also prohibits “roll-over” or refinances of the same loan unless the new loan provides more favorable terms for the covered borrower.  Lenders may verify covered borrower status using a DOD database or information provided by credit bureaus.  We believe that we are in compliance with the revised rule.     Other Regulations 
     Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates.  The Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 
· | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Truth in Savings Act; and
--+--------------------------

     
 
  19

 


· | Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The operations of the Bank also are subject to the: 
    
· | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, commonly referred to as the "USA Patriot Act", which requires FSBs to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs, and due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements that also apply to financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The GLB Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the GLB Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.

          Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation 
     General 
     The Company is a non-diversified savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the HOL Act.  As such, the Company is registered with the Federal Reserve and is subject to Federal Reserve regulations, examinations and reporting requirements.  In addition, the Federal Reserve has enforcement authority over the Company and its non-insured subsidiaries.  Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution.      Permissible Activities 
     Under present law, the business activities of the Company are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the BHC Act or for multiple savings and loan holding companies.  A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity.  A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act, subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve, and certain additional activities authorized by Federal Reserve regulations. 
     Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including the Company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve.  It also prohibits the acquisition or retention of, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a nonsubsidiary company engaged in activities that are not closely related to 

 
  20

 
banking or financial in nature, or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured.  In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve must consider the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. 
     The Federal Reserve is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions: 
    
(i) | the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition.
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions. 
     Capital 
     Savings and loan holding companies have not historically been subject to specific regulatory capital requirements.  The Dodd-Frank Act, however, required the Federal Reserve to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to their subsidiary depository institutions.  Instruments such as cumulative preferred stock and trust-preferred securities, which were previously includable within Tier 1 capital by bank holding companies, within certain limits, would no longer be includable as Tier 1 capital, subject to certain grandfathering.  The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implements the Dodd-Frank Act as to savings and loan holding companies.  Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary depository institutions applied to savings and loan holding companies at January 1, 2015.  As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer will be phased in between 2016 and 2019.        Dividends 
     The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies that it has made applicable to savings and loan holding companies as well.  In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.  Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund a dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition.  The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized.  These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions and stock repurchases.
     Source of Strength Doctrine
     The “source of strength doctrine” requires bank holding companies to provide financial assistance to their subsidiary depository institutions in the event the subsidiary depository institution experiences financial distress.  The Dodd-Frank Act extends the source of strength doctrine to savings and loan holding companies.  The Federal Reserve has issued regulations requiring that all bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial distress.
