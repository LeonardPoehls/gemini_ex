Item 1. | Business.

Overview
We are a global business that develops, manufactures, markets and distributes specialty pharmaceutical products and therapies. Areas of focus include autoimmune and rare diseases in specialty areas like neurology, rheumatology, nephrology, pulmonology and ophthalmology; immunotherapy and neonatal respiratory critical care therapies; analgesics and gastrointestinal products. 
In the past few years, we have executed on Mallinckrodt’s ongoing transformation to become an innovation-driven specialty pharmaceuticals growth company through a series of strategic acquisitions and divestitures, developing strong commercial platforms and an increasingly robust pipeline. In doing so, our emphasis has evolved to focus on a development portfolio of treatments for severe and critically ill infants and adults.
Through December 29, 2017, we operated our business in two reportable segments, which are further described below:

• | Specialty Brands includes branded medicines; and


• | Specialty Generics includes specialty generic drugs, active pharmaceutical ingredients ("APIs") and external manufacturing.

We completed the sale of our Nuclear Imaging ("Nuclear") business and our contrast media and delivery systems ("CMDS") business on January 27, 2017 and November 27, 2015, respectively. As a result, prior year balances have been recast to present the financial results of these businesses as discontinued operations. 
In January 2018, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our RECOTHROM® Thrombin topical (Recombinant) ("Recothrom") and PreveLeak™ Surgical Sealant ("PreveLeak") assets to Baxter International, Inc.  In February 2018, we acquired Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., including AMITIZA® (lubiprostone), a leading global product in the branded gastrointestinal market.
To further execute upon our strategic vision, on February 22, 2018, our Board of Directors provided authorization to dispose of three areas of our business, which are referred to collectively as "the Specialty Generics Disposal Group" and include the following: (1) Our Specialty Generics business comprised of our Specialty Generics segment, with the exception of our external manufacturing operations; (2) certain of our non-promoted brands business, which is currently reflected in our Specialty Brands segment; and (3) our ongoing, post-divestiture supply agreement with the acquirer of the CMDS business, which is currently reflected in our Other non-operating segment. Given our shift in focus to patients with severe and critical conditions, the areas within the Specialty Generics Disposal Group no longer align with our strategic vision, as such, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the historical financial results attributable to the Specialty Generics Disposal Group will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations.
For further information on our products and segments, refer to "Our Businesses and Product Strategies" within this Item 1. Business.
Fiscal Year
We historically reported our results based on a "52-53 week" year ending on the last Friday of September. On May 17, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a change in our fiscal year end to the last Friday in December from the last Friday in September. The change in fiscal year became effective for our 2017 fiscal year, which began on December 31, 2016 and ended on December 29, 2017. As a result of the change in fiscal year end, we filed a Transition Report on Form 10-Q on February 7, 2017 covering the period from October 1, 2016 through December 30, 2016 ("the three months ended December 30, 2016") with the comparable period from September 26, 2015 through December 25, 2015 ("the three months ended December 25, 2015"). Fiscal 2016 covers the period from September 26, 2015 through September 30, 2016.

History and Development
Our development can be traced to the founding of G. Mallinckrodt & Co. in 1867 (predecessor of today's API business). Over the past 150 years, Mallinckrodt has grown to become a global leader in specialty pharmaceuticals on a quest to improve the lives of patients around the world.
Mallinckrodt plc was incorporated in Ireland on January 9, 2013 for the purpose of holding the pharmaceuticals business of Covidien plc ("Covidien"). On June 28, 2013, Covidien shareholders of record received one ordinary share of Mallinckrodt for every eight ordinary shares of Covidien held as of the record date, June 19, 2013, and the pharmaceuticals business of Covidien was transferred to Mallinckrodt plc, thereby completing our legal separation from Covidien ("the Separation"). 
In May 2015, our Board of Directors approved the migration of our principal executive offices to the United Kingdom ("U.K."), which is located at Three Lotus Park, The Causeway, Staines-upon-Thames, Surrey, TW18 3 AG. In addition, we have other locations in the United States ("U.S."), most notably our corporate shared services office in Hazelwood, Missouri, our Specialty Brands commercial headquarters in Bedminster, New Jersey and our Specialty Generics headquarters and technical development center in Webster Groves, Missouri.
Our Strategic Vision
Our Mission: Managing complexity. Improving lives. With this as our guide, our strategic vision is clear:
While we have set forth our strategic vision above, our business involves numerous risks and uncertainties which may prevent us from executing our strategies. For a more complete description of the risks associated with our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Businesses and Products
Through December 29, 2017 and [prior to the announcement of our plan to divest the Specialty Generics Disposal Group] we managed our business in two reportable segments: Specialty Brands and Specialty Generics. Management measures and evaluates our operating segments based on segment net sales and operating income. Information regarding the product portfolios and business strategies of these segments is included in the following discussion. Financial information regarding each of our reportable segments, as well as other geographical information, is included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Specialty Brands 
Our Specialty Brands segment markets branded pharmaceutical products for autoimmune and rare disease in the specialty areas of neurology, rheumatology, nephrology, ophthalmology and pulmonology; immunotherapy and neonatal respiratory critical care therapies, analgesics and gastrointestinal products. Our diversified, in-line portfolio of both marketed and development products is focused on patients with significant unmet medical needs. In the past few years, we have significantly expanded our Specialty Brands portfolio through our business development and licensing transactions as detailed below:
Product | Transaction Date | Product Status
Ofirmev® | March 2014 | Marketed 
H.P. Acthar® Gel | August 2014 | Marketed 
Inomax® | April 2015 | Marketed 
Therakos® | September 2015 | Marketed 
StrataGraft® | August 2016 | In development
Stannsoporfin | September 2017 | In development
Xenon gas for inhalation | October 2017 | In development
MNK-6105 (previously OCR-002) | December 2017 | In development
Amitiza® (1) | February 2018 | Marketed 
VTS-270 (1) | February 2018 | In development
CPP-1X/sulindac (1) | February 2018 | In development

(1) These products did not have any impact to fiscal 2017 results. Refer to Item 7. MD&A of Financial Conditions for discussion around the acquisition of these products in February 2018.
In addition to the products listed above, in fiscal 2016, we acquired Recothrom, PreveLeak and RAPLIXA™ (Fibrin Sealant (Human)) ("Raplixa") from The Medicines Company ("Hemostasis", "the Hemostasis Acquisition"). As our emphasis has evolved to focus on a development portfolio of treatments for seriously ill infants and adults, these products are now less strategic for us, and in January 2018 we announced plans to divest the products, which is covered in more detail below. We expect the sale of these products to close in the first quarter of 2018.
Our long-term strategy is to increase patient access and appropriate utilization of our existing products, develop new and follow-on formulations for recently acquired products, advance pipeline products and bring them to market and selectively acquire or license products that are strategically aligned with our product portfolio to expand the size and profitability of our Specialty Brands segment. 
We promote our branded products directly to physicians in their offices, hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers (including neurologists, rheumatologists, nephrologists, ophthalmologists, pulmonologists, neonatologists, surgeons, and pharmacy directors) with our own direct sales force of over 500 sales representatives as of December 29, 2017. Our products are purchased by independent wholesale drug distributors, specialty pharmaceutical distributors, retail pharmacy chains and hospital procurement departments, among others, and are eventually dispensed by prescription to patients. We also contract directly with payer organizations to ensure reimbursement for our products to patients that are prescribed our products by their physicians. 
The following is a description of select products in our Specialty Brands product portfolio:

• | H.P. Acthar® Gel ("H.P. Acthar Gel") is an injectable drug approved by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration ("FDA") for use in 19 indications. The product currently generates substantially all of its net sales from ten of the on-label indications, including the treatment of proteinuria in nephrotic syndrome of the idiopathic type ("NS"); the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis ("MS") in adults; the treatment of infantile spasms ("IS") in infants and children under two years of age; the treatment of the pulmonology indication of sarcoidosis; the treatment of ophthalmic conditions related to severe acute and chronic allergic and inflammatory processes; and the treatment of certain rheumatology-related conditions, including the treatment of the rare and closely related neuromuscular disorders, dermatomyositis and polymyositis. We may initiate commercial efforts for other approved indications where there is high unmet medical need. The currently approved indications of H.P. Acthar Gel are not subject to patent or other exclusivity, with the exception of IS which was granted orphan drug status from the FDA upon its approval in October 2010. 

Since acquiring H.P. Acthar Gel, we have initiated critical controlled trials in an effort to expand the product's evidence base and strengthen its clinical profile. For example, we are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 2 study to evaluate H.P. Acthar Gel for patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ("ALS") a progressive and fatal 
6

neurodegenerative disorder. In addition, we continue our efforts to extend the value of the product through Phase 4 studies and product enhancements.

• | Inomax® ("Inomax") is a vasodilator that, in conjunction with ventilatory support and other appropriate agents, is indicated to improve oxygenation and reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in term and near-term (>34 weeks) neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure ("HRF") associated with clinical or echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Inomax is marketed as part of the Inomax Total Care Package, which includes the drug product, proprietary drug-delivery systems, technical and clinical assistance, 24/7/365 customer service, emergency supply and delivery and on-site training. The Inomax Total Care Package maintains a number of patents, the latest of which expire in 2034, that contain claims to nitric oxide delivery systems expressly required by the drug labeling for administration of Inomax, covering a number of important functions, including patient safety and product performance features. There has been recent patent litigation related to the Inomax product, as further described in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


• | Ofirmev® ("Ofirmev") is a proprietary intravenous formulation of acetaminophen indicated for the management of mild to moderate pain, the management of moderate to severe pain with adjunctive opioid analgesics and the reduction of fever. This product is marketed to hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers and provides us with an expanded presence in these channels. Ofirmev is protected by two patents listed in the Orange Book: Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence ("the Orange Book"), one of which expired in August 2017 and the other will expire in June 2021. We have the potential to obtain an additional six months of exclusivity for each patent if the FDA grants pediatric exclusivity. Settlement agreements have been reached in association with certain challenges to these patents, which allow for generic competition to Ofirmev in December 2020, or earlier under certain circumstances. 


• | Therakos® ("Therakos") is focused on providing innovative immunotherapy treatment platforms that enhance the ability of a patient's immune system to fight disease. Therakos is the global leader in autologous immunotherapy delivered through extracorporeal photopheresis ("ECP") and provides the only integrated ECP system in the world. ECP involves drawing blood from the patient, separating white blood cells from plasma and red blood cells, which are returned to the patient, and treating the white blood cells with an Ultraviolet-A ("UVA") light activated drug. The treated white blood cells are immediately re-administered back into the patient. ECP is approved by the FDA for use in the palliative treatment of the skin manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (“CTCL”) that is unresponsive to other forms of treatment. Outside the U.S., ECP is approved to treat several other serious diseases that arise from immune system imbalances. Therakos’ product suite, which is sold to hospitals, clinics, academic centers and blood banks, includes an installed system, a disposable procedural kit used for each treatment and a drug, UVADEX ® (methoxsalen) Sterile Solution (“UVADEX”), as well as instrument accessories and instrument maintenance and repair services.


• | Amitiza® ("Amitiza") is a leading global product in the branded constipation market. Amitiza is approved by the FDA for treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation in women 18 years of age and older, and opioid-induced constipation in adult patients with chronic, non-cancer pain, including patients with chronic pain related to prior cancer or its treatment who do not require frequent opioid dosage escalation. Amitiza is a chloride channel activator which increases fluid secretion and motility of the intestine, facilitating passage of stool. Roughly 40 million patients in the U.S. suffer from some form of chronic constipation. Of the branded products currently marketed, only Amitiza is approved for three constipation indications in the U.S. The FDA is currently reviewing a supplemental New Drug Application ("NDA") for Amitiza in children 6 to 17 years of age with pediatric functional constipation ("PFC"). The supplemental NDA received a Priority Review designation and has a user fee goal date of April 28, 2018. If approved, Amitiza would be the first and only approved prescription therapy available to treat children with PFC. 


• | Pipeline products - we have multiple products in various stages of development, which we believe will provide long-term organic growth and diversification. The status of each of these products is shown below. For a more detailed description of these pipeline products, refer to the Research and Development ("R&D") section in this Item 1. Business.

 Specialty Generics
Our Specialty Generics segment markets drugs that include a variety of product formulations containing hydrocodone, oxycodone and several other controlled substances. While our near-term pipeline in this segment is limited, we do have products in development longer-term. Within this segment, we provide bulk API products, including opioids and acetaminophen, to a wide variety of pharmaceutical companies, many of which are direct competitors of our Specialty Generics finished dosage business. In addition, we use our API for internal manufacturing of our finished dosage products. In fiscal 2017, our Specialty Generics segment accounted for 26.5% of net sales from our reportable segments. 
We are among the world's largest manufacturers of bulk acetaminophen and the only producer of acetaminophen outside of Asia. We manufacture controlled substances under DEA quota restrictions and in calendar 2017 we estimated that we received approximately 36% of the total DEA quota provided to the U.S. market for the controlled substances we manufacture. We believe that our market position in the API business and allocation of opioid raw materials from the DEA is a competitive advantage for our API business and, in turn, for our Specialty Generics business. The strategy for our API business is based on manufacturing large volumes of high-quality product and customized product offerings, responsive technical services and timely delivery to our customers.
We market our products principally through independent channels, including drug distributors, specialty pharmaceutical distributors, retail pharmacy chains, food store chains with pharmacies, pharmaceutical benefit managers that have mail order pharmacies and hospital buying groups.
The following is a list of significant products and product families in our Specialty Generics product portfolio:

• | hydrocodone (API) and hydrocodone-containing tablets;


• | oxycodone (API) and oxycodone-containing tablets;


• | methylphenidate HCl extended-release tablets USP (CII) ("Methylphenidate ER") under a class BX-rating issued by the FDA in November 2014 and;


• | other controlled substances, including acetaminophen (API) products.

Research and Development
We devote significant resources to the research and development ("R&D") of products and proprietary drug technologies. We incurred R&D expenses from continuing operations of $277.3 million, $262.2 million, $203.3 million and $66.2 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 and the three months ended December 30, 2016, respectively. We expect to continue to invest in R&D activities, both for existing products and the development of new portfolio assets. We intend to focus our R&D investments principally in the 
8

specialty pharmaceuticals areas, specifically investments to support our Specialty Brands, where we believe there is the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. 
Specialty Brands. We devote significant R&D resources to our branded products. Our R&D investments center on building a diverse, durable portfolio of innovative therapies that provide value to patients, physicians and payers. Our strategy focuses on growth and pipeline opportunities related to early and late stage development products to meet the needs of underserved patient populations. Under our strategy we continue the development process and perform clinical trials to support FDA approval of new products. 
Data generation is an important strategic driver for our key products in development as they extend evidence in approved uses, label enhancements and new indications. Our strategy is realized through investments in both clinical and health economic activities. We are committed to supporting research that helps advance the understanding and treatment of a variety of different disease states that will further the understanding and development of our currently marketed products, including H.P. Acthar Gel, Inomax, Ofirmev and Therakos.
The most significant development products in our pipeline are:

• | Terlipressin is being investigated for the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome ("HRS") type 1, an acute, rare and life-threatening condition requiring hospitalization, with no currently approved therapy in the U.S. or Canada. In July 2017, we announced the enrollment of the 75th subject in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of terlipressin (for injection) in subjects with HRS type 1. This marked the achievement of one quarter of our target enrollment for this trial and we continue to make progress on this clinical study. 


• | StrataGraft is an investigational product in Phase 3 development for treatment of severe, deep partial thickness burns and Phase 2 development for treatment of severe, full thickness burns. In 2012, the FDA granted StrataGraft orphan product status, and the product is being developed as a biologic to be filed under a biologic license application that would confer regulatory protection until 2032. In June 2017, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in our Phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of StrataGraft regenerative skin tissue in the promotion of autologous skin regeneration of complex skin defects due to thermal burns that contain intact dermal elements. In July 2017, we announced that StrataGraft is among the first products to be designated as a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy ("RMAT") by the FDA under the provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act. The RMAT designation allows for earlier and increased interactions with the FDA, including discussions of whether priority review and/or accelerated approval would be appropriate based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints that would be reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit; or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Building upon the science of StrataGraft, we also maintain ExpressGraft-C9T1 skin tissue, a biologically-active skin tissue with a fully stratified epithelial compartment comprised of human keratinocytes and a dermal compartment containing fibroblasts. This tissue has been genetically modified to up-regulate production of a naturally occurring antimicrobial. It is being evaluated in a first-in-human prospective, open-label trial focused on assessing the safety and tolerability in the treatment of patients with diabetic foot ulcers, a type of wound that is often difficult to heal.


• | MNK-1411 (the product formerly described as Synacthen Depot®) is a depot formulation of Synacthen (tetracosactide), a synthetic 24 amino acid melanocortin receptor agonist. In August 2016, we announced that the FDA granted our request for fast track designation for its Investigational New Drug ("IND") application for MNK-1411 in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy ("DMD"). The FDA's fast track designation is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need. Then in fiscal 2017, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to MNK-1411 for the treatment of DMD. The Phase 1 study for MNK-1411 in healthy volunteers has been completed and the information derived was used to determine optimal dosing in our Phase 2 trial, which is expected to commence in 2018.


• | Stannsoporfin, a heme oxygenase inhibitor, is under investigation for its potential to reduce the production of bilirubin. If approved, stannsoporfin is expected to be a highly effective therapy used for near- and full-term infants at risk of developing complications associated with severe jaundice. This new treatment option may reduce the number of newborns advancing to bilirubin levels requiring more intrusive, less specific therapies, most often blood exchange transfusion and less frequently intravenous immunoglobululin infusions, both of which have a more complex and lengthy administration than stannsoporfin's single injection. Stannsoporfin, if approved, may also decrease the risks associated with other treatments (i.e., bilirubin rebound) and the risk of prolonged and/or severe bilirubin elevation, which can impact central nervous system development. In December 2016, stannsoporfin was granted fast track designation by the FDA and a NDA has been submitted.


• | Xenon gas for inhalation is a noble gas that has been used safely as an inhaled therapy in several studies to date. Following cardiac arrest, calcium channels in the brain can get over-activated, causing neuronal damage and cell death. When inhaled, xenon binds to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors through a unique glycine-binding mechanism and can help regulate the flow of ions through the calcium channels. By mitigating neuronal damage and cell death following a cardiac arrest, inhaled xenon may be able to reduce time in coma, lower mortality rates and improve cognitive and motor functions. The Phase 3 trial will be conducted under an FDA Special Protocol Agreement and is currently expected to begin in early 2018.

• | MNK-6105, an ammonia scavenger, is being studied for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy ("HE"), a neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with hyperammonemia, a complication of acute or chronic liver disease. If approved, MNK-6105 is expected to be an effective therapy that rapidly eliminates ammonia in the bloodstream, excreting it through the kidneys, a more effective and less burdensome method of addressing HE than existing treatment options. The intravenous ("IV") formulation of MNK-6105, if approved, is expected to provide rapid reduction in symptoms of acute HE, and potentially reduce hospitalization stay. MNK-6105's oral formulation, if approved, is expected to provide post-discharge continuity of care for the HE patient, reducing the risk of recurrent HE episodes and rehospitalization. It is also anticipated that patients may transition from the IV to the oral formulation prior to discharge from the hospital setting. The FDA and European Medicines Agency ("EMA") have granted orphan drug designation to MNK-6105. The FDA also granted fast track designation to MNK-6105.


• | VTS-270 is in Phase 3 development for Niemann-Pick Type C ("NPC"). NPC is a rare, neurodegenerative, and ultimately fatal disease that can present at any age. NPC is caused by mutations in either the NPC1 or NPC2 genes, resulting in the disruption of the trafficking of intracellular cholesterol, leading to intracellular lipid accumulation in various tissues, including the brain, liver, and spleen. NPC presents with neurologic and visceral features that overlap with other diseases often leading to a missed or delayed diagnosis. Neurodegenerative presentation in NPC is a major driver of morbidity and mortality. There are four main types of the disease – types A, B, C1 and C2; NPC encompasses types C1 and C2, which causes accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in cells, resulting in severe neurological, systemic or psychiatric disorders. Manifestations of the genetic disorder typically occur in childhood with occasional late onset. NPC is usually fatal, and the majority of cases lead to death. The FDA granted VTS-270 its orphan drug designation, and the resulting seven years exclusivity would be applied upon approval of the drug. The EMA also granted VTS-270 orphan drug status. In addition, the FDA granted the compound its Breakthrough Designation, indicating the drug is (1) intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition alone or combined with one or more other drugs, and (2) preliminary clinical evidence indicates it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The Breakthrough Designation status results in expedited review by the agency.


• | CPP-1X/sulindac is in Phase 3 development for Familial Adenomatous Polyposis ("FAP") under a collaborative agreement with Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals and Sucampo. FAP results from a genetic mutation leading to uncontrolled growth of hundreds to thousands of polyps in the lower digestive tract. Left untreated, there is a high liklihood of developing colorectal cancer. The disease typically progresses without clear warning signs until reaching advanced stages. It can also lead to abnormal manifestations in other organs including bone, skin, retina, teeth and other malignant lesions. The FDA granted CPP-1X/sulindac its orphan drug designation, as well as its Fast Track designation, a process designed to facilitate development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. Orphan drug status was also granted to the therapy by the EMA. CPP-1X/sulindac, if approved, will target the underlying disease mechanism, preventing polyp growth and delaying disease progression.

Specialty Generics. Specialty Generics development is focused on hard-to-manufacture pharmaceuticals with difficult-to-replicate pharmacokinetic profiles. Our Specialty Generics pipeline consists of a number of products in various stages of development. We currently perform most of our development work at our Specialty Generics headquarters and technical development center in Webster Groves, Missouri.
Competition
Several of our Specialty Brands products do not face direct competition from similar products, but instead compete against alternative forms of treatment that a prescriber may utilize. For example, H.P. Acthar Gel has limited direct competition due to the unique nature of the product; however, it generally is prescribed by physicians when numerous alternative treatments have failed to provide positive outcomes or are not well tolerated by the patient. Similarly, Inomax is the only inhaled nitric oxide product approved by the FDA that is indicated for the treatment of term and near-term (>34 weeks) neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with clinical or echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension, where it improves oxygenation and reduces the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our branded products offer not only superior health outcomes but also cost advantages, as compared with other forms of care.
The highly competitive environment of our Specialty Brands segment requires us to continually seek out new products to treat diseases and conditions in areas of high unmet medical needs, to create technological innovations and to market our products effectively. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market, as well as other products that are subsequently developed by competitors. For our branded products, we may be granted market exclusivity either through the FDA, the U.S. Patent Office or similar agencies internationally. Regulatory exclusivity is granted by the FDA for new innovations, such as new clinical data, a new chemical entity or orphan drugs, and patents are issued for inventions, such as composition of matter or method of use. While patents offer a longer period of exclusivity, there are more bases to challenge patent-conferred exclusivity 
10

than with regulatory exclusivity. Generally, once market exclusivity expires on our branded products, competition will likely intensify as generic forms of the product are launched. Products which do not benefit from regulatory or patent exclusivity must rely on other competitive advantages, such as confidentiality agreements or product formulation trade secrets for difficult to replicate products. Several of the products in our Specialty Brands product portfolio benefit from these forms of regulatory and patent-conferred exclusivity.
Manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals typically invest far less in R&D than research-based pharmaceutical companies, allowing generic versions to typically be significantly less expensive than the related branded products. The generic form of a drug may also enjoy a preferred position relative to the branded version under third-party reimbursement programs, or be routinely dispensed in substitution for the branded form by pharmacies. If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions, decreased sales volume or both. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our branded products offer not only superior health outcomes but also cost advantages, as compared with other forms of care. Certain of our Specialty Brands products are targeted for niche patient populations with unmet medical needs, for example H.P. Acthar Gel, that may not be prescribed unless a clear benefit in efficacy or safety is demonstrated or until alternatives have failed to provide positive patient outcomes or are not well tolerated by the patient. 
Our Specialty Generics products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets, primarily throughout the U.S. Our competitors vary depending upon therapeutic and product categories. Major competitors of our Specialty Generics products include Endo Health Solutions Inc., Johnson Matthey plc, Mylan N.V., Pfizer Inc., Purdue Pharma L.P. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., among others. We believe our secure sources of raw opioid material, vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities, broad offerings of API controlled substances and acetaminophen, comprehensive generic controlled substance product line and established relationships with pharmacies enable us to compete with larger generics manufacturers. In addition, we believe that our experience with the FDA, DEA and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies ("REMS") provides us the knowledge to operate in this highly competitive and regulated environment.
The Specialty Generics segment faces intense competition from other generic drug manufacturers, brand-name pharmaceutical companies marketing authorized generics, existing branded equivalents and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs. The competition varies depending on the specific product category and dosage strength. Among the large generic controlled substance providers, we are the only generic manufacturer that has its own controlled substance API manufacturing capability. New drugs and future developments in improved or advanced drug delivery technologies or other therapeutic techniques may provide therapeutic or cost advantages to products we market. The maintenance of profitable operations in generic pharmaceuticals depends, in part, on our ability to select, develop and timely launch new generic products, as well as our ability to manufacture such new products in a cost efficient, high-quality manner and implement and drive market volume. 
As a result of consolidation among wholesale distributors and rapid growth of large retail drug store chains, a small number of large wholesale distributors and retail drug store chains control a significant share of the market, and the number of independent drug stores and small drug store chains has decreased. This has resulted in customers gaining more purchasing power. Consequently, there is heightened competition among generic drug producers for the business of this smaller and more selective customer base.
In our API business, we believe that our competitive advantages include our manufacturing capabilities in controlled substances that enable high-speed, high-volume tableting, packaging and distribution. Additionally, we believe we offer customers reliability of supply and broad-based technical customer service.
The competitive landscape in the acquisition and in-licensing of pharmaceutical products has intensified in recent years, reflecting both a reduction in the number of compounds available and an increase in the number of companies and the collective resources bidding on available assets. The ability to effectively compete in product development, acquisitions and in-licensing is important to our long-term growth strategy. In addition to product development and acquisitions, other competitive factors in the pharmaceutical industry include product efficacy, safety, ease of use, price, demonstrated cost-effectiveness, third-party reimbursement, marketing effectiveness, customer service, reliability of supply, reputation and access to technical information.
Our current or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of the competition described above and the factors described in "Intellectual Property" included within this Item 1. Business, as well as any of the risk factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Intellectual Property
We own or license a number of patents in the U.S. and other countries covering certain products and have also developed brand names and trademarks for those and other products. Generally, our Specialty Brands business relies upon patent protection to ensure market exclusivity for the life of the patent. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks and license rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement. However, our business is not materially dependent upon any single patent, trademark or license or any group of patents, trademarks or licenses. 
11

The majority of an innovative product's commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. In the branded pharmaceutical industry, an innovator product's market exclusivity is generally determined by two forms of intellectual property: patent rights held by the innovator company and any regulatory forms of exclusivity to which the innovator is entitled. In the U.S. and some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved and marketed, there often are very substantial and rapid declines in the branded product's sales. The rate of this decline varies by country and by therapeutic category; however, following patent expiration, branded products often continue to have some market viability based upon the reputation of the product name, which typically benefits from trademark protection or is based on the difficulties associated with replicating the product formulation or bioavailability. H.P. Acthar Gel is not subject to patent or other exclusivity, with the exception of IS which was granted orphan drug status from the FDA upon its approval in October 2010. H.P. Acthar Gel's commercial durability therefore relies partially upon product formulation trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and trademark and copyright laws. These items may not prevent competitors from independently developing similar technology or duplicating our product. Several of the other products in our Specialty Brands product portfolio currently benefit from these forms of regulatory and patent-conferred exclusivity.
Patents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to exclude others from practicing an invention related to the product. Patents may cover, among other things, the active ingredient(s), various uses of a drug product, pharmaceutical formulations, drug delivery mechanisms, and processes for (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.
Many developed countries provide certain non-patent incentives for the development of pharmaceuticals. For example, the U.S., European Union ("E.U.") and Japan each provide for a minimum period of time after the approval of certain new drugs during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator's data to approve a competitor's generic copy. Regulatory exclusivity is also available in certain markets as incentives for research on new indications, orphan drugs (drugs that demonstrate promise for the diagnosis or treatment of rare diseases or conditions) and medicines that may be useful in treating pediatric patients. Regulatory exclusivity is independent of any patent rights and can be particularly important when a drug lacks broad patent protection. However, most regulatory forms of exclusivity do not prevent a competitor from gaining regulatory approval prior to the expiration of regulatory exclusivity on the basis of the competitor's own safety and efficacy data on its drug, even when that drug is identical to that marketed by the innovator.
We estimate the likely market exclusivity period for each of our branded products on a case-by-case basis. It is not possible to predict with certainty the length of market exclusivity for any of our branded products because of the complex interaction between patent and regulatory forms of exclusivity, the relative success or lack thereof by potential competitors' experience in product development and inherent uncertainties concerning patent litigation. There can be no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full period of time that we currently estimate or that the exclusivity will be limited to the estimate.
In addition to patents and regulatory forms of exclusivity, we also market products with trademarks. Trademarks have no effect on market exclusivity for a product, but are considered to have marketing value. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used; in other countries, as long as registered. Registrations of such trademarks are for fixed terms and subject to renewal as provided by the laws of the particular country.
Regulatory Matters
Quality Assurance Requirements
The FDA enforces regulations to ensure that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packaging and holding of drugs and medical devices conform to current good manufacturing practice ("cGMP"). The cGMP regulations that the FDA enforces are comprehensive and cover all aspects of manufacturing operations, from receipt of raw materials to finished product distribution, and are designed to ensure that the finished products meet all the required identity, strength, quality and purity characteristics. The cGMP regulations for devices, called the Quality System Regulations, are also comprehensive and cover all aspects of device manufacture, from pre-production design validation to installation and servicing, insofar as they bear upon the safe and effective use of the device and whether the device otherwise meets the requirements of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("the FFDCA"). Other regulatory authorities have their own cGMP rules. Ensuring compliance requires a continuous commitment of time, money and effort in all operational areas.
The FDA conducts pre-approval inspections of facilities engaged in the development, manufacture, processing, packaging, testing and holding of the drugs subject to NDAs and Abbreviated New Drug Applications ("ANDA"). If the FDA concludes that the facilities to be used do not or did not meet cGMP, good laboratory practice ("GLP") or good clinical practice ("GCP") requirements, it will not approve the application. Corrective actions to remedy the deficiencies must be performed and are usually verified in a subsequent inspection. In addition, manufacturers of both pharmaceutical products and API used to formulate the drug also ordinarily undergo a pre-approval inspection, although the inspection can be waived when the manufacturer has had a passing cGMP inspection in the 
12

immediate past. Failure of any facility to pass a pre-approval inspection will result in delayed approval and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The FDA also conducts periodic inspections of drug and device facilities to assess their cGMP status. If the FDA were to find serious cGMP non-compliance during such an inspection, it could take regulatory actions that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, imported API and other components needed to manufacture products could be rejected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, usually after conferring with the FDA. In the case of domestic facilities, the FDA could initiate product seizures or, in some instances, require product recalls and seek to enjoin a product's manufacture and distribution. In certain circumstances, violations could support civil penalties and criminal prosecutions. In addition, if the FDA concludes that a company is not in compliance with cGMP requirements, sanctions may be imposed that include preventing that company from receiving the necessary licenses to export its products and classifying that company as an "unacceptable supplier," thereby disqualifying that company from selling products to federal agencies. 
United States
In general, drug manufacturers operate in a highly regulated environment. In the U.S., we must comply with laws, regulations, guidance documents and standards promulgated by the FDA, the Department of Health and Human Services ("DHHS"), the DEA, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the Customs Service and state boards of pharmacy.
The FDA's authority to regulate the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals comes from the FFDCA. In addition to reviewing NDAs, for branded drugs, and ANDAs, for generic drugs, the FDA has the authority to ensure that pharmaceutical products introduced into interstate commerce are neither "adulterated" or "misbranded." Adulterated means that the product may cause or has caused injury to patients when used as intended because it fails to comply with cGMP. Misbranded means that the labels of, or promotional materials for, the product contain false or misleading information. Failure to comply with applicable FDA and other federal and state regulations could result in product recalls or seizures, partial or complete suspension of manufacturing or distribution, refusal to approve pending NDAs or ANDAs, monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
In order to market and sell a new prescription drug product in the U.S., a drug manufacturer must file with the FDA a NDA that shows the safety and effectiveness of (a) a new chemical entity that serves as the API, known as a 505(b)(1) NDA; or (b) a product that has significant differences from an already approved one, known as a 505(b)(2) NDA. Alternatively, in order to market and sell a generic version of an already approved drug product, a drug manufacturer must file an ANDA that shows that the generic version is "therapeutically equivalent," or behaves almost the same when taken by a patient, to the branded drug product and, therefore, is substitutable.
For all pharmaceuticals sold in the U.S., the FDA also regulates sales and marketing to ensure that drug product claims made by manufacturers are neither false or misleading. Manufacturers are required to file copies of all product-specific promotional materials to the FDA's Office of Prescription Drug Promotion prior to their first use. In general, such advertising does not require FDA prior approval. Failure to implement a robust internal company review process and comply with FDA regulations regarding advertising and promotion increases the risk of enforcement action by either the FDA or the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ").
For both NDAs and ANDAs, the manufacture, marketing and selling of certain drug products may be limited by quota grants for controlled substances by the DEA. Refer to "Drug Enforcement Administration" within this Item 1. Business for further information.
NDA Process. The path leading to FDA approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity begins when the drug product is merely a chemical formulation in the laboratory. In general, the process involves the following steps:

• | Completion of formulation and laboratory testing in accordance with GLP that fully characterizes the drug product from a pre-clinical perspective and provides preliminary evidence that the drug product is safe to test in human beings;


• | Filing with the FDA an Investigational New Drug Application that will permit the conduct of clinical trials (testing in human beings under adequate and well-controlled conditions);


• | Designing and conducting clinical trials to show the safety and efficacy of the drug product in accordance with GCP;


• | Submitting the NDA for FDA review, which provides a complete characterization of the drug product;


• | Satisfactory completion of FDA pre-approval inspections regarding the conduct of the clinical trials and the manufacturing processes at the designated facility in accordance with cGMP;


• | If applicable, satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee meeting in which the FDA requests help from outside experts in evaluating the NDA;


• | Final FDA approval of the full prescribing information, labeling and packaging of the drug product; and


• | Ongoing monitoring and reporting of adverse events related to the drug product, implementation of a REMS program, if applicable, and conduct of any required Phase IV studies.

13

Clinical trials are typically conducted in four sequential phases, although they may overlap. The four phases are as follows:

• | Phase I trials are typically small (less than 100 healthy volunteers) and are designed to determine the toxicity and maximum safe dose of the drug product.


• | Phase II trials usually involve 100 to 300 participants and are designed to determine whether the drug product produces any clinically significant effects in patients with the intended disease or condition. If the results of these trials show promise, then a larger Phase III trial may be conducted.


• | Phase III trials are often multi-institution studies that involve a large number of participants and are designed to show efficacy. Phase III (and some Phase II) trials are designed to be pivotal, or confirmatory trials. The goal of a pivotal trial is to establish the safety and efficacy of a drug product by eliminating biases and increasing statistical power.


• | In some cases, the FDA requires Phase IV trials, which are usually performed after the NDA has been approved. Such post-marketing surveillance is intended to obtain more information about the risks of harm, benefits and optimal use of the drug product by observing the results of the drug product in a large number of patients.

 A drug manufacturer may conduct clinical trials either in the U.S. or outside the U.S., but in all cases must comply with GCP, which includes (a) a legally effective informed consent process when enrolling participants; (b) an independent review by an Institutional Review Board to minimize and manage the risks of harm to participants; and (c) ongoing monitoring and reporting of adverse events related to the drug product.
In addition, a drug manufacturer may decide to conduct a clinical trial of a drug product on pediatric patients in order to obtain a form of marketing exclusivity as permitted under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act ("BPCA"). Alternatively, the FDA may require a drug manufacturer, using its authority under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, to conduct a pediatric clinical trial. The goal of conducting pediatric clinical trials is to gather data on how drug products should best be administered to this patient population.
The path leading to FDA approval of a NDA for a drug product that has significant differences from an already approved one is somewhat shorter. The FDA requires a drug manufacturer to submit data from either already published reports or newly conducted studies that show the safety and efficacy of those differences. Significant differences include different dosage strengths or route of administration.
Under the U.S. Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has the authority to collect fees from drug manufacturers who submit NDAs for review and approval. These user fees help the FDA fund the drug approval process. For fiscal 2018, the user fee rate has been set at $2,421,500 for a 505(b)(1) NDA and $1,210,740 for a NDA not requiring a complete clinical data package, generally a 505(b)(2) NDA. We expense these fees as they are incurred. The average review time for a NDA is approximately six months for priority review and ten months for standard review.
ANDA Process. The path leading to FDA approval of an ANDA is much different from that of a NDA. By statute, the FDA waives the requirement for a drug manufacturer to complete pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and instead focuses on data from bioequivalence studies. Bioequivalence studies generally involve comparing the absorption rate and concentration levels of a generic drug in the human body to that of the branded drug or Reference Listed Drug ("RLD"). In the event that the generic drug behaves in the same manner in the human body as the RLD, the two drug products are considered bioequivalent. The FDA considers a generic drug therapeutically equivalent, and therefore substitutable, if it also contains the same active ingredients, dosage form, route of administration and strength.
 In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed into law the Generic Drug User Fee Act to address the FDA's backlog, which at the time was over 2,000 ANDAs. This legislation granted the FDA authority to collect, for the first time, user fees from generic drug manufacturers who submit ANDAs for review and approval, and the fees collected will help the FDA fund the drug approval process. Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017, the fiscal 2018 user fee rate is set at $171,820 for an ANDA and the prior approval supplement to an ANDA fee was removed. These fees are expensed as incurred. The FDA has set goal dates by fiscal year for ANDA submissions to improve the average review time. Fiscal 2018 has a target of approving 90% of ANDA submissions within 10 months of submission.
Aside from the backlog described above, the timing of FDA approval of ANDAs depends on other factors, including whether an ANDA holder has challenged any listed patents to the RLD and whether the RLD is entitled to one or more periods of marketing exclusivity under the FFDCA (such as pediatric exclusivity under the BPCA). In general, the FDA will not approve (but will continue to review) an ANDA in which the RLD holder has sued, within 45 days of receiving notice of the ANDA filing, the ANDA holder for patent infringement until either the litigation has been resolved or 30 months has elapsed, whichever is later.
Patent and Non-Patent Exclusivity Periods. A sponsor of a NDA is required to identify in its application any patent that claims the drug or a use of the drug subject to the application. Upon NDA approval, the FDA lists these patents in the Orange Book. Any person that files a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, the type of NDA that relies upon the data in the application for which the patents are listed, or an ANDA to secure approval of a generic version of a previous drug, must make a certification in respect to listed patents. The FDA may not approve such an application for the drug until expiration of the listed patents unless the generic applicant certifies that the listed patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by the proposed generic drug and gives notice to the holder of the NDA for the 
14

RLD of the bases upon which the patents are challenged, and the holder of the RLD does not sue the later applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receipt of notice. If an infringement suit is filed, the FDA may not approve the later application until the earliest of: (a) 30 months after receipt of the notice by the holder of the NDA for the RLD; (b) entry of an appellate court judgment holding the patent invalid, unenforceable or not infringed; (c) such time as the court may order; or (d) the expiration of the patent.
One of the key motivators for challenging patents is the 180-day market exclusivity period ("generic exclusivity") granted to the developer of a generic version of a product that is the first to make a Paragraph IV certification and that prevails in litigation with the manufacturer of the branded product over the applicable patent(s) or is not sued. For a variety of reasons, there are situations in which a company may not be able to take advantage of an award of generic exclusivity. The determination of when generic exclusivity begins and ends is very complicated.
The holder of the NDA for the RLD may also be entitled to certain non-patent exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an application for a competing generic product or 505(b)(2) NDA product. Generally, if the RLD is a new chemical entity, the FDA may not accept for filing any application that references the innovator's NDA for five years from the approval of the innovator's NDA. However, this five-year period is shortened to four years where a filer's ANDA includes a Paragraph IV certification. In other cases, where the innovator has provided certain clinical study information, the FDA may accept for filing, but may not approve, an application that references the innovator's NDA for a period of three years from the approval of the innovator's NDA.
Certain additional periods of exclusivity may be available if the RLD is indicated for use in a rare disease or condition or is studied for pediatric indications.
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies. For certain drug products or classes, such as transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl ("TIRF") products and extended-release and long-acting opioids, the FDA has the authority to require the manufacturer to provide a REMS that is intended to ensure that the benefits of a drug product (or class of drug products) outweigh the risks of harm. The FDA may require that a REMS program include elements to ensure safe use to mitigate a specific serious risk of harm, such as requiring that the prescriber have particular training or experience or that the drug product is dispensed in certain healthcare settings. The FDA has the authority to impose civil penalties on or take other enforcement action against any drug manufacturer who fails to properly implement an approved REMS program. Separately, a drug manufacturer cannot use an approved REMS program to delay generic competition.
In December 2011, the FDA approved a single, class-wide REMS program for TIRF products (called "the TIRF REMS Access Program") in order to ease the burden on the healthcare system. TIRF products are opioids used to manage pain in adults with cancer who routinely take other opioid pain medicines around-the-clock. We were part of the original industry working group that collaborated to develop and implement the TIRF REMS Access Program. The goals of this program are to ensure patient access to important medications and mitigate the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose and serious complications due to medication errors by: (a) prescribing and dispensing only to appropriate patients, including use only in opioid-tolerant patients; (b) preventing inappropriate conversion between fentanyl products; (c) preventing accidental exposure to children and others for whom such products were not prescribed; and (d) educating prescribers, pharmacists and patients on the potential for misuse, abuse, addiction and overdose. This program started in March 2012 and requires manufacturers, distributors, prescribers, dispensers and patients to enroll in a real-time database that maintains a closed-distribution system.
In February 2009, the FDA requested that drug manufacturers help develop a single, shared REMS for extended-release and long-acting opioid products that contain fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone and oxymorphone. In April 2009, the FDA announced that the "REMS would be intended to ensure that the benefits of these drugs continue to outweigh the risks associated with: (1) use of high doses of long-acting opioids and extended-release opioid products in non-opioid-tolerant and inappropriately selected individuals; (2) abuse; (3) misuse; and (4) overdose, both accidental and intentional." We were part of the original industry working group that collaborated to develop and implement this REMS program. In July 2012, the FDA approved a class-wide REMS program, "the Extended-Release and Long-Acting Opioid Analgesics REMS," that affected more than 30 extended-release and long-acting opioid analgesics (both branded and generic products). This REMS program requires drug manufacturers to make available training on appropriate prescribing practices for healthcare professionals who prescribe these opioid analgesics and to distribute educational materials on their safe use to prescribers and patients.
Drug Enforcement Administration. The DEA is the federal agency responsible for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 ("CSA"). The CSA classifies drugs and other substances based on identified potential for abuse. Schedule I controlled substances, such as heroin and LSD, have a high abuse potential and have no currently accepted medical use; thus, they cannot be lawfully marketed or sold. Opioids, such as oxycodone, oxymorphone, morphine, fentanyl and hydrocodone, are either Schedule II or III controlled substances. Consequently, the manufacture, storage, distribution and sale of these substances are highly regulated.
The DEA regulates the availability of API, products under development and marketed drug products that are Schedule II or III by setting annual quotas. Every year, we must apply to the DEA for manufacturing quota to manufacture API and procurement quota to manufacture finished dosage products. Given that the DEA has discretion to grant or deny our manufacturing and procurement quota requests, the quota the DEA grants may be insufficient to meet our commercial and R&D needs. In calendar 2017, manufacturing and procurement quotas granted by the DEA were sufficient to meet our sales and inventory requirements on most products. In November 
15

2017, the DEA reduced the amount of almost every Schedule II opiate and opioid medication that may be manufactured in the U.S. in calendar year 2018 by 20 percent. A delay or refusal by the DEA to grant, in whole or in part, our quota requests could delay or result in stopping the manufacture of our marketed drug products, new product launches or the conduct of bioequivalence studies and clinical trials.
DEA regulations make it extremely difficult for a manufacturer in the U.S. to import finished dosage forms of controlled substances manufactured outside the U.S. These rules reflect a broader enforcement approach by the DEA to regulate the manufacture, distribution and dispensing of legally produced controlled substances. Accordingly, drug manufacturers who market and sell finished dosage forms of controlled substances in the U.S. typically manufacture or have them manufactured in the U.S.
The DEA also requires drug manufacturers to design and implement a system that identifies suspicious orders of controlled substances, such as those of unusual size, those that deviate substantially from a normal pattern and those of unusual frequency, prior to completion of the sale. A compliant suspicious order monitoring ("SOM") system includes well-defined due diligence, "know your customer" efforts and order monitoring.
To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, tests, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The facilities must have the security, control and accounting mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent loss and diversion. Failure to maintain compliance, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in regulatory action that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings.
Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we, as well as our third-party API suppliers and manufacturers, are subject to such regulation by several states with respect to the manufacture and distribution of these products.
We and, to our knowledge, our third-party API suppliers, dosage form manufacturers, distributors and researchers have all necessary registrations, and we believe all registrants operate in conformity with applicable registration requirements, under controlled substance laws.
Government Benefit Programs. Statutory and regulatory requirements for Medicaid, Medicare, Tricare and other government healthcare programs govern provider reimbursement levels, including requiring that all pharmaceutical companies pay rebates to individual states based on a percentage of their net sales arising from Medicaid program-reimbursed products. The federal and state governments may continue to enact measures in the future aimed at containing or reducing payment levels for prescription pharmaceuticals paid for in whole or in part with government funds. We cannot predict the nature of such measures, which could have material adverse consequences for the pharmaceutical industry as a whole and, consequently, also for us. However, we believe we have provided for our best estimate of potential refunds based on current information available.
From time to time, legislative changes are made to government healthcare programs that impact our business. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 created a new prescription drug coverage program for people with Medicare through a new system of private market drug benefit plans. This law provides a prescription drug benefit to seniors and individuals with disabilities in the Medicare program ("Medicare Part D"). Congress continues to examine various Medicare policy proposals that may result in pressure on the prices of prescription drugs in the Medicare program.
In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, "the Healthcare Reform Act") provided for major changes to the U.S. healthcare system, which impacted the delivery and payment for healthcare services in the U.S. Our business has been most notably impacted by rebates from the Medicaid Fee-For-Service Program and Medicaid Managed Care plans and the imposition of an annual fee on branded prescription pharmaceutical manufacturers. Medicaid provisions reduced net sales by $91.6 million, $94.4 million, $82.3 million and $18.0 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, 2015 and the three months ended December 30, 2016, respectively. The fiscal 2017 decrease in provisions for Medicaid payments is primarily attributable to an $8.5 million decrease associated with Specialty Generics, due to lower net sales in fiscal 2017, which was partially offset by $4.9 million increase associated with H.P. Acthar Gel because of increased net sales during fiscal 2017. The fiscal 2016 increase in provisions for Medicaid payments is primarily attributable to a $16.9 million increase associated with H.P. Acthar Gel, due to double-digit net sales growth, which was partially offset by lower net sales of Specialty Generics. The Company was also impacted by the annual fee on branded prescription pharmaceutical manufacturers, which is not tax deductible, and recorded expense of $21.8 million, $23.3 million, $20.0 million and $8.3 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, 2015 and the three months ended December 30, 2016, respectively, within SG&A.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. For example, in the U.S., there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services or reward past purchases or recommendations, 
16

including the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state statutes, the False Claims Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. These laws apply to hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of our products and are potentially applicable to us as both a manufacturer and a supplier of products reimbursed by federal healthcare programs. In addition, some states in the U.S. have enacted compliance and reporting requirements aimed at drug manufacturers.
We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") of 1977 and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, most of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws; however, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents.
Compliance Programs
In order to systematically and comprehensively mitigate the risks of non-compliance with regulatory requirements described within this Item 1. Business, we have developed what we believe to be robust compliance programs based on the April 2003 Office of the Inspector General ("OIG") Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals, the Code of Ethics of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, the U.K. Anti-Bribery guidance, and other relevant guidance from government and national or regional industry codes of behavior. We conduct ongoing compliance training programs for all employees and maintain a 24-hour ethics and compliance reporting hotline with a strict policy of non-retaliation. Our compliance programs are facilitated by our Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and the Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors. The Compliance function is independent of the manufacturing and commercial operations functions and is responsible for implementing our compliance programs.
As part of our compliance programs, we have implemented internal cross-functional processes to review and approve product-specific promotional materials, presentations and external communications to address the risk of misbranding or mislabeling our products through our promotional efforts. In addition, we have established programs to monitor promotional speaker activities and field sales representatives, which includes a "ride along" program for field sales representatives similar to those included in recent Corporate Integrity Agreements from the OIG in order to obtain first-hand observations of how approved promotional and other materials are used, as well as monitoring of sales representative expenses. We have also implemented a comprehensive controlled substances compliance program, including anti-diversion efforts and we regularly assist federal, state and local law enforcement and prosecutors in the U.S. by providing information and testimony on our products and placebos for use by the DEA and other law enforcement agencies in investigations and at trial. As part of this program, we also work with some of our customers to help develop and implement what we believe are best practices for SOM and other anti-diversion activities.
We believe our compliance programs design also addresses our FDA, healthcare anti-kickback, anti-fraud, and anti-bribery-related risks. We believe we have complied with reporting obligations of the U.S. Federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act and relevant state disclosure laws and have implemented a program across the Company to track and report data per Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") guidance and state disclosure requirements.
Outside the United States
Outside the U.S., we must comply with laws, guidelines and standards promulgated by other regulatory authorities that regulate the development, testing, manufacturing, marketing and selling of pharmaceuticals, including, but not limited to, Health Canada, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the U.K., the Irish Medicines Board, the European Medicines Agency and member states of the E.U., the State Food and Drug Administration in China, the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia, the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority, the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Japan, the European Pharmacopoeia of the Council of Europe and the International Conference on Harmonization. Although international harmonization efforts continue, many laws, guidelines and standards differ by region or country.
We currently market our products in Canada, in various countries in the E.U., and in the Latin American, Middle Eastern, African and Asia-Pacific regions. The approval requirements and process vary by country, and the time required to obtain marketing authorization may vary from that required for FDA approval. Certain drug products and variations in drug product lines also must meet country-specific and other local regulatory requirements. The following discussion highlights some of the differences in the approval process in other regions or countries outside the U.S.
17

European Union. Marketing authorizations are obtained pursuant to either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which provides for a single marketing authorization valid for all E.U. member states, is mandatory for the approval of certain drug products and is optional for novel drug products that are in the interest of patient health. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted for review to the European Medicines Agency, which makes a recommendation on the application to the European Commission, who determines whether or not to approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides for concurrent mutual recognition of national approval decisions, and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure.
The E.U. has also adopted directives and other laws that govern the labeling, marketing, advertising, supply, distribution and drug safety monitoring and reporting of drug products. Such directives set regulatory standards throughout the E.U. and permit member states to supplement such standards with additional requirements.
European governments also regulate drug prices through the control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of such costs to patients. Many regulate the pricing of a new drug product at launch through direct price controls or reference pricing and, recently, some have also imposed additional cost-containment measures on drug products. Such differences in national pricing regimes may create price differentials between E.U. member states. Many European governments also advocate generic substitution by requiring or permitting prescribers or pharmacists to substitute a different company's generic version of a brand drug product that was prescribed, and patients are unlikely to take a drug product that is not reimbursed by their government.
Emerging Markets. Many emerging markets continue to evolve their regulatory review and oversight processes. At present, such countries typically require prior regulatory approval or marketing authorization from large, developed markets (such as the U.S.) before they will initiate or complete their review. Some countries also require the applicant to conduct local clinical trials as a condition of marketing authorization. Many emerging markets continue to implement measures to control drug product prices, such as implementing direct price controls or advocating the prescribing and use of generic drugs.
Environmental
Our operations, like those of other pharmaceutical companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing processes and, as such, we are subject to numerous federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations. We cannot provide assurance that we have been or will be in full compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations at all times. Certain environmental laws assess strict (i.e., can be imposed regardless of fault) and joint and several liability on current or previous owners of real property and current or previous owners or operators of facilities for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at such properties or at properties at which parties have disposed of hazardous substances. We have, from time to time, received notification from the EPA and from state environmental agencies in the U.S. that conditions at a number of sites where the disposal of hazardous substances has taken place requires investigation, cleanup and other possible remedial actions. These agencies may require that we reimburse the government for costs incurred at these sites or otherwise pay for the cost of investigation and cleanup of these sites including compensation for damage to natural resources. We have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations, as further described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 19 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Environmental laws are complex and generally have become more stringent over time. We believe that our operations currently comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations, and have planned for future capital and operating expenditures to comply with these laws and to address liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances. However, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection, health and safety laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Further, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending environmental matters, it is reasonably possible that there will be a need for future provisions for environmental costs that, in the Company's opinion, are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but could be material to the results of operations in any one accounting period.
Raw Materials
We contract with various third-party manufacturers and suppliers, most notably related to our Specialty Brands products, to provide us with raw materials used in our products, finished goods and certain services. If, for any reason, we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials, finished goods, services or components required for our products, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The active ingredients in the majority of our current Specialty Generics products and products in development, including oxycodone, oxymorphone, morphine, fentanyl and hydrocodone, are listed by the DEA as Schedule II or III substances under the CSA. Consequently, their manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation and the DEA limits both the availability of these active ingredients and the production of these products. As discussed in "Regulatory Matters" within this Item 1. Business, we must annually apply to the DEA for procurement and production quotas in order to obtain and produce these substances. The DEA has complete discretion to adjust these quotas from time to time during the calendar year and, as a result, our procurement and production quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or to conduct bioequivalence studies and clinical trials. Any delay or refusal by the DEA in granting, in whole or in part, our quota requests for controlled substances could delay or result in the stoppage of the manufacture of our pharmaceutical products, our clinical trials or product launches and could require us to allocate product among our customers.
Sales, Marketing and Customers
Sales and Marketing
We market our branded products to physicians (including neurologists, rheumatologists, nephrologists, pulmonologists, ophthalmologists, neonatologists and surgeons), pharmacists, pharmacy buyers, hospital procurement departments, ambulatory surgical centers, and specialty pharmacies. We distribute our branded and generic products through independent channels, including wholesale drug distributors, specialty pharmaceutical distributors, retail pharmacy chains, hospital networks, ambulatory surgical centers and governmental agencies. In addition, we contract with GPOs and managed care organizations to improve access to our products. We sell and distribute API directly or through distributors to other pharmaceutical companies.
For further information on our sales and marketing strategies, refer to "Our Businesses and Product Strategies" included within this Item 1. Business.
Customers
Net sales to distributors that accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016, 2015 and the three months ended December 30, 2016 were as follows:

 | Fiscal Year Ended | | Three Months Ended
 | December 29, 2017 | | December 30, 2016 | | December 25, 2015 | December 30, 2016
CuraScript, Inc. | 40 | % | | 38 | % | 35 | % | 43 | %
McKesson Corporation | * | | | 12 | % | 20 | % | 10 | %
AmerisourceBergen Corporation | * | | | * | | 10 | % | * | 
Cardinal Health, Inc. | * | | | * | | 11 | % | * | 

* - Net sales to these distributors were less than 10% of our total net sales during the respective periods presented above.
No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in the above periods presented. 
Manufacturing and Distribution
As of December 29, 2017, we had nine manufacturing sites, including seven located in the U.S., as well as sites in Canada and Ireland, which handle production, assembly, quality assurance testing, packaging and sterilization of products for our Specialty Brands and Specialty Generics segments. Approximately, 93% and 7% of our manufacturing production (as measured by cost of production) was performed within the U.S. and Canada, respectively, in fiscal 2017.
As of December 29, 2017, we maintained distribution centers in 9 countries. In addition, in certain countries outside the U.S. we utilize third-party distribution centers. Products generally are delivered to these distribution centers from our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer. In some instances, product is delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer. We contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products by road, rail, sea and air.
We utilize contract manufacturing organizations ("CMOs") to manufacture certain of our finished goods that are available for resale. We most frequently utilize CMOs in the manufacture of our Specialty Brands products, including H.P. Acthar Gel (for finish and filling of the product), Ofirmev, Recothrom and Therakos products.

Backlog
At December 29, 2017, the backlog of firm orders was less than 1% of net sales. We anticipate that substantially all of the backlog as of December 29, 2017 will be shipped during fiscal 2018.
Seasonality
We have historically experienced fluctuations in our business resulting from seasonality. For example, H.P. Acthar Gel has typically experienced lower net sales during the first calendar quarter compared to other calendar quarters, which we believe is partially attributable to effects of annual insurance deductibles and certain medical conditions being exacerbated by warm temperatures. In addition, we have historically experienced lower operating cash flows during the period in which we pay annual employee compensation. In previous years, annual employee compensation was paid during the fourth calendar quarter; however, given the change in our fiscal year end to the last Friday in December from the last Friday in September, we now expect to pay annual employee compensation during the first calendar quarter. DEA quotas for raw materials and final dosage products are allocated in each calendar year to companies and may impact our sales until the DEA grants additional quotas, if any. Impacts from quota limitations are most commonly experienced during the third and fourth calendar quarters, and we have experienced lower net sales in DEA controlled products during the fourth calendar quarter. While we have experienced these fluctuations in the past, they may not be indicative of what we will experience in the future.
Employees
At December 29, 2017, we had approximately 3,900 employees, approximately 3,400 of which are based in the U.S. Certain of these employees are represented by unions or work councils. We believe that we generally have a good relationship with our employees, and with the unions and work councils that represent certain employees.
