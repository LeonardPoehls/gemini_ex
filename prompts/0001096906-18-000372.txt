ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
Overview
  

 China YCT International Group, Inc. ("the Company", or "we", "us", "our") is a diversified and vertically integrated health care company, which is engaged in developing, manufacturing and selling innovative traditional Chinese medicines, including manufacturing our medicines made primarily from panax ginseng leaves extract, developing acer truncatum bunge planting bases, processing and selling acer truncatum bunge seed oils, and distributing health care products manufactured by another company in the PRC.
 
We operate through our 97% owned subsidiary, Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. ("Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical"), a corporation organized in the People's Republic of China. Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical was originally organized as a subsidiary of Shandong Yongchuntang Group Co., Ltd. ("Shandong Yongchuntang") for the purpose of focusing on advanced technology related to the use of gingko as an aide to health. Shandong Yongchuntang later transferred ownership of Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical to its equity-holders, who transferred their ownership to our Company in 2007.

Corporate History
 
While we now develop, manufacture and sell our own products, including Huoliyuan capsules and seed oil from the acer truncatum bunge trees, Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical initially served solely as a distributor for Shandong Yongchuntang pursuant to a distribution agreement signed in 2006 that fixed the purchase price that would be paid by Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical for products purchased from Shandong Yongchuntang. Mr. Tinghe Yan, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, was the principal stockholder of Shandong Yongchuntang until he sold all of his shares of Shandong Yongchuntang to an unrelated party on December 16, 2009.
 
In January 1989, the Company was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida under the name of Medical Technology & Innovations, Inc. On April 4, 2007, the Company reincorporated in the State of Delaware by merging with and into ItLinkz Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Medical Technology & Innovations, Inc. As a result of the merger, ItLinkz Group, Inc. was the surviving corporation.
 
Landway Nano Bio-Tech Group, Inc. was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in 2006.  In June 2007, Landway Nano Bio-Tech paid $2.58 million to acquire 100% of the stock of Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical, which was then owned by Mr. Tinghe Yan and Mr. Tingrong Yan.
 
On September 28, 2007, ItLinkz Group, Inc. ("ItLinkz Group") acquired the outstanding capital stock of Landway Nano Bio-Tech Group, Inc. In connection with the closing of the acquisition on September 28, 2007, ItLinkz Group issued to the stockholders of Landway Nano Bio-Tech 500 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, which were convertible into 404,933,115 shares of common stock. Tinghe Yan and Jirui Zhang, the executive officers of Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical, became members of the Board, and became, respectively, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of ItLinkz Group. On November 23, 2007, ItLinkz Group, Inc. changed its name to China YCT International Group, Inc. Upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock, Messrs. Tinghe Yan and Jirui Zhang became the principal holders of common stock of the Company.
 
On March 18, 2017, we entered into an acquisition agreement with Shandong Yongchuntang pursuant to which we acquired the Acer Truncatum Industrial Project. Pursuant to the agreement, we transferred 3% of the equity of Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical, in exchange for tangible and intangible assets related to the Acer Truncatum Industrial Project in Shandong Province.

Industry Background and Market Opportunities
  
Acer Truncatum Bunge Market Opportunity


 Acer truncatum bunge (Shantung maple, Shandong maple, or purpleblow maple) is native to the Chinese provinces of Gansu, Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu, Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shandong, and Shanxi, and to Korea. Traditionally, acer truncatum bunge is an important tree species for afforestation and soil and water conservation, which brings social and ecological benefits. In addition, research has demonstrated that acer truncatum bunge has great value for development and utilization as food, medicine and chemical raw materials.
 
Acer truncatum bunge produces nervonic acid, an extract from its seeds that is the principal extract from which acer truncatum bungee seed oil is derived. As a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid, nervonic acid is believed to be beneficial to memory-related brain health, anti-aging, blood lipid regulation, anti-fatigue. Omega 9 includes several types of fats. However, four of them which are the most important: oleic acid, mead acid, erucic acid and nervonic acid. Nervonic acid has been identified as important in the biosynthesis of nerve cell myelin. It is found in the sphingolipids of white matter in human brain. Nervonic acid is used in the treatment of disorders involving demyelination, such as adrenoleukodystrophy and multiple sclerosis where there is a decreased level of nervonic acid in sphingolipids.

Scientific research reveals that nervonic acid can advance the re-growth of neurons. It possesses several medical effects, such as, repairing and dredging the speedway of transferring nervonic information nerve fiber to dredge the brain route, repair the injured cranial nerve cells, and advance the re-growth of cranial nerves.   Nervonic acid can also increase the energy of brain cells, advance the multiplication and differentiation of cells, prevent the cranial nerve cells from consenescence and injury, recover the clear perceive ability, distinguishing ability, study ability and memory. Nervonic acid may be effective to prevent senile dementia.
 
In Europe and the United States, nervonic acid is mainly extracted from shark brains or shark oils. The extraction process and technique are difficult, and the final cost can exceed $45,359 per pound. In addition, certain species of sharks are protected by the United Nations and many countries in the world, so animal sources of nervonic acid are not as acceptable as in the past. Biosynthesis from chemicals or other intermediates are not presently available because either the yield is low or too many unhealthy by-products are produced.
  4
 
Therefore, the most efficient principal sources of nervonic acid are plants and herbs. Malania oleifera is rich in nervonic acid.  It is native to southern China in the western provinces such as Guangxi and southeastern Yunnan. Its content of nervonic acid is up to 40.92% to 50% of the lipid (usually triglyceride). However, Malania oleifera is a threatened species, and it is on the list of key wild plants for state protection. Therefore, there is no opportunity for commercial extraction form wild malaria oleifera. Cultured malania oleifera plants are experimental in some areas.



We believe the best source for producing nervonic acid at commercial scale is acer truncatum bunge seed. There are different extraction methods being used to produce nervonic acid from acer truncatum bungee seed, one of which is Supercritical Carbon Doxide. The analysis revealed that such method could yield approximately 6.22% nervonic acid. We have pioneered an extraction method that allows us to achieve similar nervonic acid yield in a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner.
 
 According to the statistics provided by Herb Nutritionals Co., ltd, the table below is a list of natural food resources of nervonic acid from both plants and animals, with nervonic acid content in mg/100g:
 

Nervonic Acid Content (mg/100g)
-------------------------------
Acer Truncatum | 580 
Brassica Oil Seeds | 69-83
Sesame Seeds | 35 
Macadamia Nuts | 18 
Tropaeolum Speciosum | 10 
Lunaria (Money Plant) | 8 
King Salmon (Chinook) | 140 
Sockeye Salmon | 40 

  
We believe that favorable claims regarding nervonic acid from several independent studies are credible. While we rely on these independent studies for guidance, we cannot verify these claims with any degree of certainty.
 
We believe that demand for high-quality/low-price acer truncatum bunge seed oil will increase in part due to demand from elderly Chinese and its use as a health supplement. We sell acer truncatum bunge seed oil for approximately 1,000 RMB/kg (approximately $67.41 per pound). The annual production of acer truncatum bunge oil in China was only about 12.4 tons (approximately 27337.32 pounds) in 2017.


 
We believe we are the leader of China's acer truncatum bunge seed oil production industry according to the market statistics that we have collected:

Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd | | 73.84 | | 5.9 | | 47.7 | %
Total | | 155 | | 12.4 | | 100 | %

Health Care Spending

 
We believe that China's increasing per capita disposable income, aging population and demand for traditional Chinese medicines and treatments should support increased demand for our Huoliyuan capsules, acer truncatum bunge seed oil products and other health care products. The increase in the per capita disposable income of Chinese urban residents and the increase in the number of elderly people in China in recent years have resulted in increasing spending on prescription and OTC medicines, including traditional Chinese medicine. According to the China Statistical Abstract 2017, the average annual per capita disposable income of Chinese urban residents increased to RMB 36,396 (approximately $5,177) in 2017 from RMB 21,810 (approximately $3,240) in 2011, and the average annual per capita disposable income of Chinese rural residents increased to RMB 13,432 (approximately $1,911) in 2017 from RMB 6,977 (approximately $1,036) in 2011. During the same period, the annual per capita expenditures on healthcare and medical services by Chinese urban residents increased to RMB1,777 (approximately $253) in 2017 from RMB1610.48 (approximately $239) in 2011, and the annual per capita expenditures on healthcare and medical services by Chinese rural residents increased to RMB 1,059 (approximately $151) in 2017 from RMB 697 (approximately $104) in 2011.
 
Increasing health care expenditures in China create significant opportunities for our growth. According to research conducted by CFDA Southern Medical Economic Research Institute, China's pharmaceutical market, based on both prescription and OTC medicine sales, increased to RMB1,612 trillion (approximately $229 billion) in 2017 from RMB 809.7 billion (approximately $120 billion) in 2011. China now has the world's fastest growing major healthcare market with a five-year compound annual growth rate of 17%, compared to 4% in the United States and 2% in Japan, according to data from the World Health Organization. China is the second largest healthcare market globally with total healthcare expenditures reaching $594 billion in 2015, a number projected to reach $1.1 trillion by 2020, according to 2016 Top Markets Report Pharmaceuticals by International Trade Administration. Considerable growth in China's healthcare market is anticipated as continue with per capita health spending is $420, compared to an average of over $5,800 for the world's top eight healthcare markets, according to data from IMS Market Prognosis.

We believe that China's aging population is a key contributor to the increased expenditures on medicines because elderly people on average spend more on healthcare than younger people. China's aging population is expected to increase the burden of chronic disease by 40% by the year 2030, according to a paper Toward a Healthy and Harmonious Life in China: Stemming the Rising Tide of Non-Communicable Diseases by World Bank. Over the past 20 years the number of people aged over 65 has nearly doubled reaching 150 million (10.8% of the total population) according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. The portion of the Chinese population aged 60 and above and aged 65 and above has increased in both absolute numbers and as a percentage of the total population, and we believe that this trend is likely to continue in the foreseeable future. According to statistics from National Bureau of Statistics of China, the number of people in China aged 60 and above was approximately 231 million in 2016, or 16.7% of China's entire population, compared to approximately 153 million, or 11.6% of China's entire population in 2007. The number of people in China aged 65 and above was approximately 150 million in 2016, or 10.8% of China's entire population, compared to approximately 106 million, or 8.1% of China's entire population in 2007.

Traditional Chinese Medicine

 
Traditional Chinese medicine is a medical system developed in China about 3,000 years ago and is therefore deeply ingrained in Chinese culture. It is based on the concept that one's health depends on a constant struggle between various opposing forces (e.g.), yin and yang, or hot and cold). Excesses or imbalances in the body cause sickness or disease, with Chinese herbal medicines helping to restore balance and nurse the body back to health. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners emphasize preventative medicine and treating diseases before they occur through healthy living and proper diets. This is especially important in China, which has increasing obesity, diabetes and smoking rates.

Historically, traditional Chinese medicine, or TCM, consisted primarily of mixtures of dried herbs and, in some cases, animal parts and minerals. These mixtures would be boiled and simmered at home to create a medicinal tea or soup. These liquid concoctions were inconvenient to prepare and take, and their dosage and quality were inconsistent due to varied methods of preparation and differences in the quality of ingredients. In recent decades, however, pharmaceutical companies in China have applied modern production technologies to extract active ingredients out of the mixtures and formulate the extracts into a variety of dosage forms such as tablets, capsules and granules, which we refer to as modernized traditional Chinese medicines. These modernized formulations offer patients convenient forms of traditional Chinese medicine and also substantially improve their quality, consistency and dosage precision.
  
Traditional Chinese medicine has enjoyed a resurgence championed by the Chinese government. In December 2016, China's State Council issued the "Strategic Plan on the Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine" making the development of traditional Chinese medicine a national strategy. The traditional Chinse medicine industry grew by 20% in 2017, with revenue of $130 billion, or one third of total medical industry output, according to the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine.
  7
 
Additionally, the Department of Forestry of Shandong Province, where we are based, has issued its plan to reform and upgrade the industry for 2016 – 2020 in Shandong (the "Plan"). The Plan specifically encourage the expansion of the wood-based oil extract industry and identifies the acer truncatum bungee trees as one of plants whose production is encouraged. The Department of Forestry of Shandong Province recognized us as one of the leaders in the province's wood-based oil extract industry. The Plan also identifies us as one of the companies in the industry that may have good potential to sell the acer truncatum bungee seed oil products internationally.

 Our Competitive Strengths


 We believe the following competitive strengths have contributed to, or will contribute to, our recent and ongoing growth:
 
Dominant Producer of Acer Truncatum Bunge Seed Oil
 
We believe that we are the largest producer of acer truncatum bunge seed oil in China, accounting for 47.7% of the market in China in 2017. We also obtained a food production license for the production of edible vegetable oil from the Food and Drug Administration of Sishui County, and expect to produce blended edible oil products that contain acer truncatum bungee seed oil as one of the major ingredients. We believe that being the dominant producer and having stronger vertically integrated production capabilities will provide us with advantages in pricing and distribution of our products and spur further growth.
Diversified Revenue and Profit Stream
 

We generate revenue through the sales of diversified products, including prescription medicines, acer truncatum bunge seed oil products, and nine health care products purchased from Shandong Yongchuntang. With a diversified revenue stream, which can reduce financial stress during times of economic decline by relying on more than a single product, we believe alternative revenue sources provide the diversification to create a more financially stable company as well as additional opportunities for growth.
Strong Relationship with Key Distributors


 
We conduct our sales primarily through our seven distributors, who collectively control a 200,000+ person direct sales force and use person-to-person marketing to promote and sell our acer truncatum bunge seed oil products and nine products purchased from Shandong Yongchuntang. Compared to health and nutrition products that are distributed through traditional market means, these personal marketing efforts are supported by various mediums, including our marketing content, websites, events and social business solutions. We believe our distribution channel is an effective vehicle to distribute our products because:

• | representatives can educate consumers about our products face-to-face, which we believe is more effective for differentiating our products than using traditional mass-media advertising;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | our distribution channel allows for actual product demonstrations and trial by potential consumers; 
• | our distribution channel allows the representatives to provide personal testimonials of product efficacy; and 
• | as compared to other distribution methods, the representative has the opportunity to provide consumers higher levels of service and encourage repeat purchases. 

Reputable Brands
 
Our acer truncatum bunge seed oil products are distributed under the recognized brand name "Bao Feng San Yi". In addition, we believe that we are the largest producer of Huoliyuan capsules and tablets in China, that our Huoliyuan capsule is the only herbal medicine of its type made in the form of a capsule, and that we are recognized by customers as a leader in the Huoliyuan market. Other peer products are produced in the form of tablets.  The capsule permits the medication to be formulated for slow release. We believe that our reputable brand name will benefit our future expansion and growth efforts.
  8
 
 Raw Materials Competitive Pricing
 
Our goal is to be a vertically integrated acer truncatum bunge seed oil and blended edible oil producer once our own trees begin production, which is expected to occur in the fall of 2018.  While to date we have produced acer truncatum bunge seed oil from raw materials purchased from third parties, we began to develop and cultivate our own trees in June 2013. We have leased 5,880 mu (approximately 2,324.77 acres) of farmland for terms of 30 years and 14 years, respectively, and have planted approximately 7 million trees at a cost of approximately $49 million through March 31, 2018. Having our own tree base will significantly reduce our cost to produce the seed oils compared to our competitors that purchase the acer truncatum bunge pods from third parties.
Experienced Management
 


We are led by highly experienced and entrepreneurial executive officers. Mr. Tinghe Yan, our founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has over twenty years of experience in corporate management within the food and food supplements industries. Mr. Yan founded Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical in 2006.  From 1998 to 2006, Mr. Yan was employed as the Chairman and General Manager of Shandong Yongchuntang, which manufactures a wide variety of food supplements and health care products and is currently the exclusive supplier of nine health care products distributed by Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical.
Our Growth Strategy
 
To maintain the growth of our business, we expect to rely on these key drivers:
 
Leverage and Expand our Existing Distributor Base Throughout China 
 
China has been and will continue to be our largest market. Our growth strategy in China involves multiple initiatives, such as the launch our proposed edible oil products, continued investment in company-sponsored events and distributor training, and better utilization of our upper-level distributors across different geographical areas to increase our distributor base.
 
 Expansion of manufacturing infrastructure and increased productivity for new businesses
 
Our production volume can be improved with additional equipment and infrastructure. We intend toinvest in our infrastructure to increase capacity and thereby be able to increase our production volume and expand our sales.
 
Vertical Integration
 
Our ability to initiate and increase production of the raw material for the acer truncatum bunge seed oil is expected to lower our cost of goods sold by eliminating our reliance on third party suppliers. We believe that over the next five years, the approximately 7 million trees on 5,880 mu (approximately 2,324.77 acres) of land will begin to produce seeds for processing into oil beginning in the fall of 2018 until all trees are expected to mature by 2022. We also expect to increase the productivity of our acreage as we gain experience in growing, maintaining and harvesting the trees.
Direct Sales Channel
 
We expect to continue to expand the number of salespeople participating in our direct sales channel that is used for the sale of the acer truncatum seed oil products and the health care products that we distribute.  We expect to also add additional products to this distribution channel, such as the proposed edible oil products, thereby increasing revenues.
  9
 
Achieving a dominant position in the acer truncatum bunge seed oil products market
 
With years of strategic preparations and planning behind us, we are seeing tremendous growth opportunities in this business segment, as consumers have paid growing attention to personal healthcare matters associated with aging. We plan to focus our sales in this sector as our strategic priority for the next few years.
 
Invest in Improved and New Products 
 
As a developer of prescription medicine with our Huoliyuan capsule, and acer truncatum bunge seed oil related products, we believe that it is vital to continue to invest in the research and development of new and innovative products. We will continue to improve and validate the efficacy of our existing product line. These types of investments should facilitate customer and distributor retention, as well as the recruitment of new distributors.
 
 Enter new markets and further penetrate existing markets
 We believe there is a significant opportunity to increase our net sales. We have a business model that is compatible across all of our markets and encourages our distributors to pursue their business in multiple markets. We believe this business model supports expansion of our distributor network into international markets and will provide a framework that facilitates our entry into new international markets. To that end, we continue to monitor business conditions in potential new markets and will selectively expand as timing and conditions are appropriate.

 Mergers and Acquisitions
 
We closely follow and investigate potentially profitable and strategic acquisitions and combinations within our industry. We continuously seek synergistic partnerships to acquire additional technologies, products, services, operations and/or geographic capabilities that can provide long-term growth. While we currently do not have any specific mergers or acquisition targets, we plan to explore the possibility of completing a few vertical or horizontal acquisitions in the next few years to expand our presence in the industry. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete any such acquisitions.
 Our Major Products
 
Huoliyuan Capsule
 
We manufacture our Huoliyuan capsule according to traditional Chinese medicine concepts. The main ingredients of the Huoliyuan capsule are traditional Chinese herbal medicines, including Panax Ginseng leaves extracts, Radix Astragali, Radix Ophiopogonis, Schisandra Chinensis and Monkshood. We believe that our Huoliyuan capsule is the only herbal medicine of its type made in a capsule among all peer products.  Other peer products are in the form of tablets.
 
 The Huoliyuan capsule is used with respect to various medical conditions and was approved by the State Food and Drug Administration (the "SFDA") of China on June 10, 2008. The Huoliyuan capsules can be purchased only by prescription.
 
The therapeutic effect of Huoliyuan was tested by anindependent analysts at the Jining Institute for Drug Control in 2003. The test primarily consists of a Character Test, Identification Test, Water Index, Load Difference, Disintegration Time and Microbial Limit. The test concluded that Huoliyuan was beneficial for the human cardiovascular system and as an aid in the treatment of chronic hepatitis, diabetes, insomnia, memory loss, menopause syndrome, and other maladies.  The Huoliyuan capsule is formulated for slow release and daily use.
  10
 
We first began development of the Huoliyuan capsule in January 2007, when we purchased a patent from Beijing Boya Research Institution, Ltd. We commenced manufacture of Huoliyuan capsules in 2010. During the year ended March 31, 2018, we produced approximately 5.87 million boxes of 3 pack capsules and 3.12 million boxes of 2 pack capsules.  


 The Development of Acer Truncatum Bunge Planting Base
 
 On March 22, 2011, the Chinese Ministry of Health officially approved acer truncatum bunge seed oil, along with peony seed oil, as a new food resource (No. 9 Announcement issued in 2011). Subsequently, in December 2011, the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission, jointly with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, issued the Twelfth Five-year Development Plan of Food Industry, whereby "the nutrition and health food manufacturing industry" was listed for the first time in the national development plan as a focused developing area.
 
We initiated an investment plan (the "Plan") to take advantage of the national policy and began to develop and cultivate our own planting base for acer truncatum bunge in June 2013. As of March 31, 2018, we have completed our investment of approximately $49 million in the development of the acer truncatum bunge planting base.  We expect to spend about $1,500,000 per year to maintain our planting base without further expansion.
 
The trees are expected to begin production from the fall of 2018 through 2022 and we have also completed the construction of the planting fields and related support facilities. We signed three separate lease agreements for a total of 5,880 mu (approximately 2,324.77 acres) of farmland for terms of either 30 years or 14 years, and have completed planting of approximately 7 million trees. We have also developed cooperation relationships with local farmers by providing seeds and planting techniques, resulting in another 5,320 mu (approximately 2,103.36 acres) of acer truncatum bunge trees planted by local farmers.
 
Since July 2015, we have been purchasing acer truncatum pods from third party vendors, and have extracted the pods to produce the acer truncatum bunge seed oils. We sell the acer truncatum bunge seed oils products to customers through our distributors participating in the direct sales channel. Based on our current manufacturing technology, we expect that we will be able to extract about an average of 1pound of acer truncatum seed oil per 10 pounds of acer truncatum bunge seeds. Until our own planting base begins production, we will continue to purchase the acer truncatum bunge pods from third parties used to manipulate our acer truncatum bunge seed oil. The following chart reflects the projected schedule of maturation of our trees.

  Orange: Oil Production (tons)    11
 
Acer Truncatum Bunge Seed Oils and Capsules


We manufacture the "Bao Feng San Yi" brand of acer truncatum bungee seed oil by use of advanced cold-pressed extraction technology, which oil contains rich nervonic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid and other essential fatty acids. The oil is edible, clear and without impurities and the products may be purchased without a prescription.
 
The bottled products have two specifications, 300mg, which is for children between the ages of 7 and 18, and 500 mg, which is for middle-aged to elderly people. Long-term consumption of the 300mg product may stimulate children's nervous system and mental development and improve their memory function and their learning ability. The 500mg product may improve the nervous system and enhance the body's stress ability. It may also improve digestion, immunity, blood circulation, and memory function, and decrease the rate of brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.
 
We also manufacture the acer truncatum bungee seed soft capsule (acer truncatum bungee seed gel-type candy) under the brand name" Bao Feng San Yi" by using acer truncatum bungee seed oil as the main raw material, and adding probiotics to promote the proliferation of fructo-oligosaccharides and lactose, and edible gelatin as a supplement. The product has a similar effect as the "Bao Feng San Yi" brand acer truncatum bungee seed oil.
 
High-grade Acer Truncatum Bunge Seed Blended Edible Oils (Cooking)
  
China's consumption of high-end edible oil is gradually increasing, the consumption of soybean oil, palm oil, rapeseed oil in the domestic market share still account for the top three. China's overall consumption of edible oil was approximately 34.67 million tons in 2015, with the average individual consumption of 24.8 kilogram.


We expect to produce blended edible oil products for use as a cooking oil that contain acer truncatum bungee seed oil as one of the major ingredients. On January 11, 2018, the Food and Drug Administration of Sishui County ratified and issued us a Food Production License for production of edible vegetable oil, which includes acer truncatum bunge seed oil, and related blended edible oil products and is valid for five years.
 
Edible oil is mainly divided into two categories: animal oil and vegetable oil. Animal oil contains more saturated fatty acids and cholesterol, which may cause hypertension, arteriosclerosis, coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia and cerebrovascular diseases by long term consumption. Compared with animal fats and other vegetable oils, certain vegetable oils that contain more monounsaturated acid content have more nutritional value.
 
Our high-grade blended edible oils include extracts of acer truncatum bunge seed oils, peony seed oil and walnut oil by using advanced cold-pressed extraction, refinery and reconciliation processing technologies. We refine the oils with modern nano-activation technology and quantum-implantation, which improves the solubility, penetration and human body absorption rate. We blend the oil by using the blended ratio of 1: 1: 1.
 
This product will contain linoleic acid, linolenic acid and other unsaturated fatty acids. The amount of linoleic acid content in our product is twice that of peanut oil, and ten time that of olive oil. Long-term consumption of our product may have good effects, including but not limited to repairing damaged nerves, lowering lipids, softening blood vessels, lowering blood pressure and promoting blood circulation.
 
 Other Health Care Products from Shandong Yongchuntang
 
Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical has served as a distributor for Shandong Yongchuntang since January 2007. Pursuant to our distribution agreement with Shandong Yongchuntang, dated as of February 21, 2018, which is subject to automatic annual renewal, we purchase nine products from Shandong Yongchuntang at fixed prices and resell them by using the direct-sales license issued to Shandong Yongchuntang. Our direct-sales sublicense agreement with Shandong Yongchuntang will expire on June 30, 2020, we are entitled the right of first refusal on the renewal of the sublicense agreement. The sublicense agreement requires us to increase the annual sales no less than 20% each year by using 2014 annual sales volume of RMB 35 million (approximately $5.28 million) as a benchmark. If we fail to reach the sales target, we are required to pay a royalty of RMB 10 million (approximately $1.6 million) to Shandong Yongchuntang. To date, we have achieved growth of sales of a minimum of 20% per year each year and not been required to pay such fee. The nine products that we purchase from Shandong Yongchuntang accounted for $26,297,055 in revenue, or 40.5% of total revenue, in the year ended March 31, 2018. Of the nine products, Healthcare Products Portfolio No. 3, Ginkgo Herbal Tea, and Magnetic mattress products, accounted for 24.4% of our total revenue in the year ended March 31, 2018. The nine products consist of the following:

Patents     
In March 2010, we purchased a patent from Shandong Yongchuntang for RMB 46 million (approximately $6.74 million at the time), which enabled us to manufacture and distribute medicine products for cardio cerebral vascular disease, cosmetics, and healthcare products. The patent acquired from Shandong Yongchuntang was independently assessed at a fair value of  RMB 76 million (approximately $11.14 million at the time) by Beijing Beifang Yashi Asset Evaluation Company based on the current income value method. The purchase price for the patent was negotiated between our Company and Shandong Yongchuntang based on the assessed value and was purchased by us at a discount. The patent is for an aglycone type and purification method of biotransformation in herbal product manufacturing process to extracting herbal flavonoid more extensively, and it has a legal life of 16.5 years. We have not yet commercialized the patent.

On October 26, 2010, Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical signed an agreement to purchase two patents relating to Chinese herbal formulas from Jining Tianruitong Technology Development Limited Company for RMB 72 million  (approximately $11.4 million at the time). We received an independent assessment of the value of the patents, which substantiated the purchase price. Approval from the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC was required for the transfer of the patent. We obtained governmental approvals for the transfer of the two patents in October 2011, which were transferred to us. The two patents are "Treatment to ischemic encephalopathy and its preparation method" (ZL200510045001.9) and "Chinese herbal medicine compound to treat renal insufficiency and its preparation" (ZL200710013301.8), with legal lives of approximately 14 years and 15 years, respectively. One patent was fully impaired in the year ended March 31, 2016. We have not yet commercialized the second patent.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and product development activities include:
  14
 


• | Internal research, product development and quality testing; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Joint research projects, collaborations studies; 
• | Identification and assessment of technologies for potential licensing arrangements; and
• | Acquisition of technologies. 

  
We are committed to developing and marketing innovative products. We have several products in development, including skin care products, nutritional supplements, and edible vegetable oil. Our goal is to utilize advanced biological technology to isolate and extract the beneficial compounds in plants that have traditionally been known to have medicinal benefits. We also focus our research on the seed selection and planting technologies for greater yield of leaves and seeds from the plants as well as the most efficient method to isolate and extract nervonic acid from seed oil.
 
We maintain research and product development facilities in China. We have a staff of 29 employees engaged in research and development of new technologies and resulting products. We also maintain close ties to the research staffs at Tsinghua University, China Agriculture University, Shandong Herbal Medicine University, and the Shandong Herbal Medicine Research Institute. We entered into a written R&D Cooperation Agreement with Nanjing Forestry University on August 10, 2016, which will be effective until July 31, 2019, pursuant to which we will invest in a national herbal R&D center with Nanjing Forestry University and have the right of first refusal on the transfer and use of Nanjing Forestry University's herbal related technologies. Nanjing Forest University provides assistance regarding selective breeding of the acer truncatum bunge trees and product development of acer trumcatum.
 
We also work to identify and assess innovative technologies developed by third parties for potential licensing or supply arrangements. Because of the nature of our distribution channel, which allows us to provide a high level of product information on a person-to-person basis, we have third parties who are interested in licensing innovative technologies to us to incorporate into our products and commercialize through our distribution channel. Licensing arrangements allow us to leverage the research activities of third parties that have resulted in demonstrated technologies, without all of the upfront costs and uncertainty associated with internal development. We have also invested in acquisitions to supplement our research capabilities and to acquire technologies.
 
During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, we spent $492,078 and $809,485 in research and development. Our R&D expenses were primarily used for acquiring and testing raw material, and also the ordinary maintenance expense for our research equipment.  In March 2017, we acquired research equipment that will be used for developing an enhanced manufacturing process for our acer truncatum bunge seed oil.     
 

During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, we spent $492,078 and $809,485 on research and development. Our R&D expenses were primarily used for acquiring and testing raw material, and also the ordinary maintenance expense for our research equipment. The R&D expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 included the payment of $267,425 for personnel costs and $221,047 for raw materials used in R&D of ginkgo biloba brain tablets. In March 2017, we acquired research equipment that will be used for developing an enhanced manufacturing process for our acer truncatum bunge seed oil.
 
Certifications
 
The manufacturing facility developed by Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical has received GMP (good manufacturing practices) certification granted by the Chinese government. GMP is the only certified manufacturing standard certificate that is authorized by the Chinese government. Only companies that pass GMP standards and obtain the certificate that is issued by Chinese government are able to manufacture medicines and related products. We have also achieved ISO9000 certification for our manufacturing processes.  We received quality standard certification for acre truncatum bunge seed oil granted by the state Food and Drug Administration on February 13, 2015.
 
The farm operated by Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical is operated in a manner consistent with the requirements for organic certification set up by the China Organic Foods Development Center. The health products manufactured have been certified as "green" by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture in 2006, which reflects the Company's dedication to organic agricultural methods.

Manufacturing, and Raw Material Supplies
 
We manufacture and package the Huoliyuan capsules and acer truncatum bunge seed oils products. Raw materials and packaging component, are purchased from several suppliers. Packages of the Huoliyuan capsules and acer truncatum bunge seed oils products, consisting of containers and packaging components, are purchased from various third-party suppliers. We design the brochures that are used by the representatives to sell our acer truncatum bunge seed oils products through our direct marketing channel.
 
We believe that we can continue to obtain sufficient raw materials and supplies to manufacture and produce our Huoliyuan capsules and acer truncatum bunge seed oils products for the foreseeable future.


Competition
 We face significant competition in all of our product lines.
 Acer Truncatum Bunge Seed Oil Products
  While we believe that we are the largest producer of pure oil for use as a health supplement, other significant competitors include Weifang Luyuan Bio-technology Co. Ltd. and Liaoning Sanmark Co. Ltd.  There are also many small producers. While we will be one of the few vertically integrated producers that also produce their own raw material once our trees begin to mature in the fall of 2018, other producers are also planting acer truncatum bunge planting bases.  We also face competition from producers of other oils used as health supplements. 
 While we intend to enter the market for an edible oil product, Jinlongyu, Fulinmen and Luhua are the first tier brands, accounting for approximately 70% of the sales volume of small-packaged edible oil in 2017, "Shengzhou", "Jiusan"," Duoli", "Xiwang" and "Changshou Hua" are the principal second tier brands and other regional edible oil brands in the third tier. Most of the first tier brands offer several categories of edible oil, which include blended oil, rapeseed oil, rice oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, camellia oil and olive oil. Lower tier brands offer oils of lower quality.

Huoliyuan Capsules
 There are currently 14 pharmaceutical companies that produce Huoliyuan tablets in China. We are the only company that produces Huoliyuan capsules. We believe that we are the largest producer of Houliyuan medicine in China.  During the years 2013 to 2015, the market shares of the capsule/tablet market of each of our 13 competitors ranged between 1% and 13% while our market share was 27%. The only competitors with more than a 10% market share were Jilin Yinglian Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Hezhi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
 We believe we achieved this success by virtue of our dosage, the advantages of selling a capsule as well as a tablet, and, efficacy and quality advantages.
Health Care Products
 Our industry is very competitive and the barriers to entry are not significant. We compete with manufacturers, distributors, and retailers of nutritional products in many channels, including direct sales, specialty retail stores, wholesale stores, and the Internet generally. We also compete with other public and privately owned direct sellers for distributor talent, including for example Amway, Herbalife, and Nu Skin. On both fronts, some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are, have a longer operating history, higher visibility and name recognition, and greater financial resources than we do.
Employees
 Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical employed 313 individuals, each on a full-time basis, as of June 15, 2018, of which 24 employees are involved in administration; 42 are dedicated to marketing and other functions, and 29 to research and development. The remaining employees is involved in manufacturing. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.

 Distribution Channel
 
Huoliyuan Capsule
 
We sell the Huoliyuan capsules to our three major distributors, which in turn distribute the Huoliyuan capsules to multiple other distributors or sell the Huoliyuan capsules to the final point of use (e.g. hospital, pharmacy, clinic). We are required by law to sell the product through third party distributors as it is classified as a prescription medication.
 
Acer Truncatum Bunge Seed Oil Products, and other products from Shandong Yongchuntang
 
Our use of the direct sales channel enables us to build a larger customer base and increase the sales of health care products. In May 2015, we received a sublicense from Shandong Yongchuntang to sell Shandong Yongchuntang's products using the direct-sales license issued to Shandong Yongchuntang by the government.  We are also permitted by Shandong Yongchuntang to sell our acer truncatum bunge seed oil products using this license.
 
Unlike most of our consumer packaged goods competitors, which sell their products through third-party retail establishments (e.g., drug stores and department stores), we sell our acer truncatum bunge seed oils products, and other products from Shandong Yongchuntang to the ultimate consumer through the direct-selling channel. Sales of our products are made to the ultimate consumer principally through direct selling by representatives, who are not our employees.


Our distribution channel is composed of two primary groups: our consumer group—individuals who buy the products we sell primarily for personal or family consumption; and our sales network—representatives who personally buy, use and resell products, and who also find new consumers, and recruit, train and develop new sellers. We strive to develop both our consumer group and our sales network. Our strategy for growing our consumer group is to offer high-quality, innovative products that provide demonstrable benefits. Our strategy for growing our sales network is to provide a meaningful business opportunity for those persons who demonstrate the ability to develop both a consumer group and a team of sellers, including through sales compensation and incentives.
 
Our in-house marketing staff supervises major dealers, who sub-distribute through nationwide networks, which allows us to accomplish broad geographic distribution with a marketing staff of eight people, thus keeping our overhead low. We have general dealer agreements with seven major dealers in different regions of China to control our direct sales force, covering a total of 33 provinces. The major dealers are rewarded primarily based on total sales achieved in their zones or downline team of recruited, trained and managed representatives. The primary responsibilities of the dealers are the prospecting, appointing, training and developing their downline representatives while maintaining a certain level of their own sales. Personal contacts, including recommendations from current representatives, and local market advertising constitute the primary means of obtaining new representatives.
 
The direct selling program gives representatives the opportunity to earn discounts on their own sales of our products, as well as commissions based on the net sales made by representatives they have recruited and trained. This program limits the number of levels on which commissions can be earned to three.
 
Development of the direct sales program throughout China is one part of our long-term growth strategy. Given the high rate of turnover among representatives, which is a common characteristic of direct selling, it is critical that a major dealer recruit, retain and service representatives on a continuing basis in order to maintain and grow our business.
  17
 
We currently have approximately 200,000 active representatives overseen by our seven major dealers.  Representatives earn by purchasing products directly from us at a discount from a published brochure price and selling them to their customers, the ultimate consumer of our products. Representatives can start their businesses for a nominal fee, or in some markets, for no fee at all. We generally have no arrangements with end users of our products beyond the representative.
 
A representative contacts their customers directly, selling primarily through our web-enabled systems, which highlights our products. In this sense, the representative, together with web-enabled systems, are the "store" through which our products are sold. The order is processed and the products are assembled at a distribution center and delivered to the representative through China National Post Logistic, with whom we have a strategic relationship, to deliver our products to our customers. China National Post Logistic is a subsidiary of China Post.
 
We employ certain web-enabled systems to increase representative support, which allow a representative to run her or his business efficiently and also allow us to improve our order-processing accuracy. Representatives can use the Internet to manage their business electronically, including order submission, order tracking, payment and communications with us.
 Seasonality
 
Although we are not significantly affected by seasonality, the fourth quarter is our peak season for sales of acer truncatum bunge based products because of purchases related to the Chinese New Year holiday season that effectively lasts more than two weeks. Gift giving during the holiday season is customary.
Regulation
  
Our business is subject to various laws and regulations, particularly with respect to our direct selling business models and our product categories. In addition, as a United States entity operating through subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions, we are subject to foreign exchange control that regulates the flow of funds between us and our subsidiary. If we were to sell our products overseas, we may also be subject to customs duties and other regulations of the importing country.
Direct Selling Regulations
 
 Direct selling is regulated by national, provincial and local government agencies in China. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, including "pyramid" schemes, which compensate participants primarily for recruiting additional participants without significant emphasis on product sales to consumers.
 
The regulatory environment in China is particularly complex and continues to evolve. China's direct selling and anti-pyramiding regulations contain various restrictions, including a prohibition on the payment of multi-level compensation. The regulations are subject to discretionary interpretation by provincial and local level regulators as well as local customs and practices.
 
Regulators continue to act cautiously as they monitor the development of direct selling in China. As of June 29, 2018, Shandong Yongchuntang has obtained direct selling licenses in six provinces and municipalities in China all of which we have the exclusive right to use under our supply agreement with Shandong Yongchuntang. In order to expand our direct selling model into additional provinces, Shandong Yongchuntang currently must obtain a series of approvals from the local Department of Commerce in such provinces, the Sishui Municipal Commission of Commerce (our supervisory authority), as well as the State Ministry of Commerce ("MOFCOM"), which is the national governmental authority overseeing direct selling. In the course of obtaining these approvals, the respective authorities under MOFCOM must also consult and seek opinions on our business operations from the Ministry of Public Security and the Administration for Industry and Commerce at both provincial and State levels.
 
China impose limits on the amount of commissions we can pay to our representatives. For example, under regulations in China, direct selling companies may pay independent direct sellers in China up to a maximum 30% of the revenue they generate through their own sales of products to consumers.
  18
 

 Food Regulations
 
The manufacture of edible oils in China requires government approval.  As we expand our line of products based on acer truncatum bunge seed oil to include edible oils, on January 11, 2018, we were issued a Food Production License for production of edible vegetable oil, which includes acer truncatum bunge seed oil, and related blended edible oil products. The license was granted by the Food and Drug Administration of Sishui County and is valid for five years.
Regulations Relating to Pharmaceutical Industry
 The Huoliyuan capsule is classified as a medicine in China that can only be purchased by prescription. As a result, we are subject to regulations applicable to the pharmaceutical industry.  The pharmaceutical industry in China, including the traditional Chinese medicine sector, is highly regulated. The primary regulatory authority is the SFDA, including its provincial and local branches. As a developer, producer and distributor of medicinal products, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the SFDA and its provincial and local branches. The law of the PRC on the Administration of Pharmaceuticals provides the basic legal framework for the administration of the production and sale of pharmaceuticals in China and covers the manufacturing, distributing, packaging, pricing and advertising of pharmaceutical products. Its implementing regulations set forth detailed rules with respect to the administration of pharmaceuticals in China. We are also subject to other PRC laws and regulations that are applicable to business operators, manufacturers and distributors in general.
 
Registration and Approval of Medicine
 A medicine must be registered and approved by the SFDA before it can be manufactured. The registration and approval process requires the manufacturer to submit to the SFDA a registration application containing detailed information concerning the efficacy and quality of the medicine and the manufacturing process and the production facilities the manufacturer expects to use. This process generally takes at least a few months and could be longer, depending on the nature of the medicine under review, the quality of the data provided and the workload of the SFDA. To obtain the SFDA registration and approval necessary for commencing production, the manufacturer is also required to conduct pre-clinical trials, apply to the SFDA for permission to conduct clinical trials, and, after clinical trials are completed, file clinical data with the SFDA for approval.
 New Medicine.    If a medicine is approved by the SFDA as a new medicine, the SFDA will issue a new medicine certificate to the manufacturer and impose a monitoring period of as long as five years. The length of the monitoring period is specified in the new medicine certificate. During the monitoring period, the SFDA will monitor the safety of the new medicine, and will neither accept new medicine certificate applications for an identical medicine by another pharmaceutical company, nor approve the production or import of an identical medicine by other pharmaceutical companies. For new medicines approved prior to 2002, the monitoring period could be longer than five years. As a result of these regulations, the holder of a new medicine certificate effectively has the exclusive right to manufacture the new medicine during the monitoring period. However, even though our new medicine certificate for Huoliyuan capsules has expired, as we are in the transitional period described below, we continue to have the exclusive right to produce the Huoliyuan capsules.
 Provisional National Production Standard.    In connection with the SFDA's approval of a new medicine, the SFDA will normally direct the manufacturer to produce the medicine according to a provisional national production standard, or a provisional standard. A provisional standard is valid for two years, during which the SFDA closely monitors the production process and quality consistency of the medicine to develop a national final production standard for the medicine, or a final standard. Three months before the expiration of the two-year period, the manufacturer is required to apply to the SFDA to convert the provisional standard to a final standard. Upon approval, the SFDA will publish the final standard for the production of this medicine. There is no statutory timeline for the SFDA to complete its review and grant approval for the conversion. In practice, the approval for conversion to a final standard is time-consuming and could take a few years. However, during the SFDA's review period, the manufacturer may continue to produce the medicine according to the provisional standard.
  19
 
Transitional Period.    Prior to the latter of (1) the expiration of a new medicine's monitoring period or (2) the date when the SFDA grants a final standard for a new medicine after the expiration of the provisional standard, the SFDA will not accept applications for an identical medicine nor will it approve the production of an identical medicine by other pharmaceutical companies. Accordingly, the manufacturer will continue to have an exclusive production right for the new medicine during this transitional period.
 For example, although the new medicine certificates for Huoliyuan capsules have already expired, we continue to have the exclusive right to produce and sell Huoliyuan capsules until the SFDA approves the final standards for this medicine, the timing of which is uncertain.
 
Continuing SFDA Regulation
 Pharmaceutical manufacturers in China are subject to continuing regulation by the SFDA. If an approved medicine, its labeling or its manufacturing process is significantly modified, a new pre-market approval or pre-market approval supplement will be required by the SFDA. A pharmaceutical manufacturer is subject to periodic inspection and safety monitoring by the SFDA to determine compliance with regulatory requirements. The SFDA has a variety of enforcement actions available to enforce its regulations and rules, including fines and injunctions, recall or seizure of products, the imposition of operating restrictions, partial suspension or complete shutdown of production and criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical Product Manufacturing
 Permits and Licenses for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers.    A pharmaceutical manufacturer must obtain a pharmaceutical manufacturing permit from the SFDA's relevant provincial branch. This permit is valid for five years and is renewable upon its expiration. Our current pharmaceutical manufacturing permit, issued by the SFDA, will expire on December 31, 2020. We do not currently anticipate any difficulty renewing our pharmaceutical manufacturing permit.
 Good Manufacturing Practice.    A pharmaceutical manufacturer must meet the Good Manufacturing Practice standards, or GMP standards, for each of its production facilities in China in respect of each form of pharmaceutical products it produces. GMP standards include staff qualifications, production premises and facilities, equipment, raw materials, environmental hygiene, production management, quality control and customer complaint administration. If a manufacturer meets the GMP standards, the SFDA will issue to the manufacturer a Good Manufacturing Practice certificate, or a GMP certificate, with a five-year validity period. However, for a newly established pharmaceutical manufacturer that meets the GMP standards, the SFDA will issue a GMP certificate with only a one-year validity period.
 We have obtained a GMP certificate for all of our production facilities for the Huoliyuan capsules. On June 10, 2008, we obtained a GMP certificate for our facility for the manufacturing of medicine in the forms of tablets and capsules. The certificate was renewed in 2013 and will expire on November 27, 2018. We do not anticipate any difficulty in renewing these certificates.
 
Price Controls
 The retail prices of prescription and OTC medicines that are included in the national medicine catalog are subject to price controls administered by the Price Control Office under the National Development and Reform Commission, or the NDRC, and provincial price control authorities, either in the form of fixed prices or price ceilings. The controls over the retail price of a medicine effectively set the limits for the wholesale price of that medicine. From time to time, the NDRC publishes and updates a national list of medicines that are subject to price control. Fixed prices and price ceilings on medicines are determined based on profit margins that the NDRC deems reasonable, the type and quality of the medicine, its production costs, the prices of substitute medicines and the extent of the manufacturer's compliance with the applicable GMP standards. The NDRC directly regulates the price of some of the medicines on the list, and delegates the power to provincial price control authorities to regulate the remainder on the list. For those medicines under the authority of provincial price control authorities, each provincial price control authority regulates medicines manufactured by manufacturers registered in that province. Provincial price control authorities have the discretion to authorize price adjustments based on the local conditions and the level of local economic development.
  20
 
Only the manufacturer of a medicine may apply for an increase in the retail price of the medicine and it must apply either to the NDRC, if the price of the medicine is nationally regulated, or to the provincial price control authorities in the province where it is registered, if the price of the medicine is provincially regulated. For a provincially regulated medicine, when provincial price control authorities approve an application, they will file the new approved price with the NDRC for confirmation and thereafter the newly approved price will become binding and enforceable across China.
 The retail prices of our Huoliyuan capsules fall under the direct regulation of the Shandong provincial price control authorities. We have discretion to determine the retail prices of the nine products we distribute for Shandong Yongchuntang as well as our acer truncatum bunge seed oil products.
 
Reimbursement under the National Medical Insurance Program
 
Accrding to the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China, as of the end of 2017, over 1.35 billion people were enrolled into the National Medical Insurance Program. The Ministry of Labor and Social Security, together with other government authorities, determines which medicines are to be included in or removed from the national medicine catalog for the National Medical Insurance Program, and under which tier a medicine should fall, both of which affect the amounts reimbursable to program participants for their purchases of those medicines. These determinations are based on a number of factors, including price and efficacy. A National Medical Insurance Program participant can be reimbursed for the full cost of a Tier 1 medicine and 80-90% of the cost of a Tier 2 medicine. Although it is designated as a national program, the implementation of the National Medical Insurance Program is delegated to various provincial governments, each of which has established its own medicine catalog. A provincial government must include all Tier 1 medicines listed in the national medicine catalog in its provincial medicine catalog, but may use its discretion based on its own selection criteria to add other medicines to, or exclude Tier 2 medicines listed in the national medicine catalog from, its provincial medicine catalog, so long as the combined numbers of the medicines added and excluded do not exceed 15% of the number of the Tier 2 medicines listed in the national catalog. In addition, provincial governments may use their discretion to upgrade a nationally classified Tier 2 medicine to Tier 1 in their provincial medicine catalogs, but may not downgrade a nationally classified Tier 1 medicine to Tier 2. Huoliyuan capsules are in the provincial medicine catalogs of 30 provinces.
 The total amount of reimbursement for the cost of prescription and OTC medicines, in addition to other medical expenses, for an individual program participant in a calendar year is capped at the amount in that participant's individual account. The amount in a participant's account varies, depending upon the amount of contributions from the participant and his or her employer. Generally, on average, program participants who are from relatively wealthier eastern parts of China and relatively wealthier metropolitan centers have greater amounts in their individual accounts than those from less developed provinces.   
 
Other Regulations
 In addition to the regulations relating to pharmaceutical industry in China, our operating subsidiary is also subject to the regulations applicable to a foreign invested enterprise in China.
Foreign Currency Exchange
 Pursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration Rules promulgated in 1996 and amended in 1997 and various regulations issued by State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or the SAFE, and other relevant PRC government authorities, the Renminbi is freely convertible only to the extent of current account items, such as trade-related receipts and payments, interest and dividends. Capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investment, require the prior approval from the SAFE or its local counterpart for conversion of Renminbi into a foreign currency, such as U.S. dollars, and remittance of the foreign currency outside the PRC.
 Payments for transactions that take place within the PRC must be made in Renminbi. Unless otherwise approved, PRC companies other than foreign investment vehicles must convert foreign currency payments they receive from abroad into Renminbi. On the other hand, foreign investment vehicles may retain foreign exchange in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks, subject to a cap set by the SAFE or its local counterpart.
  21
 
Foreign Exchange Registration of Offshore Investment by PRC Residents
 Pursuant to SAFE's Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents to Engage in Financing and Inbound Investment Through Overseas Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular No. 75, issued on October 21, 2005, (1) a PRC resident must register with a local branch of the SAFE before he or she establishes or controls an overseas special purpose vehicle, or SPV, for the purpose of overseas equity financing (including convertible debt financing); (2) when a PRC resident contributes the assets of or his or her equity interests in a domestic enterprise into an SPV or engages in overseas financing after contributing assets or equity interests into an SPV, such PRC resident must register his or her interest in the SPV and the change thereof with the local branch of the SAFE; and (3) when the SPV undergoes a material change outside of China, such as a change in share capital, a merger or an acquisition, the PRC resident must, within 30 days from the occurrence of the event that triggers such change, register such change with a local branch of the SAFE. PRC residents who are stockholders of SPVs established before November 1, 2005 were required to register with a local branch of the SAFE before March 31, 2006.
 Under SAFE Circular No. 75, failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth above may result in penalties, including imposition of restrictions on a PRC subsidiary's foreign exchange activities and its ability to distribute dividends to the SPV.
 Our principal beneficial owners who are PRC residents have registered with the local branch of the SAFE as required under SAFE Circular No. 75.
 
Dividend Distribution
 The principal regulations governing dividend distributions by wholly foreign-owned enterprises and Sino-foreign equity joint ventures include:
 

• | Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law (1986), as amended;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law Implementing Rules (1990), as amended;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law (1979), as amended; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law Implementing Rules (1983), as amended.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under these regulations, wholly foreign-owned enterprises and Sino-foreign equity joint ventures in the PRC may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Additionally, these foreign-invested enterprises are required to set aside certain amounts of their accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.
 
Patents
 There are three types of patents under the PRC patent law. The first type, an external design patent, refers to a new design of a product's shape, pattern or a combination of shape and pattern and the combination of a product's color and its shape and pattern, where such a design is aesthetically appealing and suitable for industrial application. The second type of patent is called an invention patent and the third type of patent is referred to as a new model or utility patent. Invention patents and utility patents are similar in that both of them relate to scientific or technological inventions. A utility patent, compared to an invention patent, requires a lower level of creativity and covers a narrower scope. In addition, an invention patent can be a new technology introduced in respect of an existing product, method or their improvements, while a utility patent is restricted to a product's shape, constitutions or a combination of these two. Invention patents are valid for 20 years, whereas utility patents and external design patents are each valid for 10 years.
