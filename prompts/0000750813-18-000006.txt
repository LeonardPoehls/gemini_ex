Item 1. Business
General
We are a leading provider of onshore seismic data to the oil and gas industry in North America. We own an extensive library of onshore and offshore geological data that we have accumulated since our inception in 1982. We believe our data library is one of the largest onshore three-dimensional (“3D”) databases available for licensing in North America and includes leading positions in oil, liquids-rich and natural gas unconventional plays as well as conventional areas. 
As of February 2018, we own approximately 46,900 square miles of onshore 3D data, consisting of 32,800 square miles in the United States (70%) and 14,100 square miles in Canada (30%). We have a leading market position in key geographies in the North American unconventional onshore oil and gas plays where exploration and production (“E&P”) companies have been focusing their efforts in recent years. Approximately 56% of our onshore 3D library is comprised of data located in unconventional plays. We have expanded our data library coverage into Mexico through the reprocessing of existing two-dimensional (“2D”) data which can be licensed to E&P companies. We have approximately 17,300 linear miles (9,200 net linear miles to our revenue interest) of reprocessed 2D Mexico data available for licensing, of which we have completed the processing for approximately 9,200 linear miles (4,600 net) with the remaining approximately 8,100 linear miles (4,600 net) in progress. 
Our business model is to acquire data selectively in geological formations that we believe will support drilling from a variety of oil and gas producers over an extended period of time. We design and manage new surveys and license them to initial clients which typically fund a significant portion (55% to 75%) of the total cost of each survey (referred to as “client underwriting”). Seitel typically owns 100% of the acquired data and licenses the data to additional parties on a non-exclusive basis (referred to as “resales”). Such resales are unlimited in both time and amount and require minimal incremental cash costs. Since embarking on our investment in unconventional data in 2008, we have achieved, on a historical basis, a payback period on these 
3

investments of about three to four years on average despite some slowdown in returns during the recent industry downturn. Our long-lived, diverse data library built over three decades continues to provide value to our customers, with 37% of our 2017 3D onshore resale revenue coming from data over five years old.
We believe that we have low fixed costs and a highly flexible operating model, as we do not own any seismic survey equipment or directly employ field personnel. Instead, we outsource those functions by contracting with third-party specialists, as required, in various facets of the data acquisition process in order to complete surveys to expand our data library. We also use sales commissions to create incentives for our sales force while matching our costs to our achieved sales. We believe this business model provides enhanced flexibility, allowing us to optimize our level of investment for the market environment and resulting in substantially lower cash flow volatility by enabling us to respond quickly to changes in demand and shifts in client geographic focus.
We serve a market which includes over 1,500 companies in the oil and gas industry. Our customers include independent oil and gas companies, major integrated oil and gas companies and national oil companies, as well as small and mid-cap E&P companies and private prospect generating individuals. The importance of geological data in the exploration and development process drives demand for data in our library. Specifically, our customers use seismic data to identify geographical areas where subsurface conditions are favorable for oil and gas exploration and to optimize development and production of oil and gas reserves. Seismic data provides valuable insight for operators including a target zone's thickness, as well as faulting pattern complexity, helping with the design of horizontal drilling programs and minimizing the potential for uneconomic wells.
To support our seismic data licensing business and our clients, we maintain warehouse and electronic storage facilities at our Houston, Texas headquarters and our Calgary, Alberta locations. Through our Seitel Solutions business unit (“Solutions”), we offer the ability to access and interact with the seismic data we own and market via a standard web browser and the Internet.
From 2015 through 2017, approximately 98% of our revenues were generated from customers underwriting data acquisitions and revenue from licensing of seismic data. Other revenues during these years were primarily derived from Solutions for reproduction and delivery of seismic data licensed by our clients. See Note L to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our revenue by geographical area.
We are a private company controlled by ValueAct Capital Master Fund, L.P. and funds managed by affiliates of Centerbridge Partners, L.P. We are incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are in Houston, Texas.
Description of Operations
Seismic Data
E&P companies consider seismic data an important tool in finding and exploiting hydrocarbons. E&P companies use seismic data in oil and gas exploration and development efforts to increase the probability of drilling success, to better delineate existing oil and gas fields and to augment their reservoir completion and management techniques. In unconventional plays, E&P companies use seismic data as a development tool to better identify efficient drilling plans and maximize production by identifying and understanding a series of critical characteristics of the targeted resource. The cost of seismic data represents a small portion of the total cost of most projects, but provides substantial benefits to operators. 3D seismic data provides a graphic depiction of the earth’s subsurface from two horizontal dimensions and one vertical dimension, rendering a more detailed picture than 2D data, which presents a cross-sectional view from one vertical and one horizontal dimension. The more comprehensive geophysical information provided by 3D surveys significantly enhances an interpreter’s ability to evaluate the probability of the existence and location of oil and gas deposits as well as the target zone’s thickness and faulting pattern complexity. However, the cost to create 3D seismic data is significantly more than the cost to create 2D seismic data. As a result, 2D data continues to be used by clients for preliminary, broad-scale exploration evaluation, as well as in determining the location and design of 3D surveys. 3D surveys can then be used for more detailed analysis to maximize actual drilling potential and success.
Although we amortize our seismic data library investment over a maximum period of four years, much of our seismic data has continued to generate licensing revenue past the amortization period. Assuming the data is sampled and gathered adequately in the field recording phase, it is amenable to re-evaluation and re-presentation multiple times, using new or alternate processing techniques or updated knowledge of the Earth model.
Management believes the level of resales from various vintages of our seismic data is useful in assessing the resiliency and value of our seismic data library. Management considers estimated longevity of and foreseeable demand for data in determining 
4

whether to undertake new data acquisition projects. For the year ended December 31, 2017, resale revenue from 3D onshore data was recognized from net historical investments made in the indicated periods (in thousands):

 | ResaleRevenue | | Percentage | | NetInvestment (1) | | Percentage

(1) | The net book value of our 3D onshore data included in the table above was $65.8 million at December 31, 2017. However, we believe that the presentation of historical net investment, a non-GAAP measure that reflects total data cost less client underwriting before fair value adjustments resulting from the 2007 merger between Seitel Acquisition Corp. with and into Seitel, Inc. (the “Merger”), is important as it reflects our capital investment in our seismic data library net of the portion underwritten by our customers. The GAAP measure to which historical net investment is most directly comparable is net book value. For a reconciliation of historical net investment to net book value, see “Reconciliation of Historical Net Investment to Net Book Value” below.

Data Library Overview
We believe our data library is one of the largest onshore 3D databases available for licensing in North America. We have built our onshore 3D library over more than 20 years with approximately $1.9 billion in gross investments and we view our library as an asset that would be time- and cost-prohibitive for others to replicate. Approximately 56% of our onshore 3D library is comprised of data located in unconventional plays. We believe we are well positioned due to the geographic diversity of our data library, including data in oil-focused and liquids-rich plays such as the Eagle Ford/Woodbine, Permian, Niobrara/Bakken, Anadarko Basin, Montney and Duvernay and in natural gas-focused plays such as the Haynesville, Louisiana Cotton Valley, Utica/Marcellus and Horn River, with over 26,000 miles of data in unconventional areas. 
Our library also consists of data targeted at conventional plays in both the U.S. and Canada. We also own a library of 3D offshore data covering parts of the shelf and certain deep water areas in the Western and Central U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we own or manage approximately 1.1 million linear miles of 2D data concentrated primarily in North America, both onshore and offshore. 
5

We have expanded our data library coverage into Mexico by reprocessing existing onshore 2D data owned by the Mexican government and we have the right to license the reprocessed data to E&P companies.
The following table describes our 3D seismic data library as of February 12, 2018:

Our data library is a highly valuable asset that has historically generated strong returns on capital. The technical and informational usefulness of our data has generally not declined over time. Demand for data is driven by the level and location of customer exploration and development activity and not the age of the data. Because of our positioning in favorable geographies and the long life of the data, we believe there is significant built-in potential for repeat licensing of data at little or no marginal cost. The existing library is highly defensible as the customer’s cost of licensing data is typically much lower than the cost of creating a new survey. We believe there is little incentive for competitors to survey areas where we already have data.
Onshore U.S. and Canada: Since 2008, our capital investment in both the U.S. and Canada has been focused on unconventional plays, initially in the shale gas areas and, since 2011, shifting towards oil-focused and liquids-rich objectives. These changes in focus are made in accordance with the activity of our clients and our ability to shift with them is an important component of our growth strategy.
The U.S. onshore 3D conventional sector of our seismic data library is mainly comprised of our Gulf Coast Texas and southern Louisiana/Mississippi components, which we began accumulating in 1993. We also have relatively small amounts of 3D seismic data in other areas, such as Alabama, California, Michigan and Northern Louisiana as well as an extensive 2D data library that continues to contribute to our licensing sales.
6

The Canadian onshore 3D conventional sector of our seismic data library is mainly comprised of data within the Western Canadian Basin, which we began accumulating in 1998. We also have an extensive 2D data library that continues to contribute to our licensing sales.
Offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico: Our library of offshore data covers parts of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico shelf and certain deep water areas in the Western and Central U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We accumulated the majority of our U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore 3D data from 1993 to 2000 and have not made any substantial additions to our offshore data library since that time.
Mexico: We are building our Mexico data library initially by reprocessing existing 2D data owned by the Mexican government and we have the right to license the reprocessed data to E&P companies. As of February 12, 2018, we have completed the reprocessing of approximately 9,200 2D linear miles (4,600 linear miles net to our revenue interest) in four areas and have been granted approvals for and are currently reprocessing four additional areas totaling approximately 8,100 linear miles (4,600 net linear miles). The net linear miles represent our net 50% revenue interest in certain areas after taking into consideration an alliance agreement entered into in 2017.
Data Library Growth
We regularly add to our library of seismic data by: (1) recording new data, (2) buying ownership of existing data for cash, (3) obtaining ownership of existing data through non-monetary exchanges and (4) creating new value-added products from data existing within our library.
Underwritten Data Acquisitions: We design and manage new seismic surveys that are specifically suited to the geology and environmental conditions of the area using the most appropriate technology available. Typically, one or more customers will underwrite or fund a significant portion of the direct cost in exchange for a license or licenses to use the resulting data. Under the terms of these licenses, the customers may occasionally have a limited exclusivity period. We consider the contracts executed up to the time we make a firm commitment to create the new seismic survey as underwriting or pre-funding. Any subsequent licensing of the data while the survey is in progress or once it is completed is considered a resale license. All of our new data acquisition activity during 2017 occurred in unconventional plays, primarily the EagleFord/Woodbine, Permian and Louisiana Cotton Valley in the U.S. and both Montney and Duvernay in Western Canada. All field work on these projects is outsourced to subcontractors. A significant percentage of the data processing for our U.S. and Canadian projects is processed by our internal data processing group located in Houston. We employ experienced geoscientists who design seismic programs and oversee field acquisition and data processing to ensure the quality and longevity of the data created.
Cash Purchases: We purchase data for cash from oil and gas companies, other seismic companies or financial investors in seismic data when opportunities arise that meet our investment criteria.
Non-Monetary Exchanges: We grant a non-exclusive license to selected data from our library, provide reproduction services or provide data processing services (or some combination of those items) to our customers in exchange for ownership of seismic data from that customer. The data that we receive is distinct from the data that is licensed to our customer. These transactions will tend to be for individual surveys or groups of surveys, rather than whole libraries. Occasionally, we also use non-monetary exchanges in conjunction with data acquisitions and cash purchases. In addition, we may receive advanced data processing services on certain existing data in exchange for a nonexclusive license to selected data from our library.
Value-Added Products: We create new products from existing seismic surveys in our library by extracting a variety of additional information from these surveys that was not readily apparent in the initial products. Opportunities to extract such additional information and create such additional products may result from information from secondary sources, alternative conclusions regarding the initial products and applying alternate or more complex processes to the initial products, or some combination of these factors. Additional products may include 5D Interpolation, Pre-Stack Depth Migration volumes, Amplitude Versus Offset volumes, Complex Attribute volumes and Rock Property volumes. The cost of these products may be underwritten by one or more customers in exchange for a license or licenses to use the resulting data or we may determine to fund the cost of certain of these products based on anticipated demand by our clients. These data products are licensed to the industry on a non-exclusive basis. Work on these projects may be performed by our internal data processing groups, outsourced to specific specialists in the arena or conducted under an alliance with a particular specialist. We employ experienced geoscientists who design these value-added products and oversee the processing to ensure the quality and longevity of the data created.

Competitive Strengths
We believe we have the following competitive strengths: 
Large and Diverse Data Library with Leading Market Position in Key Oil and Gas Producing Regions: We believe we have one of the largest onshore 3D seismic data libraries available for licensing in North America. Our data covers a diverse range of oil and gas producing regions in the United States and Canada and we believe it provides us with leading positions in oil, liquids-rich and natural gas unconventional plays as well as conventional areas. As of February 2018, we have over 26,000 square miles of unconventional 3D data. As industry activity dictates, we will focus on further development of existing plays where our clients are active. Our competitive advantage is driven by our ability to: 

• | successfully bid for new seismic surveys that are in our areas of focus as a result of our knowledge of data return characteristics for similar data in our existing library;


• | creatively market our data library with an innovative strategy, which includes tailoring licenses to meet our clients’ needs;


• | generate client trust by delivering surveys on time that meet oil and gas client requirements particularly those clients that are early participants; and


• | retain and grow valuable client relationships.

With one of the largest onshore seismic data libraries in the active North American oil and natural gas basins, we have an established competitive position. Since 1994, we have invested more than $2.1 billion to build our data library, with a gross investment of approximately $1.9 billion, $0.8 billion net of underwriting, in onshore 3D data. We believe that the current replacement cost of our seismic library significantly exceeds our original investment, and that our broad geographic coverage and strong presence in the active North American onshore oil and gas basins coupled with our domain expertise creates significant barriers to replication and a defensible market position. We believe competitors will generally not shoot over areas already in our library because it is not economically viable to do so. 
Multiple Revenue Opportunities Lead to Strong Returns on New and Existing Data: We derive revenue from the non-exclusive licensing of our data. Importantly, data within our library can be licensed on a non-exclusive basis multiple times over a span of many years with minimal incremental costs, if any. Several factors contribute to the licensing of individual surveys multiple times which drives high returns on our investments over time. An area captured by a 3D survey may have multiple mineral holders within a particular stratigraphic layer as well as vertically across layers. Also, new oil and gas field discoveries, new drilling technologies and pipeline and oil and gas infrastructure expansion can cause renewed activity in a previously assessed surrounding area. In addition, due to the capital intensive nature of developing unconventional plays, many oil and gas companies seek partners to share in the cost of development and these partners will often need access to the same data, which will require them to purchase licenses for their own use. Furthermore, as a result of the restrictions on transfer contained in our license agreements, merger and acquisition activity often requires re-licensing of data following a change in field ownership. Moreover, prospective developers and investors without mineral rights may seek our data. 
We have proven our ability to license onshore data for extended periods after its creation. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 37% of total resale revenue for 3D onshore data came from data acquired before 2013. 
Ability to Adjust Quickly to Oil and Gas Industry Cycles: Our variable operating structure allows us to curtail overhead costs quickly during cyclical downturns in the oil and gas industry because we maintain a flexible, low cost structure with an efficient base of assets and employees. Our employee compensation structure is commission-based and bonus-centric and, unlike the majority of seismic companies, we do not own or operate seismic acquisition equipment or employ seismic acquisition crews, but instead engage, as required, third-party contractors with qualified equipment to shoot new data, which keeps our fixed operating expenses low. We believe this, in addition to the majority of our capital expenditures being discretionary, minimizes our ongoing capital requirements and results in substantially less volatility in cash flows by enabling us to respond quickly to changes in demand, and reduce capital expenditures when necessary. In addition, the creation of new surveys provides cost-effective growth opportunities because we impose strict capital investment thresholds with targeted underwriting levels averaging 60% to 70% and typically do not start work on new acquisition programs without an underwriting commitment. Additionally, we may seek higher levels of underwriting in order to minimize our cash investment while still adding new data to our library. For 2017, we achieved 92% average underwriting for new seismic acquisition projects. In 2016, underwriting revenue exceeded new seismic acquisition costs, resulting in an overall underwriting level of 113%. Average underwriting levels were 63% in 2015. 
Seismic Data Has an Attractive Value Proposition Among Our Blue Chip Customer Base: Our data is key to oil and gas exploration and development activity. Understanding geological structure maximizes production and returns on client investments; however, seismic data purchases represent a small fraction of total drilling and completion costs. We serve a 
8

market that includes over 1,500 companies in the oil and gas industry. Our customer base ranges from some of the largest independent oil companies in the world to small, single-basin E&P companies and also includes global oil and gas companies, typically with very little customer concentration. 
We believe that the quality of our data, the breadth of its coverage in the major active onshore basins in North America and our longstanding commitment to client service enables us to attract top-tier clients and maintain and grow existing client relationships. These relationships also create access to additional data surveys and sales opportunities.
Experienced Management Team: Our executive management team is comprised of individuals with an average of over 25 years of relevant experience. Robert Monson, our CEO and President, has more than 30 years of industry experience, while Marcia Kendrick, our CFO, joined us in 1993 and has over 25 years of industry experience. Richard Kelvin, our CTO and President of Seitel Canada Ltd. and Randy Sides, our President of Seitel Data, Ltd., both also have over 25 years of industry experience. Our expertise is in the selection, design and management of seismic surveys. We also employ an experienced sales and marketing group.
Corporate Strategy
Underwritten Data Acquisitions: We add data to our library primarily by contracting with third-party specialist service providers to create new subsurface geological data, which we design and own. Typically, one or more customers will underwrite or fund a significant portion of the direct cost of a seismic survey in exchange for a license or licenses to use the resulting data. The relatively high level of underwritten acquisition costs, typically 55% to 75% of the cost of the survey, lowers our initial capital requirements and enhances our return on investment. We maintain a disciplined return on investment approach to capital expenditures. We only intend to pursue new acquisition projects if we believe that conditions exist for repeated licensing of the same data over an extended period of time. We typically seek significant underwriting commitments before undertaking new acquisition projects as underwriting levels are generally a predictor of long-term demand for seismic data. We target an average of 60% to 70% underwriting level for all new seismic acquisition projects on an aggregate basis and may target higher underwriting levels in periods of industry downturn. We achieved 92% average underwriting levels for 2017 and achieved 113% and 63% average underwriting for new seismic acquisition projects in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, when acquiring 3D surveys, we consider the proximity to 3D surveys already in the library. We believe that there is greater value in contiguous data, or reasonably close concentrations of surveys in a single area. We typically own 100% of the acquired data and license the data to additional parties on a non-exclusive basis. Such resales are unlimited in both time and amount and require minimal incremental cash costs, if any. Our long-lived, diverse data library built over three decades continues to provide value to our customers, with 37% of our 2017 3D onshore resale revenue coming from data over five years old.
Provide Value to Customers through Deep Industry Knowledge and Technical Expertise: As a provider of multi-client data services, we deliver value to our clients through several aspects of our business. Our extensive expertise and local intelligence in designing and managing surveys is not generally available to our client base. We also create value-added products from the data in our library, primarily by applying complex imaging technology, such as complex depth imaging. These value-added products enhance the useful information that can be extracted from a given data set. As a large onshore data library owner, we have an existing data “footprint,” often providing further cost efficiencies and higher-quality data for new surveys. Clients are disposed to underwrite our surveys as the cost to license multi-client data is significantly less than the cost to commission a proprietary survey. Finally, our clients maintain anonymity both within the local community and amongst competitors through contracting with Seitel.
Expand Library in a Disciplined and Cost-effective Manner: The substantial majority of our library additions come from new seismic data creation. We also grow our data library through cash purchases of existing seismic data, non-monetary data exchanges and new value-added products created from existing data. We focus our data acquisition efforts on oil and natural gas producing areas that we believe are well suited to benefit from current and emerging trends in the E&P industry. The decision to make capital investments is weighed against the estimated length of the payback period and projected return on capital. We believe ample opportunities exist to grow our library in existing plays and, as oil and gas industry activity dictates, to expand into emerging areas. We use proprietary information tools and apply our management expertise to select among our pipeline of new survey opportunities. We typically pursue a new acquisition project only if it has a significant underwriting commitment from our customers and if we believe that conditions exist for repeated licensing of the data over an extended period of time. We are thorough in our evaluation of survey opportunities and are selective in adding prospective surveys to our pipeline and therefore not all surveys will meet our return requirements.
Leverage Internal Geophysical and Operations Management Expertise while Outsourcing Lower Margin Services: Our strong geophysical, technical and field operating management expertise is essential in maintaining our leadership through our 
9

ability to design surveys with attractive return potential and to manage their creation. We will continue to outsource the non-core, fixed-cost intensive services, including surveying, permitting and data capture involving field equipment and crews. This strategy enables us to select vendors that we believe offer the best price, equipment and skill sets for a particular environment, geographical location or geophysical objective and provides us with access to state-of-the-art equipment and emerging technologies. We believe this operating model also gives us the flexibility to control costs to respond appropriately to changing market conditions.
Maintain a Strong Balance Sheet and Ample Liquidity: We believe a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity are critical elements to managing the business through industry cycles. We intend to fund data acquisitions with the cash flow generated from operations.
Industry Overview
Overview of Seismic Data: E&P companies consider seismic data an important tool in finding and exploiting hydrocarbons. E&P companies use seismic data in oil and gas exploration and development efforts to increase the probability of drilling success, to better delineate existing oil and gas fields and to augment their reservoir completion and management techniques. Historically, seismic data was tied to exploration capital expenditures, which are significantly more volatile, as E&P companies used seismic data to increase the success rate of discovering hydrocarbon deposits. With the shift to unconventional plays, E&P companies use seismic data in those plays as a development tool to better identify efficient drilling plans and maximize production by identifying and understanding a series of critical characteristics of the targeted resource. The cost of seismic data represents a small portion of the total cost of drilling and completion for most projects, but provides substantial benefits to operators, including minimizing potential for uneconomic wells.
Drivers of Ongoing Demand for Seismic Data: There are many drivers that cause seismic data to be licensed repeatedly by different customers over a long time period, including fractured mineral positions, stratified mineral interests, partnerships, lease and option turnover, correlation to well analogs, commodity pricing, improvements in data processing techniques and developments in drilling and production technology. 
Merger and acquisition activity, including the formation of joint ventures, may also generate increased licensing revenues for seismic data providers. Licenses to seismic data are generally structured such that they do not transfer in the case of a change of control and do not include access to or use by partners. Both circumstances require additional payments for new licenses.
North American Oil and Gas Markets: The emergence of shale and other unconventional plays has led to significant increases in production of oil and natural gas in North America. Oil prices decreased significantly in 2015 and 2016 due to high production and high global inventories which resulted in reduced capital expenditures by E&P companies. OPEC and non-OPEC producers cut oil production in 2017 which led to rising and stabilizing oil prices in the second half of 2017. Due to the increase in crude oil prices, 2017 was the first year of North America E&P spending recovery with capital expenditures increasing an estimated 35% to 47%. The recovery is expected to continue in 2018; however, the pace of North America spending is expected to moderate with E&P capital expenditures forecast to increase 14% to 21% in 2018. Recent E&P surveys indicate that cash flow remains the leading determinant of budget decisions in 2018. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) expects crude oil prices to continue to show improvement. In its January 2018 report, the EIA predicts the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil to average $55.33 per barrel in 2018 and $57.43 per barrel in 2019 as compared to the average of $50.79 in 2017. In this same report, the EIA predicts natural gas spot prices to remain fairly constant with an average of $2.88 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2018 and $2.92 per MMBtu in 2019 as compared to the average of $2.99 per MMBtu in 2017. Higher oil prices provide more latitude for E&P companies to spend more and stay within cash flows.
Importance of Seismic Data: We believe the use of 3D seismic data will continue to be an important part of oil and gas companies’ exploration and development projects as they are continually looking to reduce drilling risk, decrease oil and natural gas finding costs and increase the efficiencies of reservoir location, delineation, completion and management. In addition, we believe that seismic data is a key component of oil and gas production activity in the unconventional plays. Seismic data can provide a wealth of insight into the targeted resource, including areal extent, depth, thickness, faulting patterns and a number of complex rock properties. Such insights enhance our customers’ ability to design efficient and productive horizontal drilling and fracking programs. Understanding these unique features is critical for our customers as they develop their horizontal drilling plans, which can result in lateral drilling that reaches over one mile in each direction.
Licenses and Marketing
We actively market data from our library to customers under non-exclusive license agreements using a well-developed marketing strategy combined with strong geophysical expertise. Our licenses are generally non-assignable and typically provide 
10

that in the event of a change of control of a customer-licensee, the surviving entity must pay a fee to maintain a license for any data it seeks to continue to use and for which such entity previously did not have a license. We employ an experienced sales force and it is our operating philosophy to actively market our seismic library. Our team of dedicated marketing specialists seeks to maximize license sale opportunities and create innovative methods of contracting opportunities by monitoring petroleum industry exploration and development activities through close interaction with E&P companies on a daily basis.
Licenses generally are granted for cash, payable within 30 days of invoice, although we occasionally permit a customer to make an initial payment upon inception of the license followed by periodic payments over time, usually not more than 12 months. Some licenses provide for additional payments to us if the licensee acquires additional mineral leases, drills wells or achieves oil or gas production in the areas covered by the licensed data.
Fundamental to our business model is the concept that once seismic data is created it is owned by us and added to our library for licensing to customers in the oil and gas industry on a non-exclusive basis. Since the data is a long-lived asset, such data can be licensed repeatedly and over an extended period of time to different customers at the same time.
Backlog
At February 12, 2018, we had gross capital expenditure commitments related to data creation projects of approximately $10.9 million. We anticipate that the majority of this backlog will be recognized over the next 12 months. This is compared to gross capital expenditure commitments at February 13, 2017 of $17.4 million.
Seitel Solutions
To support our seismic data licensing business and our clients, we maintain warehouse and electronic storage facilities at our Houston, Texas headquarters and our Calgary, Alberta locations. Through our Solutions business unit, we offer the ability to access and interact with the seismic data we own and market via a standard web browser and the Internet. Using proprietary technology, we store, manage, access and deliver data, tapes and graphic cross-sections to our licensees. In addition, Solutions offers use of its proprietary quality control software to the seismic brokerage community principally in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. We also offer data management services to select clients.
Customers
We market our seismic data to a varied customer base. Our customers include independent oil and gas companies, major integrated oil and gas companies and national oil companies, as well as small and mid-cap E&P companies and private prospect generating individuals. During the year ended December 31, 2017, two customers accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue, totaling approximately $10.2 million (11.3%) and $9.1 million (10.1%). One customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016, totaling approximately $15.4 million (16.3%). During the year ended December 31, 2015, two customers accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue, totaling approximately $14.5 million (14.5%) and $12.5 million (12.5%) . We believe that the quality of our data, the breadth of its coverage in the major active North American basins and our longstanding commitment to client service enables us to attract top-tier clients. Because we do not acquire data speculatively, strategic relationships with our customers have been and will continue to be critical to our growth. We do not believe that the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows or results of operations.
Competition
The creation and licensing of seismic data is competitive. Customers consider several factors, including location of data, price, technological expertise and reputation for quality and dependability, when choosing a service provider. There are a number of geophysical companies that create, market and license seismic data and maintain seismic data libraries. Rather than outsourcing their seismic data activities, some oil and gas companies create their own seismic data libraries, which they license to others. Our largest competitors, many of whom are engaged in acquiring seismic data, as well as maintaining a data library, are: CGG; Geokinetics, Inc.; Geophysical Pursuit, Inc.; FairfieldNodal; Pulse Seismic Inc.; Seismic Exchange, Inc.; TGS Nopec; Vector Seismic Data Processing, Inc., a subsidiary of Schlumberger Limited; and WesternGeco. Many of our competitors have substantially larger revenues and resources than we do.
Regulations
Our business involves the licensing of primarily onshore seismic data and other related products and services in North America to E&P companies and is impacted by federal, provincial, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States, Canada and Mexico governing us, our third-party contractors and/or our E&P customers and relating to worker health and safety and protection of the environment. These regulations impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations including

permitting of regulated activities and limiting or prohibiting performance of seismic activities in environmentally sensitive or protected areas. These laws and regulations are also subject to change over time as a result of political, economic or social climate. Moreover, existing environmental laws may be amended and new environmental laws may be adopted in the future that impose more stringent requirements on the operations of our customers. The imposition of such stringent requirements may increase those customers’ operating costs or delay or curtail their pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, any one or more of which developments could reduce demand for our seismic data and related services and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. 
Historically, our compliance costs with applicable environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flow and results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future as these laws and regulations are subject to amendment or reinterpretation. See the Risk Factor “We, our third-party contractors and/or our E&P customers are subject to a variety of environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, which may result in increased costs and significant liabilities” under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussions on hydraulic fracturing, ozone standards, climate change, and other regulations relating to environmental protection or worker safety.
Seasonality and Timing Factors
Our results of operations fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors. Our results are influenced by oil and gas industry capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns. These budgets are not necessarily spent in equal or progressive increments during the year, with spending patterns affected by individual oil and gas company requirements as well as industry-wide conditions. In addition, under our revenue recognition policy, revenue recognition from data licensing contracts is dependent upon, among other things, when the customer selects the data or when the data becomes available for delivery. As a result, our seismic data revenue does not necessarily flow evenly or progressively during a year or from year to year. Although the majority of our data licensing transactions provide for fees to us of under $750,000 per transaction, occasionally a single data license transaction from our library, including those resulting from the merger and acquisition or property sales activity of our oil and gas customers, may be substantially larger. Such large license transactions, the completion and delivery of data or an unusually large number of, or reduction in, data selections by customers can materially impact our results during a quarter, creating an impression of a revenue trend that may not be repeated in subsequent periods. In our data creation activities, weather-related or other events outside our control may impact or delay surveys during any given quarter.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we and our subsidiaries had 82 full-time employees, including four executive officers, 15 marketing staff and 28 technical staff. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Raw Material and Proprietary Information
We are not dependent on any particular raw materials, patents, trademarks or copyrights for our business operations. Our seismic data library is proprietary confidential information, which is not generally available to the public and is subject to confidentiality agreements with our employees and customers. We believe that our seismic data library is also protected by common law copyright.
