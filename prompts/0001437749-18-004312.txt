 Item 1.     Business.

Overview 
 
We are a bank holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, that has elected to become a “financial holding company” under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”). We engage in the business of banking through our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, National Bank of Commerce, which we may refer to as “the Bank” or “NBC.”
 
Through the Bank, we provide a broad array of financial services to businesses, business owners, and professionals. We operate seven full-service banking offices in Alabama, located in Birmingham, Huntsville, Auburn-Opelika, and Baldwin County, twenty‐one full‐service banking offices in central and northeast Florida (including under the trade names United Legacy Bank, Reunion Bank of Florida, Patriot Bank and FirstAtlantic Bank) and two full‐service banking offices in the Atlanta, Georgia metro area (including under the trade names Private Bank of Buckhead, Private Bank of Decatur and PrivatePlus Mortgage).
 
We engage in the business of factoring commercial receivables through the Bank’s ownership of a 70% equity interest in CBI Holding Company, LLC (“CBI”). CBI owns Corporate Billing, LLC (“Corporate Billing”), a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama, that provides factoring, invoicing, collection, and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers throughout the United States and parts of Canada.
 
In January 2017, we completed our previously announced acquisition of Private Bancshares, Inc. (“Private Bancshares”), as result of which we acquired our two full-service banking offices in Georgia. In June 2017, we closed an underwritten public offering of 1,104,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $37.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $38.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. In August 2017, we acquired Patriot Bank, a Florida banking corporation headquartered in Trinity, Florida. As a result of the Patriot Bank transaction, we acquired four full-service banking offices in the Tampa, Florida metro area. Also in August 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire FirstAtlantic Financial Holdings, Inc. (“FirstAtlantic”), the holding company of FirstAtlantic Bank, headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida. As a result of the FirstAtlantic transaction, which became effective on January 1, 2018, we acquired eight full-service banking offices in the Jacksonville, Florida metro area.
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had total assets of approximately $2.74 billion, total net loans of approximately $2.12 billion, total deposits of approximately $2.29 billion, and total shareholders’ equity of approximately $400 million.
 
Our Products and Services 
 
Through the Bank, we engage in the business of banking, which consists primarily of accepting deposits from the public and making loans and other investments. Through Corporate Billing, we provide factoring, invoicing, collection, and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers throughout the United States and parts of Canada. Our principal sources of funds for loans and investments at the Bank are demand, time, savings, and other deposits (including negotiable orders of withdrawal, or NOW accounts) and the amortization and prepayments of loans and investments. Our principal sources of income are interest and fees collected on loans, interest collected on other investments, fees earned from the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans, and service charges, as well as income from factored receivables through Corporate Billing. Our principal expenses are interest paid on savings and other deposits (including NOW accounts), interest paid on other borrowings, employee compensation, office expenses, and other overhead expenses.

Deposits 
 
Our principal sources of funds are core deposits, including demand deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts, savings deposits and certificates of deposit. Transaction accounts include checking and NOW accounts, which customers use for cash management and which provide a source of fee income for us, as well as a low-cost source of funds. Time and savings accounts also provide a relatively stable and low-cost source of funding. Our largest source of funds is money market accounts. Certificates of deposit in excess of $100,000 are held primarily by customers in our market areas. We utilize brokered and internet certificates of deposit to supplement our market funding sources when funding needs or pricing warrant the use of wholesale funding.

Deposit rates are reviewed weekly by senior management. Management believes that the rates that we offer are competitive with those offered by other institutions in our market areas. We also focus on customer service to attract and retain deposits.

Lending 
 
We offer a range of lending services, including real estate, consumer and commercial loans, to individuals, small businesses, and other organizations located in or conducting a substantial portion of their business in our market areas. Our total loans, net of unearned income, at December 31, 2017, were approximately $2.14 billion, or approximately 85.9% of total earning assets. The interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk, maturity and amount of the loan and are further subject to competitive pressures, money market rates, availability of funds, and government regulations.

Real Estate Loans. Loans secured by real estate are the primary component of our loan portfolio, constituting approximately $1.71 billion, or 79.8% of total loans, net of unearned income, at December 31, 2017. We originate consumer and commercial loans for the purpose of acquiring real estate that are secured by such real estate. We also often take real estate as an additional source of collateral to secure commercial and industrial loans. Such loans are classified as real estate loans rather than commercial and industrial loans if the real estate collateral is considered significant as a secondary source of repayment for the loan. Loans are typically made on a recourse basis and are supported by financial statements and a review of the repayment ability of the borrower(s) and/or guarantor(s). Origination fees are charged for many loans secured by real estate.
 
Our real estate lending activities are generally characterized by the following types of loans and loan terms.
 

● | Commercial real estate term loans accrue at either variable or fixed rates. The variable rates approximate current market rates. Amortizations are typically no more than 25 years.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The primary type of residential mortgage loan is the single-family first mortgage, typically structured with fixed or adjustable interest rates, based on market conditions. These loans usually have fixed rates for up to five years, with maturities of 15 to 30 years. We also originate home equity lines of credit secured by residential property. These loans are typically made on a variable-rate basis with maturities up to 10 years.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Construction and land development loans are typically made on a variable-rate basis. Loan terms usually do not exceed 24 months.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We originate residential loans for sale into the secondary market. These loans are made in accordance with underwriting standards set by the purchaser of the loan, normally as to loan-to-value ratio, interest rate, borrower qualification, and documentation. These loans are originated on both a “best efforts” and a “mandatory delivery” basis. We typically collect from the borrower or purchaser a combination of the origination fee, discount points, and/or a service release fee.

Commercial and Industrial Loans. We make loans for commercial purposes in various lines of business. These loans are typically made on terms up to five years at fixed or variable rates. The loans are secured by various types of collateral, including accounts receivable, inventory, or, in the case of equipment loans, the financed equipment. We attempt to reduce our credit risk on commercial loans by underwriting the loan based on the borrower’s cash flow and ability to service the debt from earnings, and by limiting the loan-to-value ratio. Historically, we have typically loaned up to 80% on loans secured by accounts receivable, up to 50% on loans secured by inventory (which are usually also secured by accounts receivable), and up to 100% on loans secured by equipment. We also make some unsecured commercial loans. Commercial and industrial loans constituted $258.6 million, or 12.1% of our loan portfolio, at December 31, 2017. Interest rates are negotiable and are based on the borrower’s financial condition, credit history, management stability and collateral.
 
Consumer Loans. Consumer lending includes installment lending to individuals in our market areas and generally consists of loans to purchase automobiles and other consumer durable goods. Consumer loans constituted $26.3 million, or 1.2% of our loan portfolio, at December 31, 2017. Consumer loans are underwritten based on the borrower’s income, current debt level, past credit history and collateral. Consumer rates are both variable and fixed, with terms negotiable. Terms generally range from one to five years, depending on the nature and condition of the collateral. Periodic amortization, generally monthly, is typically required.
 
Loan Approval. Certain credit risks are inherent in making loans. These include repayment risks, risks resulting from uncertainties in the future value of collateral, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers. In particular, longer maturities increase the risk that economic conditions will change and adversely affect collectibility.
 
We attempt to minimize loan losses through various means and the use of standardized underwriting criteria. We have established a standardized loan policy that may be modified based on local market conditions. In particular, on larger credits, we generally rely on the cash flow of a debtor as the source of repayment and secondarily on the value of the underlying collateral. In addition, we attempt to utilize shorter loan terms in order to reduce the risk of a decline in the value of such collateral.
 
We address repayment risks by adhering to internal credit policies and procedures. These policies and procedures include officer and customer lending limits, a loan committee approval process for larger loans, documentation examination, and follow-up procedures for loan review and any exceptions to credit policies. The point in the loan approval process at which a loan is approved depends on the size of the borrower’s credit relationship with the bank and the loan authority of the lending officer to whom the loan request is made. Each of our lending officers has the authority to approve loans up to an approved loan authority amount, as determined by the Bank’s board of directors. Loans in excess of the highest loan authority amount of a particular lending officer must be approved by either the Bank’s loan committee or another officer with sufficient loan authority to approve the request.
 
Risk Ratings. Loan officers are directly responsible for monitoring the risk in their respective portfolios. On commercial loans, risk grades are assigned by the loan officer for the probability of default following an analysis of borrower characteristics and external economic factors. However, on consumer loans, risk grades are primarily determined by a borrower’s credit score, personal debt ratio, repayment history, and liquidity.
 
Electronic Banking 
 
We offer electronic banking services to our customers, including commercial and retail online banking, automated bill payment, mobile banking, and remote deposit capture for certain customers.
 
Factoring 
 
Since August 29, 2014, NBC has owned a 70% interest in CBI, the holding company of Corporate Billing. Corporate Billing is a transaction-based finance company engaged in the purchase of accounts receivable at a discount from businesses throughout the United States and parts of Canada, a business traditionally known as “factoring.” In a typical factoring transaction, Corporate Billing purchases all of the rights associated with the account receivable and assumes the billing and collection responsibilities. Corporate Billing may purchase a receivable with or without recourse. If an account is purchased without recourse, Corporate Billing bears the loss if the account debtor does not pay the invoice amount. If the receivable is purchased with recourse, however, Corporate Billing has the right to collect the unpaid invoice amount from the seller of the receivable if the account debtor does not pay. Corporate Billing engages in both recourse and non-recourse purchases, with its recourse operations focused primarily in the transportation industry, and its non-recourse operations focused primarily in the automotive dealer and distributor industries. As an operating subsidiary of NBC, Corporate Billing is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”).

Market Areas

We conduct our banking operations through the Bank’s seven full-service banking offices in Alabama (in Birmingham, Huntsville, Auburn-Opelika, and Baldwin County), twenty-two full-service banking offices in central and northeast Florida (including in the Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville, Florida metro areas) and two full-service banking offices and a loan production office in the Atlanta, Georgia metro area. In addition to the “National Bank of Commerce” name, we also use the trade names “United Legacy Bank,” “Reunion Bank of Florida,” “Patriot Bank” and “FirstAtlantic Bank” for certain of our Florida offices and “Private Bank of Buckhead,” “Private Bank of Decatur” and “Private Plus Mortgage” for our operations in Georgia. We conduct our factoring business through Corporate Billing’s office in Decatur, Alabama, with clients located throughout the United States and parts of Canada. Technology allows us to service a national client base in our factoring business, with sales representatives traveling to meet existing and potential clients in their places of business. 
Competition 
 
The financial services industry is highly competitive. We compete for loans, deposits and financial services in all of our principal markets. We compete directly with other bank and non-bank institutions located within our markets, internet-based banks, out-of-market banks, and bank holding companies that advertise in or otherwise serve our markets, along with money market and mutual funds, brokerage houses, mortgage companies, and insurance companies or other commercial entities that offer financial products and services. Competition involves efforts to retain current customers, obtain new loans and deposits, increase the scope and type of services that we provide, and offer competitive interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans. Many of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages, including greater financial resources, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer additional services, more favorable pricing alternatives, and lower origination and operating costs. Some of our competitors have been in business for a long time and have an established customer base and name recognition. We believe that our competitive pricing, personalized service, and community involvement enable us to effectively compete in the communities in which we operate.
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 433 full-time and full-time equivalent employees. None of these employees is party to a collective bargaining agreement.
 
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
 
General 
 
We are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. These laws restrict permissible activities and investments and require compliance with various consumer protection provisions applicable to lending, deposit, brokerage, and fiduciary activities. They also impose capital adequacy requirements and conditions on a bank holding company’s ability to repurchase stock or to receive dividends from its subsidiary banks. NCC and its non-bank subsidiary, National Commerce Risk Management, Inc., are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), and NBC and its operating subsidiary, CBI, are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the OCC. These regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on our operations. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct and profitability of our activities.
 
To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of such provisions. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal levels. The likelihood and timing of any changes in these laws and regulations, and the impact that such changes may have on us, are difficult to ascertain. A change in applicable laws or regulations, or in the manner in which such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material effect on our business, operations, and earnings.

Regulation of NCC 
 
NCC is a registered bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company under the BHCA and is subject to the examination authority and the regulatory and periodic reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve. Under the BHCA, bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries generally may engage in activities that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto, and may, in some cases and subject to certain restrictions, invest in companies not engaged in activities closely related to banking. As a financial holding company, we are permitted to (i) engage in other activities that the Federal Reserve determines to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally, and (ii) acquire an equity stake in companies engaged in such activities. We may not, however, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank holding company or a bank without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. In order to maintain our status as a financial holding company, NBC must remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” under applicable regulations and maintain at least a “satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. Failure to meet one or more of the requirements would mean, depending on the requirements not met, that we could not undertake new activities, make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies, or continue certain activities.
 
Subject to various exceptions, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require approval from the Federal Reserve before any person or company may acquire “control” of a bank holding company. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company. A rebuttable presumption arises if a person or company acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities and either: (i) the bank holding company has a registered class of securities under Section 12 of the Securities Act or (ii) no other person owns a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction.
 
There are a number of restrictions imposed on NCC by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to depositors and to the Deposit Insurance Fund maintained by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) in the event that a subsidiary depository institution should become insolvent. For example, federal law requires a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances in which it might not otherwise do so. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a non-bank subsidiary upon the Federal Reserve’s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.
 
Any capital loan by a bank holding company to a subsidiary depository institution is subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the institution. In addition, in the event of the holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment made by the bank holding company to a federal banking regulatory agency to maintain the capital of its subsidiary depository institution(s) will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution (including the claims of the FDIC as a subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the institution’s holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit that they have made to such insured depository institution.

Regulation of NBC

NBC’s operations and investments are subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the National Bank Act, the regulations of the OCC and other federal banking statutes and regulations, including with respect to the level of reserves that NBC must maintain against deposits, restrictions on the types, amount, and terms and conditions of loans that it may originate and limits on the types of other activities in which it may engage and the investments that it may make. The OCC also has the power to prevent unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. Because NBC’s deposits are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent provided by law, it is also subject to certain FDIC regulations, and the FDIC has backup examination authority and some enforcement powers over NBC. NBC is also subject to numerous state and federal statutes and regulations that affect its business, activities and operations.
Transactions with Affiliates 
 
We are subject to federal laws, such as Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, that limit the size and number of the transactions that depository institutions may engage in with their affiliates. Under these provisions, transactions (such as loans or investments) by a bank with non-bank affiliates are generally limited to 10% of the bank’s capital and surplus for all covered transactions with any one affiliate and 20% of capital and surplus for all covered transactions with all affiliates. Any extensions of credit to affiliates, with limited exceptions, must be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. Banks are also prohibited from purchasing any “low quality” assets from an affiliate. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) imposed additional requirements on transactions with affiliates, by, among other things, expanding the definition of “covered transactions” and increasing the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.
 
We are also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to our executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their related interests under Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, as implemented by Regulation O of the Federal Reserve. These extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including with respect to interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties, and they must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Furthermore, we are prohibited from engaging in asset purchase or sale transactions with our officers, directors or principal stockholders unless the transaction is on market terms and, if the transaction represents more than 10% of the capital and surplus of the Bank, a majority of the Bank’s disinterested directors has approved the transaction.
 
Monetary Policy 
 
Our earnings are and will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have a significant effect on the operating results, lending practices, investments and deposits of commercial banks through its open market operations in United States government securities and through its regulation of, among other things, the discount rate on bank borrowings and the reserve requirements against bank deposits. It is not possible to predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.
Deposit Insurance 
 
The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund maintained by the FDIC. As a result, the Bank is required to pay periodic assessments to maintain insurance coverage for its deposits. Under the FDIC’s assessment system for banks with less than $10 billion in assets, the assessment rate is determined based on a number of factors, including the Bank’s CAMELS (supervisory) rating, leverage ratio, net income, non-performing loan ratios, OREO ratios, core deposit ratios, one-year organic asset growth and a loan mix index. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance assessments would likely have an adverse effect on our operating expense, results of operations, and cash flows. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. Furthermore, deposit insurance may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.

Dividend Restrictions 
 
NCC is a legal entity separate and distinct from NBC. NCC’s ability to pay dividends and make other distributions depends in part on the receipt of dividends from NBC and is limited by federal and state law. The specific limits depend on a number of factors, including NBC’s recent earnings, recent dividends, level of capital and regulatory status. The regulators are authorized, and under certain circumstances are required, to determine that the payment of dividends or other distributions by a bank would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit that payment. For example, federal law generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized.
 
A national bank generally may not withdraw, either in the form of a dividend or otherwise, any portion of its permanent capital and may not declare a dividend in excess of its retained net profits. Further, dividends that may be paid by a national bank without the express approval of the OCC are limited to an amount equal to the bank’s retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years plus retained net profits up to the date of any dividend declaration in the current calendar year. Retained net profits, as defined by the OCC, consist of net income, less dividends declared during the period. Dividend payments by NBC in the future will require the generation of net income and could require regulatory approval if any proposed dividends are in excess of prescribed guidelines.
 
The ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends and make distributions can also be limited by other laws or regulations. The Federal Reserve, which has authority to prohibit a bank holding company from paying dividends or making other distributions, has issued a Supervisory Letter stating that a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends unless, among other things, (i) its net income available to common stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends paid during that period, is sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition and (iii) the dividend will not cause the company to fail to meet, or be in danger of failing to meet, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Accordingly, a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or that can only be funded in ways that weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. Federal regulations relating to capital adequacy create additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends.
 
Capital Adequacy 
 
In July 2013, the federal banking regulatory agencies adopted regulations to implement the framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision for strengthening international capital and liquidity, known as “Basel III” (the “Basel III Rule”). The Basel III Rule provides risk-based capital guidelines designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks, to account for off-balance sheet exposures, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Under these guidelines, assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate risk-weights. The net amount of assets remaining after applying the risk-weights to the gross asset values comprises the institution’s total risk-weighted assets. An institution’s total risk-weighted assets are used to calculate its regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Rule establishes minimum capital and leverage ratios that supervised financial institutions are required to maintain, while also providing countercyclical capital requirements so that the required amount of capital increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction, consistent with safety and soundness. Under the Basel III Rule, banks must maintain a specified capital conservation buffer above each of the required minimum capital levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying certain discretionary bonuses.
 
As an additional means of identifying problems in the financial management of depository institutions, the federal banking regulatory agencies have established certain non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator. The standards relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure and executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards.

Prompt Corrective Action 
 
In addition to the required minimum capital levels described above, federal law establishes a system of “prompt corrective actions” that federal banking agencies are required to take, and certain actions that they have discretion to take, based on the capital category into which a federally regulated depository institution falls. Regulations set forth detailed procedures and criteria for implementing prompt corrective action in the case of any institution that is not adequately capitalized. Each institution is assigned to one of five categories based on its capital ratios: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Institutions categorized as “undercapitalized” or worse become subject to increasing levels of regulatory oversight and restrictions, which may include, among other things, limitations on growth and activities and payment of dividends. 
Community Reinvestment Act 
 
The Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”) requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to assess all financial institutions that they regulate to determine whether these institutions are meeting the credit needs of the communities that they serve, including their assessment area(s) (as established for these purposes in accordance with applicable regulations based principally on the location of the institution’s branch offices). Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve” or “unsatisfactory.” An institution’s record in meeting the requirements of the CRA is made publicly available and is taken into consideration in connection with any applications it files with federal regulators to engage in certain activities, including approval of a branch or other deposit facility, mergers and acquisitions, office relocations or expansions into non-banking activities. NBC received a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent CRA evaluation.
Anti-Money Laundering Laws

Under various federal laws, including the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act (also known as the “Bank Secrecy Act of 1970”), as amended by the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence and “know your customer” requirements, in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. These laws also mandate that financial institutions establish anti-money laundering programs meeting certain standards and require the federal banking regulators to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing applications for bank merger and acquisition activities. 
Privacy of Customer Information 
 
The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (also known as the “Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act” or “GLBA”) and the implementing regulations issued by federal banking regulatory agencies require financial institutions (including banks, insurance agencies and broker/dealers) to adopt policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about their customers to non-affiliated third parties. In general, financial institutions are required to explain to customers their policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information, and, unless otherwise required or permitted by law, financial institutions are prohibited from disclosing such information except as provided in their policies and procedures. Specifically, the GLBA established certain information security guidelines that require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.

Regulation of Lending Practices
 
Our lending practices are subject to a number of federal and state laws, as supplemented by the rules and regulations of the various agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these laws. These include, among others, the following:

● | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the communities that it serves;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed, or other specified factors in extending credit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies, certain identity theft protections, and certain credit and other disclosures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring certain disclosures concerning loan closing costs and escrows, and governing transfers of loan servicing and the amounts of escrows in connection with loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Military Lending Act, governing the extension of consumer credit to members of the United States armed forces on active duty and their dependents;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which restricts or limits civil actions with respect to certain financial transactions against military servicemembers who are called to active duty; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | rules and regulations established by the National Flood Insurance Program.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), an independent bureau with broad authority to regulate the consumer finance industry, including regulated financial institutions, non-banks and others involved in extending credit to consumers. The CFPB has authority through rulemaking, orders, policy statements, guidance and enforcement actions to administer and enforce federal consumer financial laws. Although the CFPB has the power to interpret, administer and enforce federal consumer financial laws, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the federal banking regulatory agencies continue to have examination and enforcement powers over the financial institutions that they supervise relating to the matters within the jurisdiction of the CFPB if the supervised institutions have less than $10 billion in assets. The CFPB has adopted a number of rules that impact our lending practices, including, among other things, (i) requiring financial institutions to make a “reasonable and good faith determination” that a consumer has a “reasonable ability” to repay a residential mortgage loan before making such a loan, (ii) requiring sponsors of asset-backed securities to retain at least 5% of the credit risk of the assets underlying the securities (and generally prohibiting sponsors from transferring or hedging that credit risk), and (iii) imposing a number of new and enhanced requirements on the mortgage servicing industry, including rules regarding communications with borrowers, maintenance of customer account records, procedures for responding to written borrower requests and complaints of errors, servicing delinquent loans, and conducting foreclosure proceedings, among other measures.

Regulation of Deposit Operations

Federal Home Loan Bank Membership 
 
NBC is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the “FHLB”). Each member of the FHLB is required to maintain a minimum investment in the Class B stock of the FHLB. The Board of Directors of the FHLB can increase the minimum investment requirements if it concludes that additional capital is required to allow the FHLB to meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Because the extent of any obligation on the part of NBC to increase the level of its investment in the FHLB depends entirely on the occurrence of a future event, we are currently unable to determine the extent of future required potential payments to the FHLB. Additionally, in the event that a member financial institution fails, the right of the FHLB to seek repayment of funds loaned to that institution will take priority over the rights of all other creditors. 
Future Legislation and Regulation 
 
We are heavily regulated by regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels.  Since the 2008 financial crisis, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry, leading in many cases to greater uncertainty and compliance costs for regulated entities. For example, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have required us to make material expenditures, particularly in the form of personnel training costs and additional compliance expenses. Recently, however, we have seen an effort at the federal level to provide some relief from the regulatory burdens placed on banks as a result of Dodd-Frank Act.  A number of bills have been introduced in early 2018 in both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate that would scale back the regulatory burdens placed on banks in recent years.  It is impossible to know at this time what practical impact these bills will have on our business, if enacted.  In addition to the legislative changes, there have been leadership changes at all of the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, the OCC, the CFPB, and the Federal Reserve.  These legislative proposals and the changes in the key regulators who implement the banking laws are likely to impact our business; however, we cannot predict the actual effect that these proposals would have on our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
