Item 1.
Business

Our business plan is to pursue a business combination through the acquisition of, or merger with, an existing company seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly traded corporation. We are not restricting our potential target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company.

On June 26, 2017, our former controlling shareholder, Coqui Radio Pharmaceuticals, Corp. (Coqui), sold 9,947,490 shares of common stock to Irwin Eskanos in a private transaction. Concurrently with this sale of controlling interest, our board of directors appointed Mr. Eskanos as our new sole Director, President, Secretary, Treasurer, CEO, and CFO, and accepted the resignation of Carmen I. Bigles, our former sole officer and director. Also, concurrently with the sale of controlling interest, Coqui agreed pay in full, and indemnify us for, our outstanding liabilities as of the date of the sale.

Our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to generate new financing or sufficient cash flows to continue our reporting obligations to the Securities and Exchange Commission on a timely basis. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve a business combination through the acquisition of, or merger with, an existing company. We currently do not have any firm arrangements for financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when required, in the amounts necessary to execute on our plans in full, or on terms which are economically feasible.
