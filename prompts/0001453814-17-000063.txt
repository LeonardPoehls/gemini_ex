Item 1. Business
Company Overview
Medidata is a global provider of a platform of cloud-based solutions for life sciences, enabling efficiency and quality throughout clinical development programs, aimed at accelerating processes, enhancing decision-making, minimizing operational risk, saving resources, and enabling transformational trial strategies.
Our customers are pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device companies, academic institutions, contract research organizations ("CROs"), and other organizations engaged in clinical testing. Our global customer base includes 17 of the top 25 global pharmaceutical companies measured by research and development expense, as well as numerous middle-market life science companies. In 2016, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues.
Medidata's platform of advanced technology solutions and data analytics is aimed at enabling efficient and safe development, using secure cloud and hybrid cloud infrastructure to connect and support users over the Internet.
Customers can utilize our entire cloud-based platform or purchase individual solutions or products. We offer our technology on an enterprise or multi-study basis. Customers can also use our solutions on a single-study basis for a limited number of trials or to evaluate them prior to committing to a multi-study arrangement.
Subscription and professional services represent approximately 85% and 15% of our business, respectively. Our business model provides us with a recurring revenue stream that we believe delivers greater revenue visibility than perpetual software licensing models.
Medidata's Approach
Medidata's solutions are designed to address the underlying requirements of clinical development, not only bringing efficiencies to existing processes, but also transforming the enterprise with enhanced productivity and quality. Our platform focuses on increasing efficiency, reducing redundancies and data entry errors, maximizing visibility, and consolidating workflows. We build our solutions to be interoperable with third-party software and data feeds, creating a collaborative ecosystem that broadens the development technology enterprise. This increases the value of legacy, installed systems and new technology such as mobile device applications, and simplifies migration from competitive systems.
We believe our solutions provide our customers with the following benefits:

• | faster trial results;


• | scalability;


• | improved data quality and minimization of risk;


• | enhanced investigator experience;


• | interoperability to support ecosystem; and


• | global connectivity across sponsor and investigator sites.

Our Strategy
Our strategy is to enable our customers to bring their new and enhanced medical treatments to the public quickly, efficiently, and safely by providing a platform that uses innovative technology to automate, streamline, support, and enhance clinical development activities. Key elements of our strategy include:
1


• | Broaden our footprint with our existing customers. We refer to this footprint, measured by the number of Medidata products used by our customer base, as "density." Our strategy of developing technology solutions across the clinical trial process provides additional avenues for growing our business. We will continue to demonstrate the significant efficiencies that our existing customer base can achieve by standardizing end-to-end clinical development processes on our platform and by expanding the use of our solutions. We also intend to drive increased usage by facilitating our customers' use in new trials and converting existing single-study customers into multi-study customers.


• | Expand usage of existing products. We refer to the level of usage of Medidata products that are already deployed by customers as "intensity." In cases where customers utilize our solutions for only a subset of their clinical trial activities, we seek to drive usage across more trials, therapeutic areas, geographies, and phases.


• | Launch regular platform enhancements. We will continue to enhance our unified, integrated platform with regular releases, adding new functionality, integrations, and user benefits to our solutions.


• | Build additional innovative solutions, including new analytics and benchmarks, into our platform. We will continue to build new innovative solutions that further transform the clinical development process, and offer them to new and existing customers. We will continue to develop our analytics and benchmarking capabilities, creating value for our customers by enhancing decision-making.


• | Expand our global customer base. We are expanding our sales, marketing, and services resources in areas around the globe with significant trial activity. We expect clinical technology adoption to continue to increase, resulting in significant growth in spending on technology solutions. Our view is that clinical development is underinvested in technology, and new technologies will expand opportunities by replacing manual and under-automated activities.


• | Increase indirect sales partnership initiatives. We will continue to pursue strategic partnerships with CROs and systems integrators to position our software and analytics solutions as the platform of choice for their outsourced clinical trial management services. Our well-established program of support, training, and certification enables partners to cost-effectively implement our solutions and services in sponsor studies as they provide their other services related to pharmaceutical development.


• | Position the Medidata Clinical Cloud as part of the evolving clinical ecosystem. We are building relationships, supporting technology partnerships and working with other innovative technology and data firms to position Medidata as a key player in the evolving clinical ecosystem. Our partnerships provide immediate benefits to our customers by enabling integrated systems and collaborative governance and future benefits by ensuring that our solutions are embedded in the next generation of innovations.


• | Communicate the enterprise-level value we create for our customers. Medidata's technology, metrics, and services are designed to drive value creation for our customers by reducing the overall cost of their clinical research and development efforts. We have invested in tools and workforce that measure, document, and communicate that value, and have integrated these resources into our market approach and solution development strategy.

Our Cloud-Based Technology
The Medidata Clinical Cloud
The Medidata Clinical Cloud provides a platform of technology and data analytics solutions designed to optimize activities across clinical development. A software-as-a-service ("SaaS") platform, the Medidata Clinical Cloud is fully scalable and expandable, offering the following capabilities:
Plan Study addresses three key areas to ensure optimal study design, grant development and negotiation, and investigator payments. Study Design Optimization enables customers to gain visibility into the impact of protocol elements on resource and trial endpoints. Grants Manager compares specific industry benchmarks and analytics, using the industry's largest database of negotiated procedure costs, to support appropriate grants to investigator sites and automated negotiations with multiple investigator sites. Payments enables customers to establish a global investigator payment strategy and process to easily automate payment calculation, distribution, and reporting, including tax and currency exchange calculations. These solutions help customers make the most efficient use of resources through better planning at the start of trial design and protocol development.
Support Sites provides robust risk management, reduced source document verification ("SDV"), real-time monitoring, and on-time, accurate payments. Even the most experienced clinical trial sites can encounter difficulties recruiting patients, ensuring data quality, and getting paid; such setbacks at a small subset of sites can adversely affect an entire study's quality, cost, and timeliness. Medidata supports site success with advanced capabilities in the form of Risk Based Monitoring, On-site Monitoring, Site Quality Management, and Targeted SDV. 
Engage Patients captures the voice of the patient in clinical studies using a comprehensive mobile health ("mHealth") solution, Medidata Patient Cloud. Medidata Patient Cloud enables sponsors to collect a richer, more complete dataset directly from the patient, accelerating patient-centric clinical research and improving the patient's clinical trial experience. Data is captured from wearable 
2

sensors and mobile apps using three secure, regulatory-compliant technologies— SensorLink, AppConnect, and ePRO— along with services that support and enrich the life cycle of an mHealth trial.
Conduct Study includes solutions for data capture and study management throughout the clinical trial research process. 
Data capture is centered around the industry-leading, fully integrated, robust and scalable electronic data capture ("EDC") and management system solution, Medidata RaveX. It provides a globally-accessible and intuitive user interface to facilitate the capture and cleaning of data from investigative sites, is designed for compliance with regulatory requirements, and supports electronic signatures. As part of Medidata's platform, it seamlessly links to tools for randomization, clinical supply tracking, safety system export, and site management, including monitoring and payments, reducing activity, time, and risk throughout a trial. Our strong support for industry standards, such as those provided by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium ("CDISC"), provides a foundation for integration with other systems at sponsors, CROs, and technology partners. RaveX can process and manage data from multiple sources, such as Medical Imaging, through its unified integrations, standards-based application programming interfaces ("APIs:), and other data feeds, providing one source of usable, comprehensive patient data throughout the trial. 
For study management, the Conduct Study suite offers capabilities that enable clinical teams to manage, monitor, control, integrate, and report operational and clinical data from patients and sites. These tools provide the foundation for an efficient and quality-driven trial, unified with data capture and patient capture activities, minimizing redundancies, enhancing decision-making, increasing speed, and reducing operational risk. Specific functions include randomization and trial supply management ("RTSM") via Balance, centralized medical coding via Coder, and safety data monitoring via Rave Safety Gateway.
Optimize Outcomes is designed to surface a broad range of embedded operational data across the clinical process, alongside the largest databases of industry-wide analyzable, anonymized information. The Medidata platform provides dashboards, interactive platforms, ad hoc and scheduled reporting, and interactive analytics to enhance customers' contextual decision-making and real-time operational adjustments. Products include Insights, Operational Performance Analytics ("OPAL") Diagnostics, Trial Assurance, and Centralized Statistical Analysis ("CSA").
Technology and Support
We have designed our technology to maximize ease of use, flexibility, data visibility, and system scalability to handle high-volume, global trials as well as smaller studies. We deploy our solutions through the use of industry-standard web browsers and mobile devices, service-oriented architectures ("SOA"), three-tiered server architectures, or a web server, a proprietary application server and a database server. End users can access our solutions through any web browser from anywhere in the world without downloading or installing any Medidata-specific software. In addition, our cloud-based solutions feature end-to-end support for Unicode characters, required to deliver multi-lingual studies. We utilize technologies such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and encryption to ensure the privacy and security of our customers' data, with a dedicated Security Information and Event Management ("SIEM") team monitoring our applications 24/7.
We develop our solutions on a broad base of technologies, including Java 2 Enterprise Edition ("J2EE"), Oracle, Microsoft.NET, Microsoft SQL Server, Business Objects, Ruby, AWS, Cassandra, MySQL, and Chef. By creating consistent data models that can accommodate the broad cloud-based requirements of multiple biopharmaceutical, medical device, and CRO customers, we have been able to avoid customer-specific builds or other customizations to our core product, thereby streamlining development and maintenance. Furthermore, our interfaces are built on fully documented APIs, which allow us to safely update customers' data in new versions of the system, and to develop additional interfaces to address new market opportunities. By including version control and the ability to dynamically integrate data without system interruption, we are better able to accommodate the industry-specific challenges facing clinical trial teams around protocol amendments and the need for incremental changes to study data collection and cleaning processes during a clinical trial.
Medidata provides world-class delivery services to customers utilizing our products, with state-of-the-art virtualization technologies to optimize the delivery of our cloud-based solutions, manage storage effectively, and maintain quality of service. These virtualization capabilities provide the ability to quickly scale to increased customer usage. Medidata manages a hybrid cloud, operating our solutions on a combination of private data center and public cloud. Advanced monitoring services are provided on a 24/7 basis by trained Medidata staff to ensure that usage is delivered in a consistent manner. Advanced backup and storage frameworks are in place, and regionally-diverse data centers and trained engineering teams are utilized to provide for quick reaction time in the event of a disaster.
We have a dedicated global organization to support our customers and applications worldwide. We offer 24/7 support to our customers' investigator sites through multi-lingual help desks located in Iselin, New Jersey; Conshohocken, Pennsylvania; Sofia, Bulgaria; London, United Kingdom; Tokyo, Japan; and Dalian, China.

Research and Development
We believe that our future success depends on our ability to continue to enhance and broaden our cloud-based solutions to meet the evolving needs of clinical trial sponsors and other entities engaged in clinical trials. Equally important is our ability to innovate, taking advantage of latest technologies and monitoring trends in healthcare. As of December 31, 2016, we had 480 employees in research and development. Our efforts are focused on developing new, complementary software solutions, as well as enhancing our existing solutions. Our research and development department includes a product management team that works with both internal and customer experts to create new features and functionality, a team of software project managers, and a technical documentation team, as well as product engineering and software quality assurance functions. We also have a dedicated team building integration software and APIs on top of our platform. While the bulk of research and development focuses on commercial products, we pride ourselves in maintaining a team devoted to research, and we encourage all developers to take part in our Innovation Time program, supporting and rewarding creativity.
When developing our technical solutions to manage clinical data, industry regulatory requirements also dictate that substantial documentation be created to demonstrate data integrity in the solutions, and that our systems perform repeatedly, reliably, and in accordance with the system requirements. This process is known in the industry as validation, and our deliverable is a software validation package. Our software development lifecycle practices, which are part of a required quality system, include streamlined methodologies for generating and maintaining validation packages during the software release process. For those products that allow customers to upgrade at their discretion, these methodologies include a validated path for upgrading existing installations and data. The robustness of the validation process and associated validation deliverables enable our customers to upgrade with confidence and stay on current technology. This allows Medidata to minimize the number of legacy releases that require maintenance and support. The majority of our cloud components are upgraded automatically, meaning that Medidata only has a single version of the software to maintain, and customers always access the latest, improved product. For products which are upgraded automatically, customers receive access to a fully tested software product prior to its official release into production as a fully validated product.
We incurred $112.6 million, $92.3 million, and $71.8 million in research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Research and development expenses comprised 24.3%, 23.5%, and 21.4% of revenue in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
Sales and Marketing 
We market and sell our cloud-based solutions through a direct sales force and through relationships with CROs and other strategic partners. Our marketing efforts focus on increasing awareness, consideration, and preference for our cloud-based solutions and professional services and generating qualified sales leads. As of December 31, 2016, we had 309 employees in sales and marketing.
4

Our sales force operates globally with a focus on North America, Europe, and Asia. The team is organized by both region and focus area and includes business consultants and sales operations support. Sales through this direct channel currently represent the largest source of our total revenues.
Many sponsors of clinical trials outsource some or all of their clinical research activities as a means of expanding capacity, controlling costs, and focusing on core strengths. Our CRO relationships help position our solutions as the core platform for their outsourced services. Through our Medidata Partner Program, we partner with CROs to deliver our clinical trial technology along with the CRO's monitoring, project management, data management, and other expertise. We train, certify, and support our CRO and other clinical services partners on our solutions, which enables our partners to quickly and cost-effectively implement our technology in sponsors' studies.
As part of our customer and prospect approach, we measure and communicate the value of adopting our cloud-based solutions and platform in lowering costs, reducing time to market, minimizing risk, and enhancing therapeutic value. Our marketing objectives are to generate qualified sales leads, enhance the global recognition and reputation of our brand and solutions, and establish Medidata as the premier provider of clinical trial solutions. Our principal marketing initiatives target key executives and decision makers within our existing and prospective customer base.
Customers
We are committed to developing long-term, partnering relationships with our customers located worldwide and working closely with customers to enable them to make optimal use of our systems for their development portfolios. Our customers include pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and diagnostics companies, institutions (which include academic research centers, government, and other non-profit organizations), CROs, and other entities engaged in conducting and/or sponsoring clinical trials. We work with large global pharmaceutical companies with worldwide footprints and clinical trials in multiple locations, as well as with start-up and mid-sized specialty, biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and medical device and diagnostic companies. We also work with government agencies that conduct or support the conduct of clinical trials.
We generate revenues from sales to new customers as well as sales and renewals from our existing customers. Our global direct sales organization represents our primary source of sales, with additional sales generated through our CRO relationships. As of December 31, 2016, we had 849 customers, including 17 of the top 25 global pharmaceutical companies.
Our five largest customers accounted for 26%, 24%, and 26% of our revenues in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues. At December 31, 2016, one customer comprised 13% of our accounts receivable. At December 31, 2015, another unrelated customer comprised 18% of our accounts receivable.
We sell our solutions and provide services globally. Approximately 23%, 24%, and 26% of our revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, were derived from international operations. A summary of our domestic and international revenues and long-term assets is set forth in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Segment and Geographic Information,” to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Backlog
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our total multi-year subscription backlog was $745 million and $555 million, respectively.
Total subscription backlog increases with the addition of new customer contracts, customer renewals, and contract modifications. It decreases with the recognition of revenue or contract modifications. The timing and duration of new contracts, renewals, contract modifications, and revenue recognition are variable and are not comparable year to year. Total subscription backlog is typically highest at the beginning of a contract and approaches zero prior to renewal. The level of total backlog is not an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue of that contract. The amount of total backlog associated with an existing multi-year contract may significantly vary year to year solely based on the status of renewal and have no significant impact on the amount of revenue attributable to that contract in a year-over-year comparison. Additionally, large multi-study deals may include provisions under which the customer contracts for a smaller amount of subscription services as they start the contract and the amount ramps up over the life of the contract; the result is an initial large increase in total subscription backlog that does not equate to a proportional increase in revenue in the subsequent period.
We also calculate a 12-month subscription backlog, which represents the future contract value of outstanding multi-study and single study arrangements, billed and unbilled, to be recognized in the next 12 months, excluding expected intra-year renewals and other adjustments. As of January 1, 2017 and 2016, we had 12-month subscription backlog of approximately $343 million and $296 million, respectively. We believe that 12-month subscription backlog is more easily reconciled to future revenues to be recognized than total backlog, and therefore is a more valuable metric for evaluation of expected future revenues.
Our presentation of backlog may differ from that of other companies in our industry.
Competition
The market for clinical trial solutions is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. It is subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, changes in laws and regulations, and frequent introductions of new products and services. We compete with firms such as Oracle, Parexel Informatics and others offering products and services that compete with one or more of our solutions.
5

We compete on the basis of several factors, including the following:

• | innovation, breadth and depth of solution offerings;


• | platform capabilities and solution functionality and features, including analytics;


• | workforce skill set;


• | scalability and upgrade pathways and support;


• | speed, performance, and ease of use of our solutions;


• | product reliability and infrastructure accessibility and security;


• | regulatory compliance;


• | breadth and strength of partnerships;


• | interoperability;


• | financial stability;


• | depth of expertise and quality of our global professional services and customer support; and


• | sales and marketing capabilities, including the ability to create and communicate operational value.

Although some of our competitors and potential competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more product offerings, and greater financial, technological, and other resources than we do, we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors.
Intellectual Property
Our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We rely upon a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, non-competition and assignment of inventions agreements. We have registered trademarks and service marks in the United States ("U.S.") and abroad, and filed applications for the registration of additional trademarks and service marks. Our principal trademarks are “Medidata,” "Medidata Solutions," "Medidata Clinical Cloud," "Medidata Patient Cloud," "Architecture of Hope," “Medidata CRO Contractor,” “Medidata Designer,” “Medidata Grants Manager,” “Medidata Rave,” "Medidata Balance," "Medidata Coder," and "Medidata Insights." We also hold several domain names, including the domain names “mdsol.com” and “medidatasolutions.com.” As of December 31, 2016, we hold 25 patents as well as numerous published patent applications outstanding in the United States and certain foreign countries.
The legal protections described above afford only limited protection for our technology. Due to rapid technological change, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product and service developments, and enhancements to existing products and services are more important than the various legal protections of our technology to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position.
Government and Other Regulations
Regulation of Clinical Trials and Electronic Systems Used in Clinical Trials
The conduct of clinical trials is subject to regulation and regulatory guidance associated with the approval of new drugs, biological products and medical devices imposed upon the clinical trial process by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), foreign governmental regulatory agencies and international non-governmental organizations, such as the International Conference on Harmonisation ("ICH").
The laws, regulations, and guidance from various countries and regions are often, but not always, harmonized. In those areas that are not yet harmonized, conflicting or even contradictory requirements may exist. Further, the regulatory environment and requirements for clinical trials and drug/biologic/device approvals are undergoing rapid change in the U.S., the European Union ("EU"), and other regions. We continue to monitor regulatory developments and industry best practices in these areas and make changes and introduce improvements as necessary to remain in compliance.
The use of our software products, services, and hosted solutions by customers engaged in clinical trials must be done in a manner that is compliant with a complex array of U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including regulation by the FDA, as well as regulations and guidance issued by foreign governments and international non-governmental organizations. Our applications have been designed to allow our customers to deploy such clinical trials as part of a validated system, compliant with applicable laws and regulations.
The use of software during the clinical trial process must adhere to the regulations and regulatory guidance known as Good Clinical Practices ("GCPs"), other various codified practices such as the Consolidated Guidance for Industry from the International Conference on Harmonisation Regarding Good Clinical Practices for Europe, the Asia Pacific region, and the Americas, and other guidance documents. In addition to these regulations and regulatory guidance, the FDA and regulatory authorities from other countries have developed regulations and regulatory guidance concerning electronic records and electronic signatures. In the U.S., this includes Title 21 Code of Federal Register ("CFR") Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures, which is further interpreted for clinical trials in a guidance document titled FDA Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Investigations—Guidance for Industry. In general, regulatory guidance stipulates that computerized systems used to capture or manage clinical trial data must meet certain standards for attributability, legibility, contemporaneousness, originality, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and availability, as well as integrity and security. If we or our customers violate the GCPs or other regulatory requirements, both parties run the risk that the violation will result 
6

in a regulatory citation, the suspension of the clinical trial, investigator disqualification or debarment, the rejection or withdrawal of a product marketing application, criminal prosecution, or civil penalties. Such risks not only impact our customers, but could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
Regulation of Health Information
Government regulation of the use and disclosure of subject (patient) privacy and data protection imposes a number of requirements. In the U.S., regulations issued pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), require certain “covered entities,” including facilities and providers that are involved in clinical trials, to comply with established standards regarding the privacy and security of protected health information, and to use standardized code sets when conducting certain electronic transactions. The regulations also require “business associates” that provide services on behalf of the covered entity to follow the same standards. Although we are not a “covered entity” or a “business associate” and therefore technically are not subject to HIPAA regulations, many users of our products and services are directly regulated under HIPAA and our products cannot be utilized in a manner that is inconsistent with the users' HIPAA compliance requirements. In addition, to the extent we perform functions or activities on behalf of customers that are directly regulated by such health-related privacy laws, we may be required to comply with a number of the same HIPAA requirements. The breach of such requirements on our part may result in liability to our customers and us. In addition to HIPAA, most states within the U.S. have enacted or are considering their own privacy and data protection laws. Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements and we must comply with them as well.
In addition to complying with the privacy laws in the U.S., many foreign governments have data privacy and data protection laws that include additional protections for customer end-user information and for sensitive patient information, including clinical data. Because our services are available to customers in many foreign countries, we must provide our services in a manner that supports our customers' compliance obligations. Foreign government data protection laws and regulations include the EU's Data Protection Directive ("95/46/EC"), European country-specific laws and regulations that implement that Directive, as well as the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 1,424 employees, of which 462 were employed at our headquarters in New York, 670 at other locations in the U.S., 150 in the United Kingdom, and 142 in the Asia Pacific region. As of December 31, 2016, we had 403 employees in customer services and support, 25 employees in data operations, 480 employees in research and development, 309 employees in sales and marketing, and 207 employees in administration and executive management. We also retain additional outside contractors from time to time to supplement our services and research and development staff on an as-needed basis. As of December 31, 2016, we had 261 independent contractors, the majority of which have been engaged in connection with help desk and customer service functions. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
