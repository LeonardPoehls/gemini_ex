 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
  Pacific Gold & Royalty Corp. (Pacific Gold or the Company) is engaged in the identification, acquisition, and development of mining prospects believed to have known gold, tungsten or uranium/vanadium mineral deposits. The main objective is to identify and develop commercially viable mineral deposits on prospects over which the company has rights that could produce revenues. Development of commercially viable mineral deposits of any metal includes a high degree of risk which careful evaluation, experience and factual knowledge may not eliminate, and therefore, we may never produce any significant revenues.  The Company was originally incorporated in Nevada on December 31, 1996 under the name of Demand Financial International, Ltd. On October 3, 2002, Demand Financial International, Ltd. changed its name to Blue Fish Entertainment, Inc. On August 5, 2003, the name was changed to Pacific Gold Corp. On August 22, 2017, the Company relocated its incorporation to the state of Wyoming and changed its name to Pacific Gold & Royalty Corp. Additionally, on August 22, 2017, the Company changed its authorized common shares to 50,000,000,000 and changed its common share par value to $0.00001. The effect of this change was retroactively applied to the December 31, 2016 common stock and additional paid-in capital.  On July 28th, 2017, the Company and the SEC settled an action brought by the SEC whereby the Company would consent to its deregistering of its common shares. On August 4, 2017 the Companys common shares were deregistered. On October 4th, 2017 the Company file a new 10-12G registration.  Projects and Royalties
  Black Rock Canyon Mine (formerly Nevada Rae Gold, Inc.)
  On July 15, 2015, the Company sold all of its interest in Nevada Rae Gold, Inc. and the Black Rock Canyon Mine for the following consideration: $300,000, which was all used to satisfy some of the immediate accounts payable of Nevada Rae Gold, Inc.; $100,000 that was paid to the Company in July 2016, of which $54,777 was used to satisfy remaining payroll liability taxes; and a royalty of 4% on all Nevada Rae Gold, Inc. gold sales up to a maximum royalty of $720,000. All of the payments are subject to a 10% finders fee which has not yet been paid.  Project W (formerly Pilot Mountain Resources Inc.)
  Pilot Mountain Resources Inc. (PMR) was merged into Pacific Gold & Royalty Corp. on September 30, 2013.  On February 8, 2011 the Company entered into an Option and Asset Sale Agreement with Pilot Metals Inc. for the purchase of Project W. The main terms called for a payment of $50,000 for a 100 day initial option for Pilot Metals Inc. to conduct due diligence. At the end of the option period Pilot Metals had the right to exercise a second option for $450,000. The Agreement called for further payments 2 years after the date of the second option of $500,000 (failing payment the Agreement would terminate) and further payments of $500,000 on the third anniversary and $500,000 on the fourth anniversary. On payment of the final $500,000 payment ownership would transfer to Pilot Metals. In lieu of making the final payment Pilot Metals could elect a joint venture with the Company. Additionally the Agreement called for a payment of $1,000,000 to the Company upon the commencement of commercial mining at Project W.  On February 25th, 2011 the Company confirmed payment of the initial $50,000 option fee.  On September 8, 2011 Pilot Metals elected to exercise the second option and made a payment to the Company of $450,000.  On July 2nd, 2013 the Company entered into an amendment of the original Agreement for the payments of $500,000 each on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th anniversaries to $350,000 on July 8, 2013, which was received by the Company, and $850,000 on March 31, 2014.  On February 18, 2014, the Company completed another amendment to its Option and Asset Sale Agreement with Pilot Metals Inc. As amended, instead of $850,000 to be paid on March 31, 2014 and $1,000,000 on the commencement of commercial mining, the Company received $200,000 on February 18, 2014 and received $400,000 on March 31, 2014, with $1,500,000 now to be received on the commencement of commercial mining.  The payments made to the Company from Pilot Metals Inc. are subject to a 15% secondary royalty to be paid from the Company to Platoro West, Inc.  On November 22, 2017, the Company executed an Agreement with Pilot Metals Inc. to sell its remaining royalty interest in Project W for $125,000.  3     Graysill Vanadium/Uranium Mining Claims
  The Company owns 40 unpatented federal lode mining claims, in San Juan and Dolores Counties, Colorado, staked in August 2006; immediately southeast of Bolam Pass. The lead claim file number for the file is San Juan County 145097 and Delores County 00150911.The claims are located within the San Juan Mountains, north of Durango, Colorado. The claims are situated on federal land. They cover approximately 800 acres of very rugged, mountainous terrain. The claims are subject to an annual renewal fee of $155 each, paid yearly by the Company to the BLM prior to September 1st of each year along with a notice of intent to hold the claims. The mining claims were acquired by staking land owned by the BLM. The staking process involved a physical visit to the site using a GPS to locate USGS corner posts and then placer location monuments at the 4 corners of each prospective claim. Subsequently a field map is prepared and then the claim location notices are filed with the proper county of location and once stamped by the county the claims are then submitted to the Colorado BLM with the appropriate location fee and advance renewal fee of $155 per claim for the subsequent year.  Description and Location
    4    The claims are located at an elevation of 11,000 feet above mean sea level and are accessible by a dirt road that is maintained during the summer months by the United States Forest Service. The property, which is referred to as the Graysill Property, encompasses the historic Graysill Mine, a past producer of vanadium and uranium ore. Based on generally available public information, the Graysill Mine is known to have produced vanadium and by-product uranium during a period of approximately twenty years after World War II. It is generally estimated that before the mine ceased production in the early 1960s, approximately 32,000 tons of ore were mined with a reported grade of approximately 2.41% vanadium pentoxide and 0.09% uranium oxide. No assurance can be given that these reportable grades will be matched in future explorations and operations if commenced.  Vanadium is primarily used as a steel additive to strengthen it. Vanadium also is compatible with titanium, therefore vanadium foil is used in cladding titanium to steel. Vanadium also is a suitable material for the inner structure of a fusion reactor. Several vanadium alloys show superconducting behavior. Certain vanadium oxides are used in chemical reactions for the production of other products, such as sulfuric acid, ceramics and glass coatings.  Uranium has many uses, notably in the energy and military sectors. Medical and scientific uses are also important within the uranium industry, including for medical diagnostics, cell and medical research and scientific dating.  The property is underlain by a gently dipping assemblage of Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks within which vanadium and uranium occurs in many of the rock units in a stratabound manner, exhibiting little or no apparent relationship to regional structural trends. Although vanadium and uranium occurrences are ubiquitous and are known to exist in over 20 distinctly different sedimentary units in the vicinity of the property of American Uranium, the Pennsylvanian-Permian Rico Formation and the Upper Jurassic Entrada Sandstone are the only formations which have been mined previously for vanadium and uranium. Most of the past production has come from the Entrada Sandstone. Historically, there have been a number of uraniferous vanadium deposits developed in the Entrada Sandstone along a sinuous trend extending in a north-south direction for over 100 miles. This trend coincides with a major structural feature representing a transitional zone between the Colorado Plateau and the Southern Rocky Mountain physiographic provinces.  There is no modern determination of mineral reserves, which means there is no current evaluation of the economic or legally extractable or producible mineral deposits within the claims owned by the Company.  The Company has not completed any work on the property aside from an on-site inspection by a mining engineer.  There are currently no usable facilities or infrastructure on the property.  The Company has begun its exploration and development program as outlined below under the heading Business Plan.  No sources of water or power have yet been secured or identified at the property.
  A geologist consulting firm, World Industrial Minerals, in April 2012, performed various evaluations of the Graysill uranium - vanadium mine located in Dolores and San Juan Counties Colorado USA. The engagement is broken into several phases, set forth below, and each is dependent on the successful completion of the earlier phases and the existence of positive results that justify the next phases. The engagement of the above firm is on the basis of a general work order for specific tasks. In the case of phase one, the company and the consulting firm agreed upon the work to be done and the time frame. There is no long term contract. The company is not obligated to continue to engage the above firm for future phases of the evaluation process, and the company believes that there are other firms available to carry out all or portions of the continued evaluative work. Therefore, investors should understand that at any point in the geological evaluation, it may be determined not to proceed, and in that case the expense of the evaluation will not be recoverable.  · Phase 1: Detailed research of the existing mine, including the geology and potential for ultimate production. This phase will include location and assessment of all available literature on the existing mine and provision of a summary report of the findings. This report will include recommendations about the future work to be performed in respect of the exploration and production of the property. This report will also suggest budgeting requirements for the subsequent phases. · Phase 2: Field Evaluation of property and mine during summer field season. This work will be directed by results of research phase. · Phase 3: Exploration program  drilling, sampling of old workings. This work will be directed by results of the field evaluation. Because of the short field season, it is possible that certain samplings by drilling may take place before the commencement of phase two. · Phase 4: Prepare NI-43-101 Report of exploration efforts.   5     Phase one was completed in May 2012, and the Company is now evaluating the report assessing the availability of information about the claims and the recommendations for the next phases of work that needs to be done.  The cost of phase one of the project was $21,000 and included all customary expenses (phone, report preparation, map work etc.). The costs for phases two through four will each be dependent on the results of the prior phase of work being completed and the recommendations of the consultant geologists.  After assessment of the phase one report, together with the test results, the Company has determined that Phase 2 and 3 should proceed. The Company will have to pursue fund raising activities to fund the exploration it plans to implement. Because it is very early stages of the exploration phases and the overall viability of the mining property has not been assessed, the Company has not developed a full plan or budget. Investors should be aware that as an early exploratory company, there may not be any conclusive results or the results of the initial exploration will indicate that the mining property is not viable. Therefore, investors will not be able to realize any gain on their investment.  Competition
  Currently, we do not have any direct competition with respect to the specific claims that the Company owns. Within the industry of vanadium and uranium, if we were to develop production capacity, the Company would compete with other suppliers of these minerals. Because minerals are sourced world-wide, our competition would include companies operating in diverse locations such as Africa, Australia, the Peoples Republic of China and the Americas. The companies that commonly are producing minerals of this nature are large capitalization companies, with established mining clams and operations. Their deposits are often refined and sold through related parties or to and through companies with which they have long standing relationships. In some countries which are seeking to develop their mineral resource capabilities, there are direct and indirect subsidies and supports that give these producers market advantage. In the United States, we will also have to face the competitive differential imposed by a body of sophisticated, comprehensive environmental laws that cover mining, transportation, refining and distribution of minerals. Additionally, since there are dangerous aspects to the operation of shaft mining and associated with vanadium and uranium, there is a body of worker protection and similar laws that we will have to comply with. These may be more restrictive and costly rules than our competitors have to follow, which would make our operations more expensive and less competitive in the world market.  In terms of developing our business plan and conducting exploration and later mineral deposit development, we also expect to compete for qualified geological and environmental experts to assist us in our exploration of mining prospects, as well as any other consultants, employees and equipment that we may require in order to conduct our operations.  Currently, there is significant competition for financial capital to be deployed in mining and mineral extraction, particularly in relation to the oil and gas extractive industries. Therefore, it is difficult for smaller mineral companies such as Pacific Metals to attract investment for its exploration activities. We cannot give any assurances that we will be able to compete for capital funds, and without adequate financial resources management cannot assure that the company will be able to compete in exploration activities and ultimately in mineral deposit development, production and sales.  Regulation
  The exploration and development of a mining prospect is subject to regulation by a number of federal and state government authorities. These include the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Bureau of Land Management as well as the various state environmental protection agencies. The regulations address many environmental issues relating to air, soil and water contamination and apply to many mining related activities including exploration, mine construction, mineral extraction, ore milling, water use, waste disposal and use of toxic substances. In addition, we are subject to regulations relating to labor standards, occupational health and safety, mine safety, general land use, export of minerals and taxation. Many of the regulations require permits or licenses to be obtained and the filing of Notices of Intent and Plans of Operations, the absence of which or inability to obtain will adversely affect the ability for us to conduct our exploration, development and operation activities. The failure to comply with the regulations and terms of permits and licenses may result in fines or other penalties or in revocation of a permit or license or loss of a prospect.  For the purposes of exploration drilling, the company will be subject to the approval of a plan of operations submitted to the US Forest Service and/or the BLM. Additionally, the plan of operations for exploration drilling will have to be approved by the Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Once the plan of operations is approved by these agencies, the company must post a bond with the state prior to commencing any exploration work that disturbs the ground in a material manner, which bond amount will cover reclaimation and other costs in the event the Company fails to act in accordance with its plan.  6     The preparation and filing of the plan of operations for exploration drilling and the associated permitting is not difficult process because of the limited intrusion into the land. The Company believes that once it has the necessary reports that it will be able to formulate a plan and obtain the necessary permits. The permits related to the number of drill sites, the location, and the extent of the drilling, as well as the expected disruption to the land and the necessary steps for reclaimation.  In the future, if and when the Company progresses to establishing a mining operation, in order to begin operating a mine, the Company must have an approved plan of operations with the US Forest Service and/or BLM, an approved Air permit with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, an approved water pollution control permit with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, an approved and acceptable bond with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and US Forest Service and/or BLM, any business license required by the relevant counties and must also abide by al Mine Safety and Health Agency regulations. The Colorado Division of Reclamation has permitting oversight on all reclamation plans. Since the minerals include some that are may be radioactive, the company will also have to comply with the regulation of radioactive materials of the State of Colorado, which will be an added permitting process within the overall plan of operations for an operating mine. Before the plan of operations will be filed, the company will have to arrange for a source of water, develop a water pollution control system, and develop a air pollution control system, in addition to all the other aspects of opening a mine for operations.  We must comply with the annual staking and patent maintenance requirements of the State of Colorado and the United States Bureau of Land Management, which included the payment of the annual renewal fee for each claim. We must also comply with the filing requirements of our proposed exploration and development, including Notices of Intent and Plans of Operations. In connection with our exploration and assessment activities, we have pursued necessary permits where exemptions have not been available although, to date, most of these activities have been done under various exemptions. We will need to file for water use and other extractive-related permits in the future.  Employees
  Pacific Gold & Royalty Corp. has one employee who is the executive officer. From time to time we hire heavy machinery operators, geological experts, engineers and other operations consultants and independent contractors and laborers, for differing periods to facilitate the implementation of our business plan.
