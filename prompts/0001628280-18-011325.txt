Item 1. Business
Overview of Oclaro
During our fiscal year 2018, we were one of the leading providers of optical components and modules for the long-haul, metro and data center markets. Leveraging more than three decades of laser technology innovation and photonics integration, we provide differentiated solutions for optical networks and high-speed interconnects driving the next wave of streaming video, cloud computing, application virtualization and other bandwidth-intensive and high-speed applications.
Corporate Information
We were incorporated in Delaware in June 2004. On September 10, 2004, we became the publicly traded parent company of the Oclaro Technology Ltd (formerly Bookham Technology plc) group of companies, including Oclaro Technology Ltd, a limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales whose stock was previously traded on the London Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ National Market under the Bookham name. Effective January 3, 2011, our common stock was traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “OCLR.”
Our principal executive offices are located at 225 Charcot Avenue, San Jose, California 95131, and our telephone number at that location is (408) 383-1400. We maintain a web site with the address www.oclaro.com. Our website includes links to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charters.

Our Business 
We are a supplier of core optical network technology to leading telecommunications and data communications ("datacom") equipment companies and to data center and network operators worldwide. We primarily target communications equipment manufacturers that integrate our optical technology into the switching, routing and transport systems they offer to the global service and content providers that are building, upgrading and operating high-performance optical networks. Service and content providers are increasingly demanding greater levels of network capacity from their communications equipment suppliers, our primary customers, in order to meet their rapidly growing network bandwidth requirements. This capacity need is being driven by bandwidth intensive applications and devices that are at the access or edge of the network, such as all forms of mobile devices, streaming video, social media and cloud computing. 
The optical communications market has started to expand beyond a small number of very large service providers, and is now transitioning to a variety of open and captive networks created solely for in house use by large video services, search engines and companies offering a variety of cloud computing services. We believe that the trend toward an increase in demand for optical solutions, which increase network capacity, is in response to growing bandwidth demand driven by increased transmission of video, voice and data over optical communications networks. Service providers also seek to decrease the total cost of ownership of their networks. Many of our advanced optical solutions are implemented in emerging network architectures, helping to provide a level of flexibility and responsiveness that enables savings in both operational and capital expenses. The rapid development of network infrastructure underway in developing countries is also driving growth in demand for optical solutions. Increasingly, internet content providers with their own wide area networks have similar requirements and are also becoming customers for our optical network products. We design, manufacture and market optical components and modules that generate, modulate and detect light signals in optical communications networks. During fiscal year 2018, we were a leading supplier of optical products at the component level, including fixed and tunable lasers, external modulators, integrated lasers and modulators and receivers. During fiscal year 2018, we were also a leading supplier of products at the module level, including transceivers. Many of our products enable increased flexibility in optical communications networks, making the networks more dynamic in nature. We supply transmission products at the component level and the module level into 10 gigabits per second ("Gb/s"), 100 Gb/s, 200 Gb/s and 400 Gb/s optical communications solutions.

Additionally, in datacom, enterprises and institutions such as data centers have grown in complexity as they manage the rapidly escalating demands for increased bandwidth and diverse types of data driven through the consumerization of information technology and the transition to Software as a Service ("SaaS") services. These next generation architectures, such as hyperscale data centers, require very high speed interconnects to support intensive data traffic within and between data centers. The providers of hyperscale data centers are upgrading and deploying their own high speed local, storage and wide-area networks, also called LANs, SANs and WANs, respectively. These deployments increase the ability to utilize high-bandwidth applications that are growing in importance to their organizations and also increase utilization across telecommunications networks as this traffic leaves the LANs, SANs and WANs and travels over the network service providers’ edge and core networks. We are a leading supplier of client-side and short reach optical transceivers and lasers operating over single-mode fiber at 10 Gb/s, 25 Gb/s and 100-400 Gb/s into datacom and enterprise solutions.
Furthermore, the increasing need for bandwidth to the home, particularly in the Multi Service Operators (cable) ("MSO") networks globally, requires a network architecture shift away from analog to a digital infrastructure. Remote Phy is seen as an efficient way to enable MSO’s to offer new and differentiated high bandwidth services. Our tunable transceivers provide significant operational savings to cable operators as they transition to a digital architecture.
Demand for mobile connectivity is increasing rapidly across a growing range of devices, from phones to tablet computers. Mobile infrastructure providers wishing to enable consumers to use bandwidth intensive applications such as video streaming must implement optical solutions from the mast head to a remote terminal and/or central office. We are a supplier of optical transceivers at speeds up to 100 Gb/s into the wireless 3G, 4G and fronthaul and backhaul markets, as well as supplying transceivers for initial field trials and deployment of 5G networks.
For the years ended June 30, 2018, July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016, our revenues were $543.2 million, $601.0 million and $407.9 million, respectively. We had net income of $62.5 million, $127.9 million and $8.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2018, July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016, respectively. As of June 30, 2018, July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016, our total assets were $720.8 million, $665.1 million and $359.0 million, respectively. 
Merger
On March 11, 2018, Lumentum Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Lumentum”), Oclaro, Prota Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Lumentum (“Merger Sub”), and Prota Merger, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Lumentum (“Merger Sub LLC”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”).
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the acquisition of Oclaro will be accomplished through a merger of Merger Sub with and into Oclaro (the “First Step Merger”) with Oclaro surviving the First Step Merger. As soon as reasonably practicable following the First Step Merger, Oclaro will merge with and into Merger Sub LLC with Merger Sub LLC continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Lumentum (the “Second Step Merger,” and taken together with the First Step Merger, the “Merger”).
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, at the effective time of the First Step Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of the common stock of Oclaro (the “Oclaro Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (x) shares of Oclaro Common Stock owned by Lumentum, Oclaro, or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Lumentum or Oclaro or (y) shares of Oclaro Common Stock owned by stockholders who have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive the following consideration (collectively, the “Merger Consideration”):
(A) $5.60 in cash, without interest (the “Cash Consideration”), plus
(B) 0.0636 of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the common stock of Lumentum, par value $0.001 per share (“Lumentum Common Stock”) (such ratio, the “Exchange Ratio”).
With regard to the Merger Consideration, if the aggregate number of shares of Lumentum Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger (including all Lumentum Common Stock which may be issued in the future pursuant to the conversion of Oclaro Options, Oclaro Restricted Stock Units, or Oclaro Restricted Stock (as defined below) would exceed 19.9 percent of the Lumentum Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Stock Threshold”), (A) the Exchange Ratio will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (rounded down to the nearest one thousandth) such that the aggregate number of shares of Lumentum Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger (including all shares of Lumentum Common Stock which may be issued after the Effective Time pursuant to company compensatory awards) does not exceed the Stock Threshold and (B) the Cash Consideration for all purposes will be increased on a per share basis by an amount equal to $68.975, multiplied by the difference between the initial Exchange Ratio and the Exchange Ratio.
5

Each Oclaro restricted stock unit award (an “Oclaro RSU”) that does not become vested at the closing will be converted into a Lumentum restricted stock unit award (a “Lumentum RSU”) with the same terms and conditions, including vesting, that were applicable to such Oclaro RSU, except that the number of Lumentum shares subject to the Lumentum RSU will equal the product of (i) the number of Oclaro shares subject to such Oclaro RSU (with any performance milestones deemed achieved based on the maximum level of achievement) multiplied by (ii) the sum of (A) the Exchange Ratio plus (B) the quotient obtained by dividing the Cash Consideration by Lumentum’s average closing price of the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the closing (such sum, the “Equity Award Exchange Ratio”), rounded down to the nearest whole share.
Each Oclaro stock option (an “Oclaro Option”), whether vested or unvested, will be converted into a Lumentum stock option (a “Lumentum Option”) with the same terms and conditions, including vesting, that were applicable to such Oclaro Option, except that (i) the number of shares subject to the Lumentum Option will equal the product of (A) the number of Oclaro shares subject to such Oclaro Option multiplied by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share and (ii) the exercise price of the Lumentum Option will equal (A) the exercise price per share of the Oclaro Option divided by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Oclaro Option that is held by an individual who is not an Oclaro employee as of immediately prior to the closing will be cancelled and converted into the Merger Consideration for each net option share covered by such Oclaro Option, subject to applicable withholding taxes.
In addition, each Oclaro restricted stock award (“Oclaro Restricted Stock Award”) and Oclaro RSU that becomes vested as of immediately prior to the closing (including each Oclaro Restricted Stock Award held by a non-employee director) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each Oclaro share underlying such award, subject to applicable withholding taxes. Each Oclaro stock appreciation right (“Oclaro SAR”) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the number of Oclaro shares subject to the Oclaro SAR multiplied by (ii) the positive difference of (A) the cash equivalent value of the Merger Consideration less (B) the strike price of the Oclaro SAR, subject to applicable withholding taxes.
If Lumentum determines that the treatment of Oclaro equity awards described above would violate, in respect of the holder thereof, the applicable laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction, Lumentum may treat such Oclaro equity award in a different manner so long as such treatment is no less favorable to the holder of such Oclaro equity award.
The Boards of Directors of Lumentum and Oclaro have unanimously approved the Merger and the Merger Agreement. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the absence of certain legal impediments, the expiration or termination of the required waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act") and under applicable anti-trust laws in China, the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 registering the shares of Lumentum common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger, and approval of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Oclaro Common Stock. The transaction is not subject to any financing condition. On April 4, 2018, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act. On July 10, 2018, Oclaro's stockholders approved the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of Lumentum, Oclaro, Merger Sub and Merger Sub LLC, including, (i) covenants by Oclaro concerning the conduct of its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger, (ii) covenants by Lumentum concerning the conduct of its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger, (iii) a covenant by Oclaro that, subject to certain exceptions, the Board of Directors of Oclaro will recommend to its shareholders adoption of the Merger Agreement, and (iv) a covenant that Oclaro will not solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or induce the making of inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Lumentum and Oclaro and further provides that upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances (including termination by Oclaro to accept a superior proposal), Oclaro may be required to pay Lumentum a termination fee of $63 million. The Merger Agreement further provides that upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances relating to failure to obtain regulatory approvals, Lumentum may be required to pay Oclaro a termination fee of $80 million.
During the year ended June 30, 2018, we recorded acquisition-related costs of $4.3 million in restructuring, acquisition and related (income) expense, net, within our consolidated statements of operations.

Manufacturing
We have wafer fabrication facilities in Caswell, U.K.; Sagamihara, Japan; and San Donato, Italy. We also have facilities in Shenzhen, China; Sagamihara, Japan; and San Donato, Italy, where we perform assembly and test operations. We believe that innovation at the wafer and fab level is a key differentiator in optical components and we are positioned accordingly. We also use third-party contract manufacturers in Asia, and continually evaluate the capabilities of additional potential contract manufacturing partners to ensure we have a scalable and cost effective manufacturing strategy appropriate for executing our business objectives over a long-term horizon.
We believe our wafer fabrication facilities position us well to introduce product innovations delivering optical network cost and performance advantages to our customers. We also believe that our ability to deliver innovative technologies in a variety of form factors, ranging from chip level to component level to module level, allows us to address the needs of a broad base of potential customers regardless of their desired level of product integration or complexity.
We believe our advanced chip and component design and manufacturing facilities would be very expensive to replicate. On-chip, or monolithic, integration of functionality is more difficult to achieve without control over the production process, and requires advanced process know-how and equipment. Although the market for optical integrated circuits is still in its early stages, it shares many characteristics with the semiconductor market, including the positive relationship between the number of features integrated on a chip, the wafer size and the cost and sophistication of the fabrication equipment. We believe our wafer fabrication facilities and our know-how provide a competitive advantage by allowing us to increase the complexity of the optical circuits that we design and manufacture, and the integration of photonics components within smaller packages, without the relatively high cost, power and size issues associated with less integrated solutions.

Our research and development organization has optical and electronic integration expertise that facilitates meeting customer-specific requirements as they arise.

Our competitive position significantly depends upon our research, development, engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, and not just on our patent position. However, obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights, including patents, provides us with a further competitive advantage. In the appropriate circumstances, these rights can help us to obtain entry into new markets by providing consideration for cross-licenses. In other circumstances, they can be used to prevent competitors from copying our products or from using our inventions. Accordingly, our practice is to file patent applications in the United States and certain other countries for inventions that we consider significant. In addition to patents, we also possess other intellectual property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets, design rights and copyrights.
We have a substantial number of patents in the United States and other countries, and additional applications are pending. These relate to technology that we have obtained from our acquisitions of businesses and companies in addition to our own internally developed technology. As of June 30, 2018, we held approximately 1,000 issued patents worldwide, with additional patent applications pending in various jurisdictions. Although our business is not materially dependent upon any one patent, our rights and the products made and sold under our patents, taken as a whole, are a significant element of our business. We maintain an active program designed to identify technology appropriate for patent protection. 
We require employees and consultants to execute appropriate non-disclosure and proprietary rights agreements. These agreements acknowledge our exclusive ownership of intellectual property developed for us and require that all proprietary information disclosed remain confidential. While such agreements are intended to be binding, we may not be able to enforce these agreements in all jurisdictions. Although we continue to take steps to identify and protect our patentable technology and to obtain and protect proprietary rights to our technology, we cannot be certain the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology, especially in certain countries where the legal protections of intellectual property are still developing. We may take legal action to enforce our patents and trademarks and other intellectual property rights. However, legal action may not always be successful or appropriate, and may be costly. Further, situations may arise in which we may decide to grant intellectual property licenses to third parties, in which case other parties will be able to exploit our technology in the marketplace.
We enter into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when management determines that it is in our best interest to do so. For example, see our risk factor “Our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could result in materially expensive litigation or require us to obtain a license to use the technology from third parties, or we may be prohibited from selling certain products in the future” appearing in Item 1A of this Annual Report. These may result in net royalties payable to us by third parties or by us to third parties. However, royalties received from or paid to third parties to date have not been material to our consolidated results of operations.

In the normal course of business, we periodically receive and make inquiries regarding possible patent infringement. In dealing with such inquiries, it may become necessary or useful for us to obtain or grant licenses or other rights. However, there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are not able to resolve or settle claims, obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, and/or successfully prosecute or defend our position, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Competition
The optical communications markets are rapidly evolving. We expect these markets to continue to be highly competitive because of the available capacity and number of competitors. We compete with domestic and international companies, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. As of June 30, 2018, we believe that our principal competitors in the optical subsystems, modules and components industry include Acacia Communications, Inc., Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., Finisar Corporation ("Finisar"), Fujitsu Limited ("Fujitsu"), InnoLight Technology Ltd., Lumentum, NeoPhotonics Corporation ("NeoPhotonics"), Source Photonics Inc. and Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. The principal competitive factors upon which we compete include breadth of product line, availability, performance, product reliability, innovation and selling price. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering high levels of customer value through collaborative product design, technology innovation, manufacturing capabilities, optical/mechanical performance, intelligent features for configuration, control and monitoring, multi-function integration and overall customization. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete favorably with respect to these factors. We encounter substantial competition in most of our markets, although no one competitor competes with us across all product lines or markets.
Consolidation in the optical systems and components industry has intensified the competitive pressures that we face. For example, ADVA announced the acquisition of MRV Communications, Inc. in 2017, Fujitsu announced the acquisition of a 51 percent stake in FITEC Corp. in 2017, APAT Optoelectronics acquired the access and low speed transceiver business from NeoPhotonics in 2017, Avago acquired Broadcom Corp. in 2016, Nokia acquired Alcatel-Lucent in 2016, Ciena acquired Cyan Inc. in 2015, NeoPhotonics acquired the tunable laser product line of Emcore Corporation in 2015, Finisar acquired u2t Photonics AG in 2014 and Avago acquired CyOptics, Inc. in 2013. On March 11, 2018, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Lumentum, pursuant to which we have agreed to be acquired by Lumentum. 
We also face competition from companies that may expand into our industry and introduce additional competitive products. Existing and potential customers are also our potential competitors. These customers may internally develop or acquire additional competitive products or technologies, which may cause them to reduce or cease their purchases from us (for example, Cisco's acquisition of Lightwire, Inc., Ciena's acquisition of TeraXion, and Juniper Networks' acquisition of Aurrion, Inc.).
