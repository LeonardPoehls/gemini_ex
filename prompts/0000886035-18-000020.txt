ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General Cable Corporation ("the Company") is a global leader in the development, design, manufacture, marketing and distribution of copper, aluminum and fiber optic wire and cable products for use in the energy, industrial, construction, automotive, specialty and communications markets. The Company additionally engages in the design, integration, and installation on a turn-key basis for products such as high and extra-high voltage terrestrial and submarine systems. 
On December 3, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), among the Company, Prysmian S.p.A., a company organized under the laws of the Republic of Italy (“Parent”), and Alisea Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Company (each, a “Share”), except for certain excluded shares, will automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive $30.00 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”). See Note 3 - Merger Agreement with Prysmian S.p.A. for additional details.
The Company remains committed to executing the guiding principles set forth by the Company as follows: 

• | Executing the implementation of the Company's strategy to deliver increased operating income margins and returns from the Company's core strategic operations in North America, Latin America and Europe by leveraging economies of scale and capitalizing on the Company's leading positions across key markets where the Company has built long-standing customer relationships, efficient supply chains and a wide range of product offerings;


• | Capitalizing on the Company's leading market positions to benefit from key end markets, such as electric utility, industrial and communications;


• | Strengthening and expanding customer relationships by providing high quality product lines and customer service;


• | Continuing to increase cash flow through operational excellence by leveraging the Company's operating systems, logistical expertise, Lean Six Sigma manufacturing tools and techniques to improve the Company's cost position to increase margins and delivering improved returns through restructuring initiatives;


• | Managing the Company's product portfolio by pursuing market share in faster growing and value added product lines;


• | Enhancing organization capabilities by leveraging the Company's diversity and intellectual property through the sharing of best practices across the organization; and


• | Cultivating a high performance culture with focus on operational execution, compliance, sustainability, safety, and innovation.

By operating under these guiding principles, the Company has been able to build a strong market position in the areas in which it competes. These guiding principles are the foundation of the Company's strategic roadmap developed in 2015 that focuses on optimization of the portfolio, developing leading cost and efficiency positions, growth through innovation and cultivation of a high-performance culture. The Company achieved significant progress in the execution of the strategic roadmap designed to transform the Company into a more focused, efficient and innovative organization. While the Company is benefiting from these significant operational and financial performance improvements, current dynamics in the industry are partially offsetting those accomplishments.
The Company considers its key performance indicators to be volume, as measured in metal pounds sold, operating income, net income, adjusted operating income, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), earnings per share, operating cash flows, cash conversion, working capital efficiency and returns on capital employed and invested capital.
The Company is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated in 1994. The Company and its predecessors have served various wire and cable markets for over 150 years. The Company's immediate predecessor was a unit of American Premier Underwriters, Inc. (“American Premier”), previously known as The Penn Central Corporation. American Premier acquired the Company's existing wire and cable business in 1981. In 1994, a subsidiary of Wassall PLC acquired the predecessor by purchase of General Cable's outstanding subordinated promissory note, the General Cable common stock held by American Premier and a tender offer for the publicly-held General Cable common stock. In 1997, Wassall consummated public offerings for the sale of all of its interest in General Cable's common stock. The Company has operated as an independent public company since completion of the offerings and its common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol, BGC.
For purposes of this report, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the “Company,” “General Cable,” “we,” “us,” and “our” shall refer to General Cable Corporation and its subsidiaries.

Customers
The Company has a regionally coordinated direct sales force and in certain of its businesses operates under supply agreements of varying lengths. These agreements generally do not require a minimum level of sales and customers are not contractually obligated to buy the Company's products exclusively; however, these agreements generally provide adjustments to selling prices to reflect fluctuations in the cost of raw materials and typically have one to four year terms. The primary agreements are strategic alliances with a number of major utility customers and respective markets. The Company sells direct to utilities, independent distributors, retailers, contractors, and OEMs. 
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used by the Company in the manufacturing of its wire and cable products are copper and aluminum. The Company's products are material intensive with copper and aluminum comprising the major cost components for cable products. At current metal prices, material costs are approximately 85% of total product costs with copper and aluminum metal costs comprising approximately 50% of total product costs for the year ended December 31, 2017. The average price of copper and aluminum based on the London Metal Exchange (“LME”) and Commodity Exchange, Inc ("COMEX") per quarter for the last three years is: 

 | Quarter 1 | Quarter 2 | Quarter 3 | Quarter 4 | Full Year
Copper Cathode | | | | | 
2017 | $2.65 | $2.58 | $2.89 | $3.10 | $2.80 
2016 | 2.11 | 2.13 | 2.16 | 2.39 | 2.20 
2015 | 2.66 | 2.77 | 2.40 | 2.20 | 2.51 
Aluminum | | | | | 
2017 | 0.94 | 0.96 | 0.99 | 1.05 | 0.98 
2016 | 0.77 | 0.79 | 0.80 | 0.85 | 0.80 
2015 | 1.04 | 0.92 | 0.80 | 0.76 | 0.88 

The price of copper and aluminum as traded on the LME and COMEX has historically been subject to considerable volatility. Volatility in the price of copper and aluminum and other raw materials, as well as fuel and energy, may in turn lead to significant fluctuations in our cost of sales or revenues. A significant portion of the Company's electric utility and telecommunications business and, to a lesser extent, the Company's electrical infrastructure business has metal escalators and de-escalators included in customer contracts under a variety of price setting and recovery formulas. The remainder of the Company's business requires that volatility in the cost of metals be recovered through negotiated price changes with customers. In these instances, the ability to change the Company's selling prices may lag the movement in metal prices by a period of time as the customer price changes are implemented. 
Therefore, in the short-term, during periods of escalating raw material cost inputs, to the extent the Company is able to increase prices in the market to recover the higher raw material costs, the Company will generally experience an increase in gross profit from the sale of its relatively lower value inventory as computed under the weighted average inventory costing method. If the Company is unable to increase prices with the rise in the raw material market prices due to low levels of demand or market dynamics, the Company will experience lower gross profit. Conversely, during periods of declining raw material cost inputs, to the extent the Company has to decrease prices in the market due to competitive pressure as the current cost of metals declines, the Company will generally experience downward pressure on its gross profit due to the sale of relatively higher value inventory as computed under the weighted average inventory costing method. If the Company is able to maintain price levels in an environment in which raw material prices are declining due to high levels of demand, the Company will experience higher gross profit. There is no exact future measure of the effect to the Company's profitability of the change of raw material cost inputs due to the unique set of selling variables and the high volume of transactions in any given period, each of which involves numerous individual pricing decisions. In 2017, if there were a 10% increase in copper and aluminum costs, then our cost of sales would have increased approximately $171 million. The impact of this would directly impact gross profit if the Company was unable to increase prices with the rise in the price of copper and aluminum. To help reduce this volatility, the Company has implemented various pricing mechanisms and hedges a portion of its metal purchases when there is a firm price commitment for a future delivery but does not engage in speculative metals trading. 
The Company purchases copper and aluminum from various global sources, generally through annual supply agreements. These agreements do not contractually obligate the Company to purchase products exclusively, or require the Company to purchase products for a significant period of time. Copper and aluminum raw material supply is available from many sources and supply is generally expected to remain adequate for the Company's requirements, however, unanticipated problems with the Company's copper or aluminum rod suppliers could negatively affect the Company's business. The Company has centralized purchasing of its copper, aluminum and other significant raw materials to capitalize on economies of scale and to facilitate the negotiation of purchase terms from suppliers. In North America, the Company's largest supplier of copper accounted for approximately 70% of 
 7

its total copper purchases while the largest supplier of aluminum accounted for approximately 60% of its total aluminum purchases. In Europe, the Company's largest supplier of copper accounted for approximately 45% of its total copper purchases while the largest supplier of aluminum accounted for approximately 30% of its total aluminum purchases. In Latin America, the Company’s largest supplier of copper accounted for approximately 75% of its total copper purchases while the largest supplier of aluminum accounted for approximately 30% of its total aluminum purchases.
Other raw materials utilized by the Company include nylon, polyethylene resin and compounds and plasticizers, fluoropolymer compounds, optical fiber and a variety of filling, binding and sheathing materials. The Company believes that all of these materials are available in sufficient quantities through purchases in the open market. 
Foreign Currency
The Company's results are directly influenced by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Uncertainty in the global market conditions has resulted in significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. This volatility results in gains / losses on transactions whose terms are denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency and the Company's consolidated results are influenced by the translation of the international units' results to U.S. dollars. To help reduce this volatility, the Company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Patents and Trademarks
The Company believes that the success of its business depends more on the technical competence, creativity and marketing abilities of its employees rather than on any individual patent, trademark or copyright. Nonetheless, the Company has a policy of seeking patents when appropriate on inventions concerning new products and product improvements. The Company owns numerous patents and trademarks globally, with pending applications for additional patents and trademarks, and maintains trade secret protection for certain confidential and proprietary information. 
Although in the aggregate these patents are of considerable importance to the manufacturing and marketing of many of the Company's products, the Company does not consider any single patent to be material to its business as a whole. Trademarks and trade names, which are important to the Company, are General Cable®, Anaconda® Brand, Carol® Brand, GenSPEED® Brand, NextGen® Brand, NSW® Brand, NUAL® Brand, Prestolite Wire® Brand, Silec® Brand, STABILOY® Brand and the Company's triad symbol. The Company believes that products bearing these trademarks have achieved significant brand recognition within the industry. 
Seasonality
The Company generally has experienced and expects to continue to experience certain seasonal trends in many products in which demand is linked with construction spending. Demand for these products during winter months in certain geographies is usually lower than demand during spring and summer months. Therefore, larger amounts of working capital are generally required during winter months in order to build inventories in anticipation of higher demand during the spring and summer months, when construction activity increases. In turn, receivables related to higher sales activity during the spring and summer months are generally collected during the fourth quarter of the year. Additionally, the Company has historically experienced changes in demand resulting from poor or unusual weather. 
Competition
The markets for all of the Company's products are highly competitive and most markets include several competitors. The degree of competition varies by operating segment and product line. However, in general, the industry is mature and cost driven. Although the primary competitive factors for the Company's products vary somewhat across the different product categories, the principal factors influencing competition include, but are not limited to, price, quality, breadth of product line, inventory, delivery time, customer service, the environmental impact of the products, and the ability to meet customers' needs. 
Many of the Company's products are made to industry specifications, and are therefore functionally interchangeable with those of competitors. However, the Company believes that significant opportunities exist to differentiate all of its products on the basis of quality, consistent availability, conformance to manufacturer's specifications and customer service. The Company believes its competitive strengths include breadth of product line, brand recognition, distribution and logistics, strong customer relations, operating efficiency and commitment to quality control and continuous improvement. 
Advertising Expense
Advertising expense consists of expenses to promote the Company’s products, including trade shows, catalogs, and e-commerce promotions, and is charged to expense when incurred. Advertising expense was $6.4 million, $7.9 million and $10.4 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Environmental Matters
The Company is subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations covering the storage, handling, emission and discharge of materials into the environment, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act (including the 1990 amendments) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. While it is difficult to estimate future environmental liabilities accurately, the Company does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows as a result of compliance with federal, state, local or foreign environmental laws or regulations or remediation costs of the sites as discussed in Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies.
Employees
At December 31, 2017, General Cable employed approximately 8,500 employees worldwide. Approximately 45% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements, of which approximately 40% are subject to agreements that expire within one year from December 31, 2017. The Company believes it will successfully renegotiate these contracts as they come due. Generally, labor agreements are negotiated on an annual or bi-annual basis. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are generally good.
