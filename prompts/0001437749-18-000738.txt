Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

National Holdings Corporation (“National,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation organized in 1996, operates through its wholly-owned subsidiaries which principally provide financial services. Through our broker-dealer and investment advisory subsidiaries, we (1) offer full service retail brokerage to individual, corporate and institutional clients, (2) provide investment banking, merger and acquisition and advisory services to micro, small and mid-cap high growth companies, (3) engage in trading securities, including making markets in micro and small-cap NASDAQ and other exchange listed stocks and (4) provide liquidity in the United States Treasury marketplace.
 
Our broker-dealer subsidiaries consist of National Securities Corporation, a Washington corporation (“National Securities” or “NSC”), and vFinance Investments, Inc., a Florida corporation (“vFinance Investments”) (collectively, the “Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries”). The Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries conduct a national securities brokerage business through their main offices in New York City, New York; Boca Raton, Florida; and Seattle, Washington. Our Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries are introducing brokers and clear all transactions through clearing organizations, on a fully disclosed basis. The Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), Securities Investor Protection Corporation (the “SIPC”) and the National Futures Association (“NFA”).
 
Our brokers operate either as independent contractors or employees. An independent contractor registered representative, who becomes an affiliate of a Broker-Dealer Subsidiary, typically establishes his or her own office and is responsible for the payment of expenses associated with the operation of such office, including rent, utilities, furniture, computer and other equipment, market data, software and general office supplies. As a result, the independent contractor registered representative is entitled to retain a higher percentage of the commissions generated by his or her sales than a registered representative employee at a traditional employee-based brokerage firm. This arrangement allows us to operate with a reduced amount of fixed costs and lowers the risk of operational losses for lower production independent contractor registered representatives. A registered representative employee is provided with office space, technology, regulatory support and administrative support in exchange for a lower retention percentage of his or her production.
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, National Asset Management, Inc., a Washington corporation (“NAM”), is a federally-registered investment advisor providing asset management advisory services to retail clients for a fee based upon a percentage of assets managed.
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, National Insurance Corporation, a Washington corporation (“National Insurance”), and Prime Financial Services, a Delaware corporation (“Prime Financial”), provide fixed insurance products to their clients, including life insurance, disability insurance, long-term care insurance and fixed annuities.
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gilman Ciocia, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Gilman”), provides tax preparation services to individuals, predominantly in the middle and upper income tax brackets and accounting services to small and midsize companies.
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, GC Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“GC”), provides licensed mortgage brokerage services in New York and Florida.

Fortress Transaction

Closing of Tender Offer
 
On September 12, 2016, FBIO Acquisition, Inc. (“FBIO Acquisition”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress”), completed its tender offer (the “Offer”) for all outstanding shares of our company at a price of $3.25 per share, net to the seller in cash (less any required withholding taxes and without interest) (the “Offer Price”), pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 27, 2016 (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”) among our company, Fortress and FBIO Acquisition. The Offer expired at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Friday, September 9, 2016. Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the depositary for the Offer, advised Fortress and FBIO Acquisition that, as of the expiration time of the Offer, a total of 7,037,482 shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn (including shares delivered through notices of guaranteed delivery), representing approximately 56.6% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and approximately 51.4% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a fully-diluted basis immediately following the completion of the Offer (in each case, without giving effect to the issuance or exercise of the Dividend Warrants as further described below under the heading “Warrant Dividend”).
 
On September 12, 2016, FBIO Acquisition accepted for payment all shares that were validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration time of the Offer (such time of acceptance, the “Acceptance Time”) and delivered payment for such shares. The aggregate consideration paid by FBIO Acquisition in the Offer was approximately $22,872,000, without giving effect to related transaction fees and expenses. Fortress funded the payment with cash on hand.
 
In accordance to the Merger Agreement, since less than 80% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock were tendered, we remain a publicly-traded company.
 
Stockholders Rights Agreement
 
In connection with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, we entered into a Stockholders Rights Agreement with FBIO Acquisition (the “Stockholder Rights Agreement”). The Stockholder Rights Agreement, which became effective September 12, 2016, provides FBIO Acquisition with certain director nomination rights with respect to our Board. Specifically, commencing with our 2016 annual meeting of our stockholders, and continuing through September 12, 2019, for so long as FBIO Acquisition holds any shares of our common stock, FBIO Acquisition will have the right to designate for nomination by our Board (or the relevant committee thereof) all directors to be elected at any annual or special meeting of our stockholders. As a result of the rights granted to FBIO Acquisition under the Stockholder Rights Agreement, FBIO Acquisition will be able to control the composition of our Board, and thereby will be able to significantly influence our corporate actions.
 
The Stockholder Rights Agreement also provides that if FBIO Acquisition and its affiliates own at least 35% of all then outstanding shares of our common stock, FBIO Acquisition and its affiliates will be prohibited for a certain period of time from initiating or proposing certain actions with respect to our company, including: (i) until the earlier of September 12, 2019 and the date that FBIO Acquisition and its affiliates own less than 20% of all then outstanding shares of our common stock, certain going-private transactions; (ii) until the earlier of September 12, 2017 and the date that FBIO Acquisition and its affiliates own less than 20% of all then outstanding shares of our common stock, certain business combinations; and (iii) until the earlier of September 12, 2019 and the date that FBIO Acquisition and its affiliates own less than 20% of all then outstanding shares of our common stock, reverse stock-splits with respect to our common stock of a ratio greater than or equal to 100 to one.
 
Dividend Warrants
 
In the Merger Agreement, we agreed to set a record date within ninety days following the Acceptance Time with respect to the distribution to our stockholders of warrants to purchase one share of our common stock for every share of our common stock owned at an exercise price of $3.25 per share (the “Dividend Warrants”). We announced on October 26, 2016 that we had established December 9, 2016 as the record date with respect to the Dividend Warrants.
 
The warrants and the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants, have been registered on a registration statement that was filed with the SEC and was declared effective January 13, 2017. The Company established January 18, 2017 as the distribution date of a dividend of warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock and the warrants began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “NHLDW” on that date.

Reverse Stock Split
 
In February 2015, the Board declared a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of our common stock. All share and per share information contained in this report give effect to the reverse stock split.
Recent Developments 
 
Board of Director Changes
 
Effective April 11, 2017, Michael T. Eustace resigned from the Board of Directors of the Company and on May 16, 2017, the Board appointed Michael E. Singer to the Board.
Officer Changes
 
On January 3, 2017, Michael Mullen was appointed as Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Effective January 31, 2017, the other Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Robert B. Fagenson resigned from his position as Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Mr. Mullen assumed the position of sole Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Fagenson continues to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company and as the Vice Chairman of the Board.
Clearing Relationships
 
The Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries have clearing arrangements with National Financial Services LLC (“NFS”), COR Clearing LLC (“COR”), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Financial Services, LLC (“ICBC”), Rosenthal Collins Group, LLC (“Rosenthal”), R.J. O’Brien & Associates, LLC (“RJO”), Gain Capital Group, LLC (“GCG”) and Archer Daniels Midland Investor Services, Inc. (“ADM”).
Financial Information about Industry Segments
 
We realized approximately 82% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2017 from brokerage services, principal and agency transactions, and investment banking. During fiscal year 2017, brokerage services consisting of retail brokerage commissions represented 51% of total revenues, principal and agency transactions consisting of net dealer inventory gains represented 8% of total revenues, and investment banking, consisting of corporate finance commissions and fees, represented 23% of total revenues. For a more detailed analysis of our results by segment, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 
Brokerage Services
 
 The Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries are each registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and are licensed in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries are also members of FINRA, SIPC, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) and NFA.

Investment executives are given broad discretion to structure their own practices and to specialize in different areas of the securities market subject to supervisory procedures and applicable rules and regulations. In addition, investment executives have direct access to research materials, management, traders, and all levels of support personnel.
 
The brokerage services provided by our registered representatives and investment advisors include execution of purchases and sales of stocks, options, bonds, mutual funds, annuities and various other securities for individual and institutional customers. In fiscal year 2017, stocks and options represented approximately 56% of our business, bonds represented approximately 9% of our business, and mutual funds, annuities and various other securities made up approximately 28% of our business. The percentage of each type of business varies over time as the investment preferences of our customers change based on market conditions.

Typically, our Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries do not recommend particular securities to customers. Rather, recommendations to customers are determined by individual investment executives based upon their own research and analysis, subject to applicable FINRA customer suitability standards. Most investment executives perform fundamental (as opposed to technical) analysis. Solicitations are made by telephone, email, seminars or newsletters.
 
Our Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries generally act as an agent in executing customer orders to buy or sell listed and over-the-counter securities in which we do not make a market, and charge commissions based on the services we provide to our customers. In executing customer orders to buy or sell a security in which we make a market, we may sell to, or purchase from, customers at a price that is substantially equal to the current inter-dealer market price plus or minus a mark-up or mark-down. We may also act as agent and execute a customer’s purchase or sale order with another broker-dealer market-maker at the best inter-dealer market price available and charge a commission. We believe our mark-ups, mark-downs and commissions are competitive based on the services we provide to our customers. The commission charges and mark-ups or mark-downs must be in compliance with guidelines established by FINRA. In order to increase revenues generated from these activities, we continuously seek to hire additional registered representatives and work with our current registered representatives to increase their productivity.
 
Payments to both our independent and employee registered representatives are based on commissions generated and represent a variable cost rather than a fixed cost of operating our business. Commission expense represents a significant majority of our total expenses. We work to control our fixed costs in order to achieve profitability based upon our expectation of market conditions and the related level of revenues. Historically, most of our investment executives served as independent contractors responsible for providing their own office facilities, sales assistants, telephone, Internet, computer and other equipment, software, market data, supplies and other items of overhead. As of September 30, 2017, we had a total of approximately 1,070 associates of which 320 were employees and 750 were independent contractors. Of these associates, approximately 730 were registered representatives. Persons who have entered into independent contractor agreements are not considered employees for purposes of determining our obligations for federal and state withholding, unemployment and social security taxes.
 
Investment executives in the brokerage industry are traditionally compensated on the basis of set percentages of total commissions and mark-ups generated. Most brokerage firms bear substantially all of the costs of maintaining their sales forces, including providing office space, sales assistants, telephone and Internet service, computers and other equipment and supplies. The average commission paid to employee investment executives in the brokerage industry generally ranges from 30% to 50% of total commissions generated.
 
Since we require a majority of our investment executives to absorb their own overhead and expenses, we pay a higher percentage of the net commissions and mark-ups generated by our investment executives, as compared to traditional investment executives in the brokerage industry. This arrangement also reduces fixed costs and lowers the risk of operational losses for lower or non-producing brokers. Our operations include execution of orders, processing of transactions, internal financial controls, supervision and compliance with regulatory and legal requirements.
 
Our business plan includes the growth of our retail and institutional brokerage business, while recognizing the volatility of the financial markets. In response to historical market fluctuations, we have periodically adjusted certain business activities, including proprietary trading and market-making trading. We believe that consolidation within the industry may occur and we may consider strategic acquisitions in the future, but we are focused on generating positive cash flow and maintaining profitability of our current operations.
 
Periodic reviews of controls are conducted and supervision, administrative and operations personnel meet frequently with management to review operating conditions. Compliance, supervision and operations personnel monitor compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.
 
Broker Dealer Trading
 
Our Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries buy and may maintain inventories in equity securities as “market-makers” for sale of those securities to other dealers and to our customers. We may also maintain inventories in corporate, government and municipal debt securities for sale to customers. The level of our market-making trading activities will increase or decrease depending on the relative strength or weakness of the broader markets. As of September 30, 2017, we made markets in approximately 750 micro and small-cap NASDAQ and other exchange-listed and over the counter quoted stocks. We anticipate that we will continue market-making trading activity in the future, which may include securities of companies for which we managed or co-managed a public offering.
 
 4



Our trading departments require a commitment of capital. Most principal transactions place our capital at risk. Profits and losses are dependent upon the skill of the traders, price movements, trading activity and the size of inventories. Since our trading activities occasionally may involve speculative and thinly capitalized stocks, including stabilizing the market for securities which we have underwritten, we impose position limits to reduce our potential for loss.
 
In executing customer orders to buy or sell a security in which we make a market, we may sell to, or purchase from, customers at a price that is substantially equal to the current inter-dealer market price plus or minus a mark-up or mark-down. We may also act as agent and execute a customer’s purchase or sale order with another broker-dealer market-maker at the best inter-dealer market price available and charge a commission. We believe our mark-ups, mark-downs and commissions are competitive based on various factors including the services we provide to our customers.
 
Investment Banking
 
We provide corporate finance and investment banking services, including underwriting the sale of securities to the public in both initial and follow-on offerings and arranging for the private placement of securities with investors. Our investment banking services require a short term commitment of capital. Our corporate finance operations provide a broad range of financial and corporate advisory services, including mergers and acquisitions, project financing, capital structure and specific financing opportunities. Corporate finance revenues are generated from capital raising transactions of equity and debt securities and fees for strategic advisory services. Recognizing the diversity of our clients, we plan to work closely with our independent advisors to identify key additional investment banking verticals that we can strengthen to enhance our offerings to our clients.
 
Among the areas in which we intend to enhance our presence is biotechnology and healthcare. We already have a very successful emerging biotechnology and healthcare investment banking business, which accounted for approximately 52% of all investment banking revenues for the year ended September 30, 2017. Investment banking revenues during the 12 month period ended September 30, 2017, on account of financings conducted by us for Fortress and its affiliated companies, represented approximately 62% of our biotech and healthcare investment banking revenues.
 
On October 26, 2016, we announced that our healthcare related investment banking and research businesses will operate under the name OPN Capital Markets. We believe that with our contacts in the biotech community, we can attract to our company key biotech investment bankers as well as make introductions to biotech companies seeking financing.
 
Investment Advisory Services
 
NAM, a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company and a SEC-registered investment advisor, offers advisory services described below to clients in various programs. Under such customized engagements, clients authorize NAM to purchase and sell securities on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis (depending on the program) pursuant to investment objectives chosen by the client. The client’s Investment Advisory Representative (“IAR”) obtains the essential facts from the client, and assists in determining the appropriate program. The IAR provides ongoing investment advice and management that is tailored to the individual needs of the client through a review of the investment profile and objectives of the client. Depending on the program selected and the client’s profile and objectives, the types of securities that may be purchased or sold include mutual funds, ETFs, equities, options, fixed income securities, structured notes and partnership interests in real estate, oil and gas, as well as management of variable annuity sub-accounts. Clients generally may impose reasonable restrictions on investing in certain securities or groups of securities.

NAM receives compensation from clients through assets under management fees, administrative fees, and in some instances, hourly fees, fixed fees, performance-based fees or carried interest. IARs receive a portion of the fees in accordance with their contract with NAM. A NAM IAR may also be a registered representative with National Securities, a subsidiary of our company and an affiliate of NAM, and therefore can establish and service brokerage accounts for NAM clients.
 
Programs currently offered by NAM include:
 

● | The Portfolio Advisor Program, pursuant to which the client’s IAR manages individual client accounts through various investments on a discretionary basis;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Portfolio Advisor Plus Program, in which the client’s IAR manages individual client accounts through various investments on a discretionary basis, with an alternative pricing structure whereby qualified clients may pay a performance-based fee in addition to an asset-based fee;

● | A program utilizing the FTJ FundChoice Program, in which NAM serves as the advisor for the client on a non-discretionary basis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
NAM operates its programs as directed brokerage subject to most favorable execution of client transactions. NAM does not require a client to utilize any particular broker/custodian and currently has relationships with a number of brokers/custodians that provide brokerage, clearing and custody services to clients in the programs. The choice of which broker/custodian to utilize is determined by the client in consultation with their IAR, and a client enters into a separate contractual relationship with the selected broker/custodian. Based on the client’s selection, all transactions for their accounts are then placed through the selected broker-dealer. NAM clients may pay ticket charges for brokerage services according to the agreement between the client and the selected custodian.
 
Clients may elect to use National Securities as their broker-dealer for certain programs. National Securities maintains a clearing arrangement with NFS to execute transactions at negotiated clearing rates. NSC receives a portion of ticket charges paid by NAM clients for trades executed through National Securities. NAM does not receive any compensation for such brokerage services.
 
 6



NAM may combine multiple orders for shares of the same securities purchased for advisory accounts. NAM then allocates a portion of the shares to participating accounts in a fair and equitable manner. NAM does this to obtain, to the extent possible, the optimal execution for clients. The distribution of the shares purchased is typically pro rata based on size of the orders placed for each account. It is not based on account performance or the amount or structure of management fees. When NAM IARs combine orders, each participating account pays an average price per share for all transactions and pays a proportionate share of all transaction costs. Accounts owned by associated IARs may participate in block trading with client accounts; however, they will receive an allocation only after all client orders are filled.
 
Institutional Services
 
 A critical element of our business strategy is to identify institutional quality investments that offer above market returns. We support that mission by providing institutional investment managers, primarily hedge fund managers, a complete array of services designed to enhance portfolio performance. Hedge funds represent a segment of the money management market and by definition are focused on achieving positive returns for their investors while controlling risk. We offer fund managers access to investment opportunities and independent research products. Additionally, we offer fund managers, the ability to reduce their transaction costs by offering them access to our trading desk for illiquid securities and automated trading systems for their liquid transactions as well as special execution services using volume weighted averages and average pricing for micro and small-cap stocks. We believe that our investment executives engaged in institutional services have a mutually beneficial relationship with our Investment Banking Division (“IBD”), as fund managers looking for investment opportunities, participate in IBD’s corporate clients’ issuances. Our relationships with fund managers may create opportunities to increase the number and breadth of IBD clients.Administration, Operations, Securities Transactions Processing and Customer Accounts
 
Our Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries do not hold any funds or securities for customers. Rather, they use the services of clearing agents on a fully-disclosed basis. These clearing agents process securities transactions and maintain customer accounts. In addition to transactions executed through our clearing agents, our Broker Dealer Subsidiaries also conduct direct business. Customer accounts are protected through SIPC for up to $500,000, of which coverage for cash balances is limited to $250,000. In addition to SIPC protection, NFS, our primary clearing agent, provides brokerage accounts additional “excess of SIPC” coverage from Lloyd’s of London, together with other insurers. The “excess of SIPC” coverage would only be used when SIPC coverage is exhausted. Like SIPC protection, “excess of SIPC” protection does not cover investment losses in customer accounts due to market fluctuations. It also does not cover other claims for losses incurred while the firms remain in business. Total aggregate “excess of SIPC” coverage available on all accounts held at National Financial Services is $1.0 billion. Within the “excess of SIPC” coverage, there is no per account dollar limit on coverage of securities, just a per account limit of $1.9 million on coverage of cash.
Tax Preparation and Accounting Services
 
We provide tax preparation and small business accounting services through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gilman. Tax preparation business is conducted predominantly during the period from February through April of each year. During the 2017 tax year season, Gilman prepared approximately 17,000 federal, state and local tax returns.
 
We believe that we offer clients a cost effective and proactive tax preparation and tax planning service. Gilman’s volume allows it to provide uniform services at competitive prices. In addition, as compared to certain of its competitors that are open only during tax season, all of Gilman’s offices are open year round to provide financial planning and other services to our clients.
 
Gilman’s tax preparers are generally not certified public accountants, attorneys or enrolled agents. Therefore, they are limited in the representation that they can provide to clients in the event of an audit by the IRS.

Competition
 
We are engaged in a highly competitive business. With respect to one or more aspects of our business, our competitors include member organizations of the New York Stock Exchange and other registered securities exchanges in the United States and Canada, the U.K., Europe and members of FINRA. Many of these organizations have substantially greater personnel and financial resources and more sales offices than us. Discount brokerage firms affiliated with commercial banks provide additional competition, as well as companies that provide electronic on-line trading. In many instances, our company is also competing directly for customer funds with investment opportunities offered by the real estate, insurance, banking, and savings & loans industries.
 
The securities industry has become considerably more concentrated and more competitive since we were founded, as numerous securities firms have either ceased operations or have been acquired by or merged into other firms. In addition, companies not engaged primarily in the securities business, but with substantial financial resources, have acquired leading securities firms. These developments have increased competition from firms with greater capital resources than ours.
 
Since the adoption of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, commercial banks and thrift institutions have been able to engage in traditional brokerage and investment banking services, thus increasing competition in the securities industry and potentially increasing the rate of consolidation in the securities industry.
 
We also compete with other securities firms for successful sales representatives, securities traders and investment bankers. Competition for qualified employees and independent contractors in the financial services industry is intense. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and independent contractors and to retain and motivate our existing employees and independent contractors. For a further discussion of risks facing our company, please see “Risk Factors.”
 
In addition, our tax preparation business is also subject to extensive competition. We compete with national tax return preparers such as H&R Block, Jackson Hewitt, and Liberty Tax. The remainder of the tax preparation industry is highly fragmented and includes regional tax preparation services, accountants, attorneys, small independently owned companies, and financial service institutions that prepare tax returns as ancillary parts of their business. To a much lesser extent, we compete with the on-line and software self-preparer market.
Government Regulation and Supervision
 
Our Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries and our investment adviser businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the SEC, FINRA, NFA, state securities regulators and other governmental regulatory authorities. The principal purpose of these regulations is the protection of customers and the securities markets. The SEC is the federal agency charged with the administration of the federal securities laws. Much of the regulation of broker-dealers, however, has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA, that adopt rules, subject to approval by the SEC, which govern their members and conduct periodic examinations of member firms’ operations. Securities firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in the states in which they are registered. All of the Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries are registered broker-dealers with the SEC and members of FINRA. They are licensed to conduct activities as a broker-dealer in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 
In addition, as registered broker-dealers and members of FINRA, the Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries are subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1 (the “Net Capital Rule”), which is designed to measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of a broker-dealer and requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. Net capital is defined as the net worth of a broker-dealer subject to certain adjustments. In computing net capital, various adjustments are made to net worth that exclude assets not readily convertible into cash. Additionally, the regulations require that certain assets, such as a broker-dealer’s position in securities, be valued in a conservative manner so as to avoid overstating of the broker-dealer’s net capital.
 
 In February 2015, pursuant to a directive from FINRA, National Securities reverted back to using the alternative method of computing net capital from the aggregate indebtedness method. At September 30, 2017, National Securities had net capital of $9,231,587 which was $8,981,587 in excess of its required minimum net capital of $250,000.

 vFinance Investments is also subject to the Net Capital Rule, which, among other things, requires the maintenance of minimum net capital and requires that the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital, both as defined, shall not exceed 15 to 1. At September 30, 2017, vFinance Investments had net capital of $1,397,346 which was $397,346 in excess of its required minimum net capital of $1,000,000. vFinance Investments’ ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital was .8 to 1.

Each of National Securities and vFinance Investments is exempt from the provisions of the SEC’s Customer Protection Rule 15c3-3 (the “Customer Protection Rule”), since each is an introducing broker-dealer that clears all transactions on a fully disclosed basis and promptly transmits all customer funds and securities to clearing brokers. Calculations of net capital and claimed exemptions are reviewed by an independent audit firm on an annual basis.
 
Our tax preparation business is also subject to extensive regulation. Federal legislation requires income tax return preparers to, among other things, register as a tax preparer, set forth their signatures and identification numbers on all tax returns prepared by them, and retain all tax returns prepared by them for three years. Federal laws also subject income tax preparers to accuracy-related penalties in connection with the preparation of income tax returns. Preparers may be prohibited from further acting as income tax return preparers if they continuously and repeatedly engage in specified misconduct. In addition, authorized IRS e-filer providers are required to comply with certain rules and regulations, as per IRS Publication 1345 and other notices of the IRS applicable to e-filing.
 
IRS regulations require among other things, that all tax return preparers use a Preparer Tax Identification Number (“PTIN”) as their identifying number on federal tax returns filed after December 31, 2010; require all tax return preparers to be authorized to practice before the IRS as a prerequisite to obtaining or renewing a PTIN; causing all previous issued PTIN’s to expire on December 31, 2010 unless properly renewed; allowing the IRS to conduct tax compliance checks on tax return preparers; and defining the individuals who are considered “tax return preparers” for the PTIN applicants. The IRS also conducts background checks on PTIN applicants.
 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related Federal Trade Commission regulations require us to adopt and disclose customer privacy policies.
 
Application of Laws and Rules to Internet Business and Other Online Services
 
Due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services, various regulatory authorities are considering laws and/or regulations with respect to the Internet or other online services covering issues such as user privacy, pricing, content copyrights and quality of services. In addition, the growth and development of the market for online commerce may prompt more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on those companies conducting business online. When the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), which governs the offer and sale of securities, and the Exchange Act, which governs, among other things, the operation of the securities markets and broker-dealers, were enacted, such acts did not contemplate the conduct of a securities business through the Internet and other online services. The recent increase in the number of complaints by online traders could lead to more stringent regulations of online trading firms and their practices by the SEC, FINRA and other regulatory agencies.
 
Although the SEC, in releases and no-action letters, has provided guidance on various issues related to the offer and sale of securities and the conduct of a securities business through the Internet, the application of the laws to the conduct of a securities business through the Internet continues to evolve. Furthermore, the applicability to the Internet and other online services of existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes and personal privacy is uncertain and may take years to resolve. Uncertainty regarding these issues may adversely affect the viability and profitability of our business.
 
As our services through our subsidiaries are available over the Internet in multiple jurisdictions and we have numerous clients residing in these jurisdictions, these jurisdictions may claim that our subsidiaries are required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each such jurisdiction. While the Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries are currently registered as broker-dealers in the jurisdictions described in this Annual Report, all of our subsidiaries are qualified to do business as corporations in only a few international jurisdictions. Failure to qualify as an out-of-state or foreign corporation in a jurisdiction where we are required to do so could subject us to taxes and penalties for the failure to qualify.

None of our personnel are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. Any future increase in the number of employees will depend upon the growth of our business. Our registered representatives are required to take examinations administered by FINRA and state authorities in order to qualify to transact business and are required to enter into agreements with us obligating them, among other things, to adhere to industry rules and regulations, our subsidiaries’ supervisory procedures and not to solicit other employees or brokers in the event of termination.
 
Seasonality and Backlog
 
Other than our tax preparation business, we are not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations, and there are no material backlogs in our business. Because most tax returns are filed during the period from February through April of each year, most revenues from our tax preparation and related services and products will be earned during this period.
Research and Development and Environmental Matters
 
We did not incur any research and development expenses during the last two fiscal years. We do not incur any significant costs or experience any significant effects as a result of compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws.
