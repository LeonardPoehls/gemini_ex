Our Growth Strategy 
 
Our strategy is to introduce our brands to the market through an omni-channel platform that includes, but is not limited to direct response television, digital marketing, live home shopping, traditional retail, e-commerce market places, airlines, and international third-party distributor networks. Our objective is to have our portfolio of products sold through these channels to develop long lasting brands with strong returns on investments.
 
We continually seek to develop, acquire or obtain the license to consumer products that can be distributed and marketed profitably through a distribution network. Success depends, in part, on our ability to market products that appeal to consumers and that can be easily associated with a brand. In order to succeed, we need to identify new products to supplement and possibly replace the existing product lines as they mature through product life cycles.

-


We put forth extensive effort to research and develop new products that are unique and that will be suitable for direct response marketing. The development of new product ideas stems from a variety of sources, including inventors, trade shows, strategic alliances with manufacturing and consumer product companies, industry conferences, and the continuous review of new developments within targeted brand and product categories. In addition, we receive unsolicited new product proposals from independent parties.
 
We also internally generate ideas for new products that we wish to develop. If we have an idea for a product, we will present prototype specifications to one of our manufacturers to develop a prototype, and we will then evaluate the feasibility of selling the product through direct marketing initiatives.
 
When we evaluate a product for its suitability for direct sale, its uniqueness, ability to be demonstrated and consumer’s perception of value are considered. Part of the selection criteria for new products are as follows:
 

● | Products must be unique, demonstrable, have mass-market appeal and generally be unavailable elsewhere in the marketplace. Benefits must be capable of being demonstrated visually, preferably with support from customer testimonials; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Must support a sufficient media cost per order allowable while still representing good perceived value to the consumer; 
● | Must have a unique “hook” to be able to catch the attention of the consumer - the bigger the problem solved by the product, the greater the sales potential; 
● | Easily and effectively promoted through sustained direct sale channels, specifically digital; 
● | Supports a margin sufficiently high enough to maintain profitability when sold through conventional retailers; 
● | Has high volume sales potential, to ensure live home shopping and retailer/e-commerce interest; 
● | Exhibits potential for “back-end” sales either through live home shopping, traditional retail or continuity programs; and 
● | Should have the capability to be marketed internationally through wholesale distributor network. 

Brand Portfolio
 
The following is a list of brands in the ICTV portfolio through ownership or licensing agreement.
 
DermaWand® 
 
Since 1998, we owned the exclusive rights to sell the DermaWand®, an at-home, skin care device that reduces fine lines and wrinkles and improves overall skin appearance. Backed by clinically proven results that have been published in accredited journals, millions have been sold around the world. Targeting the older female demographic, DermaWand® uses radio frequency technology, the same technology used in medspas and doctor’s offices but at a lower amplitude. The combination of thermal energy, instant stimulation and oxygenation show visible improvement in the skin including reduced fine lines and wrinkles, toned and tightened skin and reduced pore size.
 
In January 2016, we acquired the worldwide ownership of the DermaWand® patent and all related trademarks. The price consumers pay for DermaWand® varies from country to country, however, it generally ranges from $90-$150 while sales to third party distributors are made at a wholesale price. The DermaWand® is sold and marketed with DermaVital® skin care products, which are offered with various continuity programs. We plan to release the next generation DermaWand® model in the second quarter of 2018. This second generation DermaWand® will be branded as the DermaWand® Pro Development.

DermaVital®
 
DermaVital® is a brand of cosmetics with a wide variety of skin care products that complement the DermaWand®. The product line consists of several moisturizers that allow water to penetrate the skin’s surface, thus re-hydrating the deeper layers. In addition to moisturizers, the DermaVital® line has facial cleansers, microdermabrasion treatments, eye cream, lip cream, and hand cream.
 
DermaVital® has been offered to DermaWand® buyers through Canada and U.S direct response television (“DRTV”) and digital distribution channels through an auto shipment program. Customers that enrolled can cancel at any time.
 
no!no!® 
 
On January 23, 2017, we acquired the no!no!® brand, which includes an array of hair removal and skin care devices with proven technology that is portable, can be used at home and targets a broad demographic that includes anyone with unwanted hair.
 
The no!no!® hair removal products treat and remove the hair by using Thermicon® technology, which was developed on the basic principle of sending heat signals to the hair. When used consistently over time, Thermicon® can reduce the regrowth of hair. Additionally, unlike other hair removing technologies, no!no!® Thermicon® works on all hair color and skin tones. The no!no!® hair removal line includes a few options that vary in size and power including the Micro, Pro, Ultra, and yet to be released is the no!no!® Pivot, the most powerful and agile version to date, complete with a pivoting head to target hard to reach curves and 2 additional intensity levels.
 
Also, under the no!no!® brand, is the no!no!® Skin device which uses light and heat, the same technology available in dermatologist’s offices, to calm inflammation and kill bacteria in the pore to fight acne. With two ten-second treatments in the morning and evening up to 81% of consumers saw clearance of acne within 24 hours. no!no!® has a FDA 510(k) clearance with the U.S. Food and Drug administration (FDA).
 
In addition to the devices, the no!no!® brand includes an array of consumable skin care products under the name no!no!® Smooth, which are developed to work with the devices to improve the treated skin.
 
Kyrobak®
 
On January 23, 2017, we acquired Kyrobak® which was developed to relieve back pain, using continuous passive motion (CPM) to increase mobility and improve wellness from the comfort of your home. CPM technology is a standard treatment in sports health and rehabilitation clinics around the world. Kyrobak® is designed to move your spine in the same range of motion you would experience when walking at a steady pace. CPM technology brings motion to your spine allowing the vertebrae to open up and decompress. The key demographics for this brand are older men and women.
Cleartouch®
 
On January 23, 2017, we acquired ClearTouch® which provides FDA cleared technology resulting in a no mess option to help with nail fungus. This product is safe, clean and is backed by customer testimonials that have seen impressive results with only two treatments a day that last only 10 seconds each by emitting heat and light to the affected area. Sized no larger than a cell phone and weighing only 3.4 ounces, ClearTouch® can be easily stowed for travel and targets men and women who suffer from nail fungus.
 
On March 6, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries, ICTV Brands UK, ICTV Brands HK and ICTV Brands Israel, entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”), with Therma Bright Inc., a British Columbia corporation (“Therma Bright”), pursuant to which Therma Bright agreed to acquire certain assets relating to the Company’s ClearTouch nail phototherapy device and no!no!® skin phototherapy device, excluding, with some exception, any liabilities relating thereto, and excluding any rights to the trademark or name “no!no!® ” or “no!no!® skin, for a purchase price of $2,250,000, subject to certain closing adjustments.

ICTV Brands Strategic Approach 
 
As consumer trends and viewership habits evolve, a successful marketer needs to be adaptive and adjust to the marketplace. To meet this demand, we employ an omni-channel approach to test, launch and develop our brands. This strategy has become key to a brand’s success and allows marketers to meet consumers’ wants and needs no matter their demographic, habits or buying preferences.

As we expand the brands and their distribution channels, the marketing efforts to support them are selected based on the type of product, the key demographic, competitive trends and historical performance across similar products/brands. As each brand differs so does the formulaic approach to the media mix, however we employ one or many of the following to profitably support our Company.
 

● | Digital Advertising – The online world changes daily and with the advancements of targeted advertising based on behavioral habits and demographic, we have shifted our key testing approach from television to digital initiatives. This helps minimize the marketing waste, which leads to smaller but more efficient testing budgets to more pragmatically determine the next steps for a brand. This strategic approach is applied to the launch of new products, sustaining mature products and re-establishing dormant products with the ultimate goal of driving consumers to the brand’s direct site and converting the visitor into a sale. The digital space offers a variety of marketing opportunities that are used to test, expand and grow the brands; however, we focus on the following element of digital marketing: 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Paid Search – Advertising within the sponsored listings of a search engine or partner site by bidding certain keywords allows us to hit the consumer when they are searching for a term related to a brand. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Email Marketing – Utilizing email lists, typically built from past customers, drives sales that start directly from the consumer’s inbox and allows us to customize a message and exclusive offer with direct delivery. 
● | Programmatic – Automated bidding on online inventory based on previous buyer’s data allows for cost efficient expansion that adjusts automatically for unsurpassed efficiencies. 
● | Social Media – With consistent increase in consumer’s social media intake and the demographic details available about the consumer, utilizing the top tiered social media platforms (i.e. Facebook, YouTube) allows us to deliver targeted creative in environments consumers trust to educate, communicate and interact with about the brands. 
● | Remarketing – Following and offering creative to those that have already visited a brand’s site is a necessary layer to our digital advertising approach as it allows to build frequency and convert the visitor to future sales. 
● | Text, Display & Video – ICTV uses a combination of carefully constructed text, imagery and video across a variety of digital initiatives to educate and drive the consumer to act in a way that results in a sale. 


● | Direct Response Television (DRTV) – Reaching a mass audience with a television creative that elicits an action is one of the original pillars of direct response marketing however with the advancements of DVR and online streaming alongside the massive advancements in digital advertising, DRTV has lost some of its market share to other methods. However, DRTV remains a significant source to drive large sale volumes for us. A variety of factors affect what goes into a brand’s DRTV media mix including the product category, target audience, offer/price point, and competitive behavior. We evaluate these elements for each brand to determine if DRTV is the right fit for the product. If a brand is the right fit for DRTV a strategic plan is developed around the following elements; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Length – Different lengths of creative are employed depending on the campaign’s goal. For brands with a direct sale focus, longer lengths (longform), including infomercials and 5-minute creatives are used. We more often employ this type of length as it provides ample time to educate the consumer to a point of direct purchase for a product with a higher price point, more typical of the ICTV portfolio. Shorter lengths (short form), including any creative shorter than 2 minutes, are typically employed for brands with lower price points or for branding and drive to retail initiatives. ICTV utilizes these lengths however more sparingly. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Geography – DRTV media is offered on a national level and local level. As we typically do not have any geographic restrictions and can deliver our products nationwide, all media options are viable. Our DRTV strategic approach involves a combination of national and local media. 
● | Media Type/Station – With thousands of channels and television programs to choose from, we select the appropriate media type (such as national cable, local broadcast, syndication, and network) and station combination based on the target demographic, cost structure, historical performance, competitive presence and available time. 


9
-


● | Continuity – One of the key factors in selecting brands for our portfolio is the presence of consumables that could be packaged for a continuity program, in which the items are automatically charged and shipped to the consumer based on a predetermined usage schedule. This continuous automatic flow of sale allows us to invest more into converting the initial sale with the expectation of future revenue without additional investment. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Cross Selling – Our portfolio consists of a myriad of products that provide solutions to different consumer problems; however, the target demographics of the brands largely overlap, creating an opportunity to cross sell. We build strong order flows that take the consumer through a variety of upsells and down sells across brands to build the final sales total. Whether on the initial inbound sales call, outbound sales call, inbound customer service call or online via the order flows at the direct sites and through email blasts across customer lists, cross selling is an essential part of the ICTV strategy that is employed across every brand in the portfolio. 
● | Retail/E-Commerce Sales - To capitalize on the brand and product awareness created through the direct sale media support, we move logically to the traditional retail stores and online ecommerce retailers transitioning from the direct response audience to the retail audience. Brand marketers must invest significantly in marketing costs to introduce a new brand. However, we leverage the direct sale media and the product/brand awareness incurred, to cost efficiently, enter and support the retail environment. 
● | Live Home Shopping – Our portfolio of demonstrable products makes them ideal for live home shopping opportunities. Live home shopping networks such as QVC, the Home Shopping Network (HSN) and The Shopping Channel Canada (TSC), have a very large and loyal consumer base providing the brands an opportunity to demonstrate the product live, offer an exclusive deal and grow brand awareness profitably. 
● | International Third-Party Distributors – We distribute product by either selling direct in a country or partnering with a third-party distributor who purchases the products at wholesale pricing and sells it at an agreed upon region/country exclusively. Partnering with these distributors allows us to quickly and cost efficiently enter a market and tailor the brand by region without the cost and risk of setting up a direct selling platform. We work with these distributors to geographically expand the brands in their portfolio as well as add new brands to their portfolio by licensing products from their portfolios to sell in the regions where we have direct sale capabilities. 
● | Print – Direct mail, inserts and print media are employed to extend a brand’s message, target specific geographic locations, increase brand awareness and/or drive direct sale. This type of media tends to resonate with an older demographic which overlaps into many of the products in our portfolio. 


● | Airline – Due to the high level of brand awareness globally, we are afforded the opportunity for ICTV to capitalize on multiple sales channels, such as Duty-Free carts on airlines. ICTV sets the price for this activity and sell directly to the airlines, and in turn, they sell directly to consumers through in-flight magazines. Our current airline business includes airlines all over Asia and South-East Asia as well as British Airways and Virgin Atlantic in the UK. These sales channels offers a print advertising element to accrue incremental sales for ICTV Brands. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Regardless of the marketing initiatives, we utilize a flexible methodology to drive a brand from testing to profitable rollout. This methodology is based on a platform of continuous testing, evaluating, retesting and expansion, moving forward only with those initiatives that provide a profitable return. As the marketplace changes, this approach allows us to identify any shifts and adjust to meet the new standards. ICTV continuously looks for new media outlets, creative approaches and 3rd party vendors to cautiously test to keep the brands growing and profitable.
 
Customer Service
 
We seek to provide our customers with quality customer service. We generally offer an unconditional 30-day money back return policy to purchasers of our products. For our products newly acquired on January 23, 2017, Cleartouch, Kyrobak® and no!no!® we currently offer 60-day money back return policy to purchasers of our products. Our policy is to investigate the cause of returns if returns begin to undermine our expectations for a product’s profitability.

Competition
 
We compete directly with several established companies that generate sales from infomercials and direct response television, as well as small independent direct response television producers. Products like ours may be sold in department stores, pharmacies, general merchandise stores, magazines, newspapers, direct mail advertising, catalogs, and over the internet. Many of our major competitors, which include Telebrands Corp. and Guthy-Renker Corp., have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than do we.
 
We expect that we will face additional competition from new market entrants and current competitors as they expand their direct marketing business models. The barriers to entry in the infomercial industry are low, but there are many difficult hurdles for young entrants to overcome for success in the long-term. To be competitive, we believe we must respond promptly and effectively to the challenges of technological change, evolving standards and our competitors’ innovations. We must also source successful products, create brand awareness and utilize good sales pitches for our products. We believe that although we have a limited operating history, we are strategically positioned to compete because of our management’s experience and strong relationships in the industry. In addition, we feel that associating our products with brands and focusing on the traditional retail environment, as we intend to do, will give us a competitive advantage over traditional infomercial companies who fail to capitalize on the consumer awareness they create through their infomercials.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success is dependent, in part, upon our proprietary rights to our primary products. The following consists of a description of our intellectual property rights.
 
Trademarks
 
We have several registered trademarks for DermaWand®, DermaVital®, Jidue®, Good Planet Super Solution® and DermaBrilliance®, and CoralActives® throughout the world. In addition, under our current licensing agreements for all products, all related trademarks are assigned to us. In addition, all registered trademarks for the family of no!no!®, Kyrobak®, Thermicon® and Ermis Labs® have been assigned.
Patents
 
We own the worldwide patent and all related trademarks for DermaWand® and CoralActives®, as is necessary to manufacture, market and distribute DermaWand® and CoralActives®. In addition, under our current licensing agreements for all products, all related patents are assigned to us. In addition, under our current licensing agreements for all products, all related patents are assigned to us. In addition, all registered patents for the family of no!no!®, Kyrobak®, Thermicon® and Ermis Labs® patents have been assigned.
Copyrights
 
We have copyright registrations for all versions of our infomercials.
 
There can be no assurance that our current or future intellectual property rights, if any, will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that any rights granted under our intellectual property will provide competitive advantages to us. In addition, there can be no assurance that claims allowed on any future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our products. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. We intend to enforce our proprietary rights using licensing agreements and, when necessary, litigation. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, trademarks, copyrights and registered designs has value, rapidly changing technology and industry standards make our future success depend primarily on the innovative skills, expertise, and management abilities of our team rather than on patent and trademark protection.

Royalty Agreements
 
In April 2000, we assumed from R.J.M. Ventures Limited and Better Blocks International Limited, through the share and option purchase agreement we signed with The Better Blocks Trust, the obligation to pay royalties on the sales of the DermaWand®. Under a marketing and royalty agreement with the developer of DermaWand®, we were obligated to pay them a royalty at a fixed rate per unit sold. Under a purchase agreement that we entered into on January 22, 2016 with Omega 5 Technologies, Inc., we acquired the DermaWand® patent and all related trademarks for the sum of $1,200,000 paid out as follows: $300,000 per year for calendar years 2016 through 2019, payable in uniform quarterly installments on or before the last day of each calendar quarter. No interest was charged, and we may, in our sole discretion, at any time without permission or penalty pre-pay some or all of the purchase price. Thus, effective January 1, 2016, we are no longer obligated to make royalty payments on sales of DermaWand®.
 
In April 2013, we entered into a licensing agreement with DermaNew, in which we obtained the exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture and distribute DermaBrilliance®, a patented anti-aging, resurfacing and skin polishing system. The agreement contains royalties based on a percentage of net sales.
 
In July 2013, we acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to Elastin-rp® via a licensing agreement with BioActive Skin Technologies. Elastin-rp® is a branded system of cosmetic formulations designed to help improve the elasticity of the skin, thereby diminishing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. The agreement contains royalties based on a percentage of net sales.
 
In March 2014, we entered into a licensing agreement with Ermis Labs, in which we obtained the exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture and distribute their line of CoralActives® acne treatment and skin cleansing products. In January 2017, we acquired the assets of Ermis Labs, which included all the intellectual property associated with the CoralActives® acne treatment system of products, as well as five unique formulas for medicated cleansing bars that treat such conditions as acne, psoriasis, dermatitis, dandruff and fungus. We are required to pay a minimum annual royalty amount of $175,000 on or before December 31 of each year commencing with calendar year ending December 31, 2017 continuing until the total royalty paid to Ermis Labs totals $1,750,000.
 
In July 2014, we entered into an exclusive marketing agreement with Audy Global Enterprises Inc., in which we obtained the exclusive worldwide license to market and distribute the Jidue® Facial Massager Mask and associated products, provided that the license does not include the right to manufacture the product. The agreement contains royalties based on a percentage of net sales.
 
In January 2017, we completed the PhotoMedex acquisition of proprietary products and services that address skin diseases and conditions of pain reduction using home-use devices for various uses.  Under the PhotoMedex Purchase Agreement, we were required to pay to PhotoMedex and its subsidiaries a continuing monthly royalty on net cash (invoiced amount less sales refunds, returns, rebates, allowances and similar items) actually received by us or our affiliates from sales of the consumer products that we acquired from PhotoMedex. Such royalty payments commenced with net cash actually received from and after January 23, 2017 and would continue until the total royalty paid to PhotoMedex and its subsidiaries totaled $4,500,000.
 
On July 12, 2017, we and ICTV Holdings entered into a Termination and Release Agreement with the PHMD Sellers (the “Release Agreement”). Under the terms of the Release Agreement, the PhotoMedex Purchase Agreement is terminated and of no further force and effect, except for certain surviving rights, obligations and covenants described in the Release Agreement. Pursuant to the Release Agreement, each of the Company and ICTV Holdings, on the one hand, and the PHMD Sellers on the other hand, fully release, forever discharge and covenant not to sue any other party, from and with respect to any and all past and present claims arising out of, based upon or relating to the PhotoMedex Purchase Agreement (other than the surviving covenants described in the Release Agreement) or the transactions contemplated thereby. The Release Agreement required that the Company pay to PhotoMedex $2,000,000 on or before July 15, 2017 (the “Payment”), subject to which, neither the Company nor ICTV Holdings shall have any further royalty or other payment obligations under the PhotoMedex Purchase Agreement.
 
On July 15, 2017, to secure the Payment, the Company issued a 30-month secured promissory note (the “Note”), to LeoGroup Private Investment Access, LLC (the “Holder”) in the principal amount of $2,000,000. The Note provides that the Company shall make monthly payments of $100,000 to the Holder for 30 months. The Note is secured by a first priority security interest in all the assets of Company, except the Company’s accounts receivable. The Note contains customary covenants of the Company and customary events of default. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Note, so long as any event of default, as described in the Note, is continuing, without cure, for a period of five (5) business days after written notice from the Holder to the Company or a longer period if set forth in in the notice from Holder or if agreed to by the parties, all obligations of the Company under the Note shall be immediately due and payable, and the Holder may exercise any other remedies available at law or in equity.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
We are subject to regulation by a variety of federal, state and local agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Health Canada, the Canadian Standards Association and the Food and Drug Administration under the FDC Act. The government regulations to which we are subject vary depending on the types of products we manufacture and market. As we begin to market a broader variety of products and services, we may become subject to regulation by additional agencies.
 
We are also subject to the Federal Mail/Telephone Order Rule. Under the Mail/Telephone Order Rule, it is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a seller to solicit any order for the sale of merchandise to be ordered by the buyer through the mail or by telephone unless, at the time of the solicitation, the seller has a reasonable basis to expect that it will be able to ship the ordered merchandise to the buyer within 30 days after the seller’s receipt of a properly completed order from the buyer. If the buyer uses credit to pay for the merchandise, the period within which the seller must ship the merchandise to the buyer is extended to 50 days. Under the Mail/Telephone Order Rule, the seller, among other things, must provide the buyer with any revised shipping date. If the seller is unable to fulfill an order within 30 or 50 days, as the case may be, then the seller must provide the buyer an option either to consent to a delay in shipping or to cancel their order and receive a prompt refund.
