The principal place of business of Two River Bancorp is located at 766 Shrewsbury Avenue, Tinton Falls, New Jersey 07724 and its telephone number is (732) 389-8722. Effective June 28, 2013, the Company changed its name from Community Partners Bancorp to Two River Bancorp.
 
Two River Bancorp serves as a holding company for Two River Community Bank (“Two River” or the “Bank”), a New Jersey state-chartered commercial bank, having a branch network consisting of 15 branches and two loan production offices (“LPOs”) throughout Monmouth, Middlesex, Union and Ocean Counties, New Jersey.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company and its subsidiaries had 147 full-time equivalent employees, of whom 142 were full-time and 9 were part-time. None of the Company's employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Management of the Company and the Bank believe that, in general, their employee relations are good.
Two River Community Bank
 
Two River Community Bank was organized in January 2000 as a New Jersey state-chartered commercial bank to engage in the business of commercial and retail banking. 
 
As a community bank, the Bank offers a wide range of banking services including demand, savings and time deposits and commercial, residential and consumer/installment loans to small and medium-sized businesses, not-for-profit organizations, professionals and individuals primarily in Monmouth, Middlesex, Union and Ocean Counties, New Jersey. 
 
The Bank also offers its customers numerous banking products such as safe deposit boxes, night depository, wire transfers, money orders, automated teller machines, direct deposit, telephone and internet banking and corporate business services. The Company markets to consumers in geographic areas around its branch network not only through existing bricks and mortar, but also with alternative delivery mechanisms and new product development such as online banking, remote deposit capture, mobile banking and telephonic banking. In addition, the Company attracts new customers by making its service through these distribution points convenient. All of the Company’s existing markets are prime targets for expanding the consumer side of its business with full loan and deposit relationships, and the Company has restructured its retail group to accommodate growth.
 
The Bank currently operates 15 banking offices in Monmouth, Middlesex and Union Counties, New Jersey and a corporate headquarters building. 
 
The Bank’s corporate headquarters is located at 766 Shrewsbury Avenue, Tinton Falls, New Jersey, while its principal banking office is located at 1250 Highway 35 South, Middletown, New Jersey. Other banking offices are located in Allaire, Atlantic Highlands, Manasquan, Navesink, Port Monmouth, Freehold, Red Bank, Tinton Falls (2), West Long Branch, New Brunswick, Westfield, Cranford and Fanwood, New Jersey. 
 
The Bank also operates two regional LPOs in Union and Ocean Counties, New Jersey, for the purpose of expanding our presence in these communities.
 
We believe that the Bank’s customers still want to do business and have a relationship with their banker. To accomplish this objective, we emphasize to our employees the importance of delivering exemplary customer service and seeking out opportunities to build further relationships with the Bank’s customers. The Bank’s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to the statutory limits.
Growth Strategy
 
Profitable and sustainable growth is the Company’s primary goal. In order to achieve our goal, our strategic plan centers on the following:
 

● | Aligning resources to support strategy and productivity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase fee and other non-interest income, primarily through mortgage banking and SBA lending;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continued improvement in net interest income through controlled balance sheet growth; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Growth in earnings per share.
--+------------------------------

 
We will also consider the acquisition of a smaller financial institution, should the opportunity arise, as an avenue to achieve our desired growth.
 
Securing deposits to support expansion across our key lines of business remains a priority for us. Technology initiatives will assist us as well.
 
During 2016, we focused on growth in core markets by increasing loan production, increasing fee-based income and improving profitability. The Company grew loans by $59.9 million and achieved record annual net income to common shareholders of $8.6 million.
 
We are focusing on establishing a market presence in the communities between Union and Ocean Counties by adding strategically located new branches and loan production offices. We will accomplish this goal while operating in a safe and sound manner to provide a desirable return to our shareholders.
 
In January 2015, the Company opened a newly constructed full-service branch at 245-249 North Avenue in Cranford, New Jersey and closed and consolidated our store front office located at 104 Walnut Avenue into this new branch location. In June 2015, the Company closed its Elm Street branch in Westfield and consolidated its operations into our South Avenue branch. The closure of both offices was in line with our strategic plans of optimizing the profitability of our branch network.

We have taken the approach of opening low-cost LPOs in contiguous markets, and once a certain level of business is achieved, we will consider replacing these LPOs with a full-service branch at an appropriate location within that market. Currently, we have two active LPOs. 
 
We believe that this strategy continues to build shareholder value and increase revenues and earnings per share by creating a larger base of lending and deposit relationships while achieving economics of scale and other efficiencies. 
 
Our efforts include looking for potential new retail banking offices in markets where we have established lending relationships, as well as exploring opportunities to grow and add other profitable banking-related businesses. We believe that by establishing banking offices and making selective acquisitions in attractive growth markets while providing high level customer service, our core deposits will naturally increase.
 
Our priorities also include the following:
 

● | Organically growing the size of the loan portfolio
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Utilizing technology to attract new customers and lower costs
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhancing our electronic delivery channels
--+-------------------------------------------


● | Reducing costs associated with non-performing assets and other real estate owned
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Advantages
 
Attractive franchise in demographically desirable markets in New Jersey
 
We believe that the Bank has a strong regional presence in Monmouth, Middlesex, Union and Ocean Counties, which consist of densely populated areas with average household incomes above the US national average. The Company currently has 11 branches in Monmouth County, which currently ranks as the fourth highest median household income county in New Jersey.
 
Commercial lending expertise 
 
We believe we have a strong track record of quality commercial loans, highlighted by a niche expertise in our Private Banking Division (medical practitioners and business owners) and SBA lending without any reliance on wholesale loan purchases.
 
Local brand recognition 
 
We believe we have competed effectively by leveraging a steadily growing branch network and a full assortment of banking products to facilitate loan growth in our core locations. 
 
Conservative underwriting parameters utilizing local expertise
 
The majority of our portfolio is secured by New Jersey properties, with average loan-to-value (LTV) at origination of 75% or less, predominantly owner-occupied along with strong cash flow. We believe this local presence allows our loan underwriters to be able to assess loan candidates better than our peers.
 
High touch regional banking service
 
The Bank strives to compete against local and national competition through personalized customer service, operating upon the principle that a locally owned and operated bank dedicated to the needs of the local community can meaningfully outperform large regional banks managed from outside of this region, in terms of outstanding customer care, responsiveness, and commitment to the community.
 
Products and Services 
 
The Bank offers a full range of banking services to our customers. These services include a wide variety of business and consumer lending products as well as corporate services for businesses and professionals. We offer a range of deposit products including checking, savings, money market accounts and certificates of deposit (“CD”). The Bank also participates in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”), a service that enables us to provide our customers with additional FDIC insurance on CD products. Other products and services include remote deposit capture, safe deposit boxes, ACH services, debit and ATM cards, money orders, direct deposit and coin counting. We also offer customers the convenience of a full complement of electronic banking services accessible either through the web, mobile device or telephone. These services allow customers to perform various transactions, such as making mobile check deposits (consumer), monitoring account balances, receiving email alerts, transferring funds (internal and external), sending and receiving person-to-person payments, initiating stop payment requests, reordering checks and paying bills. The Bank continues to invest in technology solutions for its customers and plans to expand and enhance its electronic services.

Lending Activities
 
The Bank engages in a variety of lending activities, which are primarily categorized as either:
 
(i) | commercial;
----+------------


(ii) | commercial real estate; and
-----+----------------------------


(iii) | residential or consumer lending.
------+---------------------------------

 
The strategy is to focus our lending activities on small and medium-sized business customers and retain customers by offering them a wide range of products and personalized service. Commercial and real estate mortgage lending (consisting of commercial real estate, commercial business, construction, residential and other commercial lending, including medical lending and private banking) are currently our main lending focus. Loans are funded primarily from deposits, although we do borrow to fund loan growth or meet deposit outflows.
 
The Bank presently generates virtually all of our loans from borrowers located in the State of New Jersey, with a significant portion in Monmouth, Middlesex, Union and Ocean Counties. Loans are generated through marketing efforts, the Bank’s present base of customers, walk-in customers, referrals, our directors and members of the Bank’s advisory boards. The Bank strives to maintain a high overall credit quality through the establishment of and adherence to prudent lending policies and practices. The Bank has an established written loan policy that has been adopted by the Board of Directors, which is reviewed at least annually. Any loans to members of the Board of Directors or their affiliates must be reviewed and approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors in accordance with the loan policy as well as applicable state and federal banking laws. In accordance with our loan policy, approvals of affiliated transactions are made only by independent board members.
 
In managing the growth and quality of the Bank’s loan portfolio, we have focused on: 
 
(i) | the application of prudent underwriting criteria;
----+--------------------------------------------------


(ii) | the active involvement by senior management and the Bank’s Board of Directors in the loan approval process;
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | the active monitoring of loans to ensure timely repayment and early detection of potential problems; and
------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | a loan review process by an independent loan review firm, which conducts in-depth reviews of portions of the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis and an annual stress test of the commercial real estate portfolio.
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our principal earning assets are loans originated or participated in by the Bank. The risk that certain borrowers will not be able to repay their loans under the existing terms of the loan agreement is inherent in the lending function. Risk elements in a loan portfolio include non-accrual loans (as defined below), past due and restructured loans, potential problem loans, loan concentrations (by industry or geographically) and other real estate owned acquired through foreclosure or a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Because the Bank makes loans to borrowers located in Monmouth, Middlesex, Union and Ocean Counties, New Jersey and elsewhere, each loan or group of loans presents a geographical and credit risk based upon the condition of the local economy. The local economy is influenced by conditions such as housing prices, employment conditions and changes in interest rates.
 
Construction Loans
 
We originate fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans to individuals and builders to finance the construction of residential dwellings. We also originate construction loans for commercial development projects, including shopping centers, medical office space and owner-occupied properties used for businesses. Within these project types, the Bank also offers land development loans. Our construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase which is usually twelve months for residential owner occupied properties and twelve to eighteen months for commercial properties and upwards to 36 months for land development projects, depending on the size and scope of the project. At the end of the commercial or residential construction phase, the loan can either be converted to a permanent loan or paid in full. 
 
Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by a bank approved independent licensed appraiser, appropriate environmental due diligence, a construction cost review, an inspection of the property before disbursement of funds during the stages of the construction process, and pre-qualification from an identified source for the permanent takeout.
 
Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property’s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the building. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or before the maturity of the loan, with a building having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment. If we are forced to foreclose on a building before or at completion due to a default, there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs.

Commercial and Industrial and Commercial Real Estate Loans
 
The Bank originates commercial and industrial loans for business purposes to sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, limited liability companies, and small businesses in our lending market areas. We extend commercial business loans on a secured and unsecured basis. Secured commercial loans are generally collateralized by residential and nonresidential real estate, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, industrial/commercial machinery and equipment, and furniture and fixtures. To further enhance our security position, we typically require personal guarantees of the principal owners of the entities to which we extend credit. These loans are made on both lines of credit and fixed-term basis ranging from one to five years in duration. 
 
When making commercial business loans, we consider the financial statements and/or tax returns of the borrower, the borrower’s payment history along with the principal owners’ payment history, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business, the value of the collateral and the financial strength of the guarantor.
 
Commercial real estate loans are made to local commercial, retail and professional firms and individuals for the acquisition of property or the refinancing of existing property. These loans are typically related to commercial businesses and secured by the underlying real estate used in these businesses or real property of the principals. These loans are generally offered on a fixed or variable rate basis, subject to rate re-adjustments every five years and amortization schedules ranging from 5 to 25 years.
 
Our established written underwriting guidelines for commercial loans are periodically reviewed and enhanced as needed. Pursuant to these guidelines, in granting commercial loans, we look primarily to the borrower’s cash flow as the principal source of loan repayment. To monitor cash flows on income properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors of loan relationships to provide annual financial statements, rent rolls and/or tax returns. Collateral and personal guarantees of the principals of the entities to which we lend are consistent with the requirements of our loan policy.
 
Commercial loans are often larger and may involve greater risks than other types of lending. Because payments of such loans are often dependent on the successful operation of the business involved, repayment of such loans may be more sensitive than other types of loans and are subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market, or the general economy. We are also involved with off-balance sheet financial instruments, which include collateralized commercial and standby letters of credit. We seek to minimize these risks through our underwriting guidelines and prudent risk management techniques. Any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. Environmental surveys and inspections are obtained when circumstances suggest the possible presence of hazardous materials. There can be no assurances, however, of success in the efforts to minimize these risks.
 
Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income and which are secured by real property the value of which tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business operation. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself as the primary source of repayment. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time and may be difficult to appraise as values fluctuate.
 
Residential Real Estate Loans / Mortgage Banking
 
The Company’s mortgage banking activity is primarily related to the origination of one-to-four family residential real estate located within our primary market areas in Monmouth, Middlesex, Union and Ocean Counties of New Jersey. We offer a full range of residential real estate loans. We do not originate subprime or negative amortization loans. Residential real estate loans consist of single-family detached units, individual condominium units, two-to-four family dwelling units and townhouses.
 
We typically retain adjustable-rate mortgage (“ARM”) loans in our portfolio. In recent periods, borrowers have largely trended towards fixed-rate loans as a result of the continuation of the historically low interest rate market. The Company’s fixed-rate mortgage banking activities typically have contractual maturities exceeding fifteen years and beyond. These loans are sold, on a case-by-case basis, in the secondary market as part of the Company’s efforts to manage interest rate risk.
 
 
5



Consumer Loans
 
The Bank offers consumer loans that are extended to individuals for personal or household purposes. These loans consist of home equity lines of credit, home equity loans, personal loans, automobile loans and overdraft protection.
 
Our home equity revolving lines of credit come with a floating interest rate tied to the prime rate. Lines of credit are available to qualified applicants in amounts up to $350,000 for up to 15 years. We also offer fixed rate home equity loans in amounts up to $350,000 for a term of up to 15 years. Credit is based on the income and cash flow of the individual borrowers, properly margined real estate collateral supporting the mortgage debt and past credit history.
 
Consumer loans may entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that are in junior mortgage position. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.
 
Participation Loans
 
The Bank underwrites all loan participations in accordance with our underwriting standards. We will not participate in a loan transaction unless each participant has a substantial interest in the loan relationship. In addition, we also consider the financial strength and reputation of the lead lender. To monitor cash flows on loan participations, we look for the lead lender to provide at a minimum, tax returns and annual financial statements for the borrower. Generally, we also conduct an annual internal loan review for participations.
Small Business Administration (“SBA”) Loans 
 
The Bank offers SBA loans and achieved Preferred Lending status in 2011, which allows us to have delegated authority to approve and close SBA loans up to $5.0 million. Our risk philosophy in SBA lending is an extension of our existing credit culture and focused on the cash flow of the businesses while maintaining our commitment to providing small and mid-sized companies access to the credit they need to expand and hire. The Bank participates in SBA’s 7(a), including 7(a) sub-program such as SBA Express, and 504 loan programs. The 7(a) program typically provides guarantees ranging from 50% to 85%. The 504 program provides fixed rate financing with a first lien position for a conventional loan followed by a SBA debenture loan in a subordinated position. The 504 program is administered through SBA’s Certified Development Companies (“CDCs”). A typical 504 structure transaction is broken down by a 10% equity injection by the borrower, a 40% SBA debenture and a 50% conventional mortgage.
Market Area
 
Our primary market area consists of Monmouth, Middlesex, Union and Ocean Counties, New Jersey. Our customer base is primarily made up of business and personal banking relationships within these market areas.
 
We attract deposit relationships from individuals, merchants, small to medium-sized businesses, not-for-profit organizations and professionals who live and/or work in the communities comprising our market areas. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 51% of our deposits are from businesses and 49% from consumers.
 
Competition
 
The Bank faces substantial competition for deposits and creditworthy borrowers. It competes with New Jersey and regionally based commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations, as well as national financial institutions, many of which have assets, capital and lending limits greater than that of the Bank. Other competitors include money market mutual funds, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, stock brokerage firms, regulated small loan companies, credit unions and issuers of commercial paper and other securities.
 
In all four counties in which we do business, we have significant competition from banks with much larger branch networks nationwide, as well as credit unions and other community banks. 
 
Asset Quality
 
We believe that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. We have sought to grow and diversify the loan portfolio, while maintaining a high level of asset quality and moderate credit risk, using underwriting standards that we believe are conservative along with diligent monitoring. As we continue to grow and leverage our capital, we envision that loans will continue to be our principal earning assets. An inherent risk in lending is the borrower’s ability to repay the loan under its existing terms. Risk elements in a loan portfolio include non-accrual loans (as defined below), past due and restructured loans, potential problem loans, loan concentrations (by industry or geographically) and other real estate owned acquired through foreclosure or a deed in lieu of foreclosure.

Non-performing assets include loans that are not accruing interest (non-accrual loans) as a result of principal or interest being in default for a period of 90 days or more, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing and other real estate owned, which consists of real estate acquired as the result of a defaulted loan. When a loan is classified as non-accrual, interest accruals cease and all past due interest is reversed and charged against current income. Until the loan becomes current as to principal or interest, as applicable, any payments received from the borrower are applied to outstanding principal and fees and costs to the Bank, unless we determine that the financial condition of the borrower and other factors merit recognition of such payments as interest. 
 
A troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) is a loan in which the contractual terms have been modified resulting in the Bank granting a concession to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulties in order for the Bank to have a greater opportunity of collecting the indebtedness from the borrower. Non-accruing TDRs are included in non-performing loans.
 
We utilize a risk system, as described below under the section titled “Allowance for Loan Losses,” as an analytical tool to assess risk and set appropriate reserves. In addition, the FDIC has a classification system for problem loans and other lower quality assets, classifying them as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” A loan is classified as “substandard” when it is inadequately protected by the current value and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Loans with this classification have a well-defined weakness or a weakness that jeopardizes the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that some loss may occur if the deficiencies are not corrected. A loan is classified “doubtful” when it has all the weaknesses inherent in a loan classified as substandard with the added characteristics that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing factors, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. A loan is classified as “loss” when it is considered uncollectible and such little value that the loan’s continuance as an asset on the balance sheet is not warranted.
 
In addition to categories for non-accrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more that are still accruing interest, we maintain a “watch list” of performing loans where management has identified conditions which potentially could cause such loans to be downgraded into higher risk categories in future periods. Loans on this list are subject to heightened scrutiny and more frequent review by management. See Note 1-I in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Non-performing assets are further discussed within the “Asset Quality” section under Item 7 of this report.
 
Allowance for Loan Losses
 
We maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level that we believe is adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Loan losses are charged directly to the allowance when they occur and any recovery is credited to the allowance when realized. Risks from the loan portfolio are analyzed on a continuous basis by the Bank’s senior management, outside independent loan reviewers, the directors’ asset quality loan committee, the Board of Directors and our regulators.
 
The level of the allowance is determined by assigning specific reserves to impaired loans and general reserves on all other loans. The portion of the allowance that is allocated to impaired loans is determined by estimating the inherent loss on each credit after giving consideration to the value of the underlying collateral. A risk system, consisting of multiple grading categories, is utilized as an analytical tool to assess risk and set appropriate general reserves. Along with the risk system, senior management evaluates risk characteristics of the loan portfolio under current and anticipated economic conditions and considers such factors as the financial condition of the borrower, past and expected loss experience, and other factors management feels deserve recognition in establishing an appropriate reserve. These estimates are reviewed at least quarterly, and as adjustments become necessary, they are realized in the periods in which they become known. Additions to the allowance are made by provisions charged to expense and the allowance is reduced by net charge-offs (i.e., loans judged to be uncollectible and charged against the reserve, less any recoveries on such loans).
 
Although management attempts to maintain the allowance at a level deemed adequate to cover any losses, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based upon any changes in market conditions, either generally or specific to our area, or changes in the circumstances of particular borrowers. In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses, and may require us to take additional provisions based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. See Note 1-J in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
 
Risk Management
 
Managing risk is an essential part of a successful financial institution. Our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk, interest rate risk and market risk. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as available for sale securities that are accounted for on a fair value basis. Other risks that we face are operational risks, liquidity risks and reputation risk. Operational risks include risks related to fraud, regulatory compliance, processing errors, and technology and disaster recovery. Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors or borrowers. Reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press, whether true or not, could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue.

 
7



The management of and authority to assume interest rate risk is the responsibility of the Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”), which is comprised of senior management and board members. The primary objective of Asset/Liability management is to establish prudent risk management guidelines and to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain a reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles. We have policies and practices for measuring and reporting interest rate risk exposure, through analysis of the net interest margin, gap position, simulation testing, liquidity ratios and the Economic Value of Portfolio Equity. In addition, we annually review our interest rate risk policy, which includes limits on the impact to earnings from shifts in interest rates.
 
Credit Risk Management
 
Our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well-defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans. The Bank conducts annual commercial real estate stress testing. To further enhance our credit risk management strategy, we engage a third party loan review firm to provide additional portfolio surveillance. When a borrower fails to make a required loan payment, we take a number of steps to attempt to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. When the loan becomes 15 days past due, a late charge notice is generated and sent to the borrower and a representative of the Bank attempts to communicate by phone with the borrower to discuss the late payment. If payment is not then received by the 30th day of delinquency, a further notification is sent to the borrower. If no resolution can be achieved, after a loan becomes 90 days delinquent, we may commence foreclosure or other legal proceedings. If a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or refinanced before the foreclosure sale, the real property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure. We may consider loan workout arrangements with certain borrowers under certain circumstances.
 
Management reports to the Board of Directors monthly regarding the amount of loans delinquent more than 30 days, and all loans in foreclosure and all foreclosed and repossessed property that we own.
 
Investment Portfolio
 
Our investment portfolio consists primarily of obligations of U.S. Government sponsored agencies as well as municipal and government authority bonds, with corporate bonds accounting for less than 10% of the portfolio. Government regulations limit the type and quality of instruments in which the Company may invest its funds.
 
We conduct our asset/liability management through consultation with members of our Board of Directors, senior management and an outside financial advisor. The ALCO, which is comprised of the president, senior officers and certain members of our Board of Directors, is responsible for the review of interest rate risk and evaluates future liquidity needs over various time periods.
 
We have established a written investment policy which is reviewed annually by the ALCO and our Board of Directors that applies to Two River Bancorp and the Bank. The investment policy identifies investment criteria and states specific objectives in terms of risk, interest rate sensitivity and liquidity and emphasizes the quality, term and marketability of the securities acquired for our investment portfolio.
 
The ALCO is responsible for monitoring the investment portfolio and ensuring that investments comply with the investment policy. The ALCO may from time to time consult with investment advisors. The Bank’s president and its chief financial officer may purchase or sell securities in accordance with the guidelines of the ALCO committee. The Board of Directors reviews the composition and performance of the investment portfolio, including all transactions, on a monthly basis.
 
Deposit Products
 
We strive to develop relationships and serve as the primary financial institution for commercial and individual customers. A key priority in this mission is obtaining transaction accounts, which are frequently non-interest bearing deposits or lower cost interest bearing checking, savings and money market deposit accounts.
 
Deposits are the primary source of funds used in lending and other general business purposes. In addition to deposits, we may derive additional funds from principal repayments on loans, the sale of investment securities and borrowings from other financial institutions. Loan amortization payments have historically been a relatively predictable source of funds. The level of deposit liabilities can vary significantly and is influenced by prevailing interest rates, money market conditions, general economic conditions and competition.
 
The Bank’s deposits consist of checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and CDs. All deposits are obtained from individuals, partnerships, corporations and unincorporated businesses. The Bank participates in CDARS, a service that enables us to provide our customers with additional FDIC insurance on CD products. We attempt to control the flow of deposits primarily by pricing our accounts to remain competitive with other financial institutions in our market area.

Supervision and Regulation
 
Overview
 
Two River Bancorp operates within a system of banking laws and regulations intended to protect bank customers and depositors, and these laws and regulations govern the permissible operations and management, activities, reserves, loans and investments of the Company.
 
Two River Bancorp is a bank holding company under the Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (“BHCA”), as amended by the Financial Modernization Act of 1999, known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and is subject to the supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). In general, the BHCA limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks, and performing certain servicing activities for subsidiaries and, as a result of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act amendments, permits bank holding companies that are also financial holding companies to engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of any company engaged in any activity, that is either (1) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or (2) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. In order for a bank holding company to engage in the broader range of activities that are permitted by the BHCA for bank holding companies that are also financial holding companies, upon satisfaction of certain regulatory criteria, the bank holding company must file a declaration with the Federal Reserve Board that it elects to be a “financial holding company.” Two River Bancorp does not presently intend to seek a “financial holding company” designation at this time, and does not believe that the current decision not to seek a financial holding company designation will adversely affect its ability to compete in its chosen markets. We believe that seeking such a designation for Two River Bancorp would not position it to compete more effectively in the offering of products and services currently offered by the Bank. Two River Bancorp is also subject to other federal laws and regulations as well as the corporate laws and regulations of New Jersey, the state of its incorporation.
 
The BHCA prohibits the Company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to subsidiary banks. The BHCA requires prior approval by the Federal Reserve Board of the acquisition by the Company of more than five percent of the voting stock of any other bank. Satisfactory capital ratios, Federal Community Reinvestment Act ratings and anti-money laundering policies are generally prerequisites to obtaining federal regulatory approval to make acquisitions.
 
The Bank is a commercial bank chartered under the laws of the State of New Jersey and is subject to the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948 (the “Banking Act”). As such, it is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and by the FDIC. Each of these agencies regulates aspects of activities conducted by the Bank and Two River Bancorp, as discussed below. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
 
The following descriptions summarize some of the more recent changes to the key laws and regulations to which the Bank is subject, and to which Two River Bancorp is subject as a registered bank holding company. These descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations. Future changes in these laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and application thereof by their administering agencies, cannot be predicted, but could have a material effect on the business and results of Two River Bancorp and the Bank.
 
Small Business Lending Fund
 
On August 11, 2011, the Company received $12 million under the Small Business Lending Fund (“SBLF”), created as part of the Small Business Jobs Act. In exchange for the $12 million, the Company issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) 12,000 shares of its Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C, having a $1,000 liquidation preference per share (the “SBLF Preferred Shares”). The SBLF Preferred Shares qualified as Tier 1 Capital. On December 15, 2014, the Company redeemed $6.0 million (6,000 shares) of the outstanding SBLF Preferred Shares and on December 15, 2015, the remaining $6.0 million (6,000 shares) was redeemed. From July 1, 2013 to their redemption on December 15, 2015, the dividend rate on the SBLF Preferred Shares was 1.00%.
Dividend Restrictions
 
The primary source of cash to pay dividends to the Company’s shareholders and to meet the Company’s obligations is dividends paid to the Company by the Bank. Dividend payments by the Bank to the Company are subject to the laws of the State of New Jersey, the Banking Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”) and the regulation of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and of the Federal Reserve. Under the Banking Act and the FDIA, a bank may not pay any dividends if, after paying such dividends, it would be undercapitalized under applicable capital requirements. In addition to these explicit limitations, the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a banking subsidiary or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices. Depending upon the circumstances, the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice.

It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available from the immediately preceding year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividend that undermines the bank holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiary. A bank holding company may not pay dividends when it is insolvent.
 
In 2016, Two River Bancorp paid $1.2 million in cash dividends to common shareholders.
 
Transactions with Affiliates
 
Banking laws and regulations impose certain restrictions on the ability of bank holding companies to borrow from and engage in other transactions with their subsidiary banks. Generally, these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be secured (at levels of 100% and more) by designated amounts of specified collateral and be limited to (i) 10% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus per non-bank affiliated borrower, and (ii) 20% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus aggregated as to all non-bank affiliated borrowers. In addition, certain transactions with affiliates must be on terms and conditions, including credit standards, at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing for arms-length transactions.
Deposit Insurance
 
All U.S. banks are required to have their deposits insured by the FDIC. The maximum amount of deposit insurance per depositor is $250,000. The FDIC charges premiums or “assessments” to pay for the deposit insurance provided. These assessments are based on the average total assets of a bank minus the bank’s average tangible equity.
 
Deposit insurance assessments have been “risk based,” in that the riskier a bank’s perceived business activities, the higher deposit insurance rate it has to pay. All banks are assigned to one of four “risk categories” by the FDIC, pursuant to their capital levels and examination results. The assignment to a particular risk category is made by the FDIC each quarter based on the most recent information available. Then, the FDIC applies certain adjustments to each bank based on its specific asset attributes to determine a final assessment ratio. As discussed above, these assessments are based on assets, not deposits, and the assessment rates will range from 2.5 basis points to 45 basis points.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the deposit insurance fund to reach a reserve level of 1.35% of all insured deposits by September 2020, and authorizes the FDIC to implement changes in assessment rates in order to achieve such level. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the FDIC to establish a “designated reserve ratio” (which the FDIC has now set at 2.0%), and to reduce or eliminate assessments if the designated reserve ratio is met. If the deposit fund reserve ratio is 2.5% or more, the FDIC is authorized, but not required, to return assessments to banks. Given that most experts believe that the deposit fund will continue to incur losses over the short term for bank failures that have occurred and will occur from the financial crisis, it is expected that all banks will have to pay significant amounts of deposit insurance assessments for the foreseeable future, with little likelihood of reductions in deposit insurance assessments (or return of assessments paid) unless there is a material improvement in the economy and the health of the financial industry.
 
Capital Adequacy
 
The Federal banking regulators have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for banks and bank holding companies. The minimum guideline for the ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is 8%. At least half of the total capital is to be comprised of common stock, retained earnings, minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less goodwill and certain other intangibles (“Tier 1 Capital”). The remainder may consist of other preferred stock, certain other instruments and a portion of the loan loss allowance (“Tier 2 Capital”). “Total Capital” is the sum of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital.
 
In addition, the Federal banking regulators have established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for banks and bank holding companies. These guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to average total assets of 3% for banks that meet certain specified criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating. All other banks and bank holding companies generally are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 3% plus an additional cushion of 100 to 200 basis points. At December 31, 2016, Two River Bancorp’s leverage ratio was 8.94%.
 
The Company’s and the Bank’s capital ratios at December 31, 2016 and 2015 are set forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Capital Resource.” Both the Company and the Bank were “well-capitalized” at December 31, 2016.
 
Basel III Capital Rules. Effective on January 1, 2015, the federal bank regulatory agencies revised their capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules to enhance such requirements and implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly referred to as Basel III. 
 
 
10



The rules generally implement higher minimum capital requirements, add a new common equity Tier 1 Capital requirement, and establish criteria that instruments must meet to be considered common equity Tier 1 Capital, additional Tier 1 Capital or Tier 2 Capital. The new minimum capital to risk-adjusted assets requirements are a common equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of 4.5% (6.5% to be considered “well capitalized”) and a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6.0%, increased from 4.0% (and increased from 6.0% to 8.0% to be considered “well capitalized”); the total capital ratio remains at 8.0% under the new rules (10.0% to be considered “well capitalized”).
 
Under the new rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity Tier 1 Capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets. The capital conservation buffer requirements phase in over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2016.
 
Under these new requirements, as of December 31, 2016, the Company and the Bank are well-capitalized and each of them has a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5%.
 
Prompt Corrective Action
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) requires federal banking regulators to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Failure to meet minimum requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on Two River Bancorp’s financial condition. Under the FDIA’s Prompt Corrective Action Regulations, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
 
The Prompt Corrective Action Regulations define specific capital categories based on an institution’s capital ratios. The capital categories, in declining order, are “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized.” The FDIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the capital category by which the institution is classified. Institutions categorized as “undercapitalized” or worse may be subject to requirements to file a capital plan with their primary federal regulator, prohibitions on the payment of dividends and management fees, restrictions on asset growth and executive compensation, and increased supervisory monitoring, among other things. Other restrictions may be imposed on the institution by the regulatory agencies, including requirements to raise additional capital, sell assets or sell the entire institution. Once an institution becomes “critically undercapitalized,” it generally must be placed in receivership or conservatorship within 90 days.
 
The appropriate federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances, reclassify a well-capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized. The appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category (but not to treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) based on supervisory information other than an institution’s capital levels.
 
Unsafe and Unsound Practices
 
Notwithstanding its Prompt Corrective Action Regulations category dictated by risk-based capital ratios, the FDIA permits the appropriate bank regulatory agency to reclassify an institution if it determines, after notice and a hearing, that the condition of the institution is unsafe or unsound, or if it deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. Also, if a federal regulatory agency with jurisdiction over a depository institution believes that the depository institution will engage, is engaging, or has engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice, the regulator may require that the bank cease and desist from such practice, following notice and a hearing on the matter.
 
The USA PATRIOT Act
 
The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 is a comprehensive anti-terrorism law. Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act imposes significant anti-money-laundering compliance and due diligence obligations on financial institutions, imposes crimes and penalties and expands the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The Treasury has issued a number of implementing regulations which apply various requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act to financial institutions such as the Bank. Those regulations impose new obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing.
 
Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act’s requirements could have serious legal consequences for the institution and adversely affect its reputation. Two River Bancorp and the Bank adopted policies, procedures and controls designed to address compliance with the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act under the existing regulations and will continue to revise and update its policies, procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the USA PATRIOT Act and by Treasury regulations.

Community Reinvestment Act
 
The Federal Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires banks to respond to the full range of credit and banking needs within their communities, including the needs of low and moderate-income individuals and areas. A bank’s failure to address the credit and banking needs of all socio-economic levels within its markets may result in restrictions on growth and expansion opportunities for the bank, including restrictions on new branch openings, relocation, formation of subsidiaries, mergers and acquisitions. Upon completion of a CRA examination, an overall CRA rating is assigned using a four-tiered rating system. These ratings are: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, and Substantial Noncompliance.
 
In the latest CRA performance evaluation examination report with respect to the Bank, dated October 26, 2015, the Bank received a rating of Outstanding.
 
Consumer Privacy
 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act’s financial privacy provisions generally prohibit financial institutions, including Two River Bancorp and the Bank, from disclosing or sharing nonpublic personal financial information to third parties for marketing or other purposes not related to transactions, unless customers have an opportunity to “opt out” of authorizing such disclosure, and have not elected to do so. It has never been the policy of Two River Bancorp or the Bank, to release such information except as may be required by law.
Loans to One Borrower
 
Federal banking laws limit the amount a bank may lend to a single borrower to 15% of the bank’s capital base, unless the entire amount of the loan is secured by adequate amounts of readily marketable collateral. However, no loan to one borrower may exceed 25% of a bank’s statutory capital, notwithstanding collateral pledged to secure it.
 
New Jersey banking law limits the total loans and extensions of credit by a bank to one borrower at one time to 15% of the capital funds of the bank when the loan is fully secured by collateral having a market value at least equal to the amount of the loans and extensions of credit. Such loans and extensions of credit are limited to 10% of the capital funds of the bank when the total loans and extensions of credit by a bank to one borrower at one time are fully secured by readily available marketable collateral having a market value (as determined by reliable and continuously available price quotations) at least equal to the amount of funds outstanding. This 10% limitation is separate from and in addition to the 15% limitation noted in the first paragraph. If a bank’s lending limit is less than $500,000, the bank may nevertheless have total loans and extensions of credit outstanding to one borrower at one time not to exceed $500,000. At December 31, 2016, the Bank’s lending limit to one borrower was $15.3 million.
 
Dodd-Frank Act
 
The Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in July 2010, significantly restructured financial regulation in the United States.
 
However the implications of the Dodd-Frank Act for the Company’s businesses will depend to a large extent on the manner in which rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act are implemented by the primary U.S. financial regulatory agencies, as well as potential changes in market practices and structures in response to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and financial reforms in other jurisdictions. Among other things:
 

● | The Dodd-Frank Act repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on the Company’s interest expense but, to date, it has not.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), and giving it responsibility for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The “Durbin Amendment” provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act provided that debit card interchange fees must be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction. In June 2011, the Federal Reserve adopted regulations setting the maximum permissible interchange fee as the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction, with an additional adjustment of up to one cent per transaction if the issuer implements certain fraud-prevention standards.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | The Dodd-Frank Act created a new systemic risk oversight body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”), to oversee and coordinate the efforts of the primary U.S. financial regulatory agencies in establishing regulations to address financial stability concerns.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions permitting national and insured state banks to engage in de novo interstate branching if, under the laws of the state where the new branch is to be established, as state bank chartered in that state would be permitted to establish a branch.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Dodd-Frank Act requires various U.S. financial regulatory agencies to implement comprehensive rules governing the supervision, structure, trading and regulation of swap and over-the-counter derivative markets and participants.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal financial regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds), with implementation starting as early as July 2012. The statutory provision is commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule.” We do not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will have a material effect on our operations, although adjustments to the rule will undoubtedly be made.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Executive Compensation
 
The Dodd-Frank Act provides for a say on pay for shareholders of all public companies. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, each company must give its shareholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation of its executives at least once every three years. The Dodd-Frank Act also adds disclosure and voting requirements for golden parachute compensation that is payable to named executive officers in connection with sale transactions.
 
On August 5, 2015, SEC adopted final rules to implement Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, requiring disclosure of the ratio of the CEO’s compensation to that of their median employee (“pay ratio”). An issuer’s first reporting period is its first full year commencing on or after January 1, 2017 (e.g., companies whose fiscal year ends on December 31 will report in proxy statements and 10-Ks filed starting in 2018). The rule is not applicable to “smaller reporting companies,” as defined under SEC rules. Two River Bancorp presently is a “smaller reporting company.”
 
On April 29, 2015, the SEC proposed rules to implement Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act obligating companies to disclose in proxy materials for annual meetings of shareholders information that shows the relationship between executive compensation actually paid to their named executive officers and their financial performance, taking into account any change in the value of the shares of a company’s stock and dividends or distributions. The timing of the final rule making and implementation has not yet been announced.
 
On July 1, 2015, the SEC adopted proposed rules to implement Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act, directing national securities exchanges (like NYSE and Nasdaq) to establish listing standards requiring companies to adopt policies that require executive officers to pay back incentive-based compensation that they were erroneously awarded. The failure by any company to adopt, disclose and implement such a policy would result in a delisting of its securities by such exchanges. The required policy would provide that, in the event the company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the company will recover from any current or former executive officer of the company who received incentive-based compensation during the three-year period preceding the date on which the company is required to prepare the restatement based on the erroneous data, any exceptional compensation above what would have been paid under the restatement. The comment period for the proposed rule ended September 14, 2015, and the SEC has not taken any further action to finalize rules for the exchanges. However, companies must comply with the rule within 60 days of the final rule making.
 
Corporate Governance
 
On February 9, 2015, the SEC adopted proposed rules to implement Section 955 of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring that each company disclose in the proxy materials for its annual meetings whether an employee or board member is permitted to purchase financial instruments designed to hedge or offset decreases in the market value of equity securities granted as compensation or otherwise held by the employee or board member. The timing of the final rule making and implementation has not yet been announced.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act clarifies that the SEC may, but is not required to, promulgate rules that would require that a company’s proxy materials include a nominee for the board of directors submitted by a shareholder. Although the SEC promulgated rules to accomplish this, these rules were invalidated by a federal appeals court decision. The SEC has said that they will not challenge the ruling, but has not ruled out the possibility that new rules could be proposed.

The Dodd-Frank Act requires stock exchanges to have rules prohibiting their members from voting securities that they do not beneficially own (unless they have received voting instructions from the beneficial owner) with respect to the election of a member of the board of directors (other than an uncontested election of directors of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940), executive compensation or any other significant matter, as determined by the SEC by rule.
 
FDIC Matters and Resolution Planning
 
The Dodd-Frank Act created an orderly liquidation process that the FDIC can employ for failing financial companies that are not insured depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the FDIC new authority to create a widely available emergency financial stabilization program to guarantee the obligations of solvent depository institutions and their holding companies and affiliates during times of severe economic stress. Additionally, Dodd-Frank also codifies many of the temporary changes that had already been implemented, such as permanently increasing the amount of deposit insurance to $250,000.
 
New laws or regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations (including changes in interpretation or enforcement) could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to further rulemaking and interpretation, and will take effect over several years. The overall financial impact on the Company and its subsidiaries or the financial services industry generally cannot be anticipated at this time.
 
Overall Impact of New Legislation and Regulations
 
Various legislative initiatives are from time to time introduced in Congress and in the New Jersey State Legislature. It cannot be predicted whether or to what extent the business and condition of Two River Bancorp or the Bank will be affected by new legislation or regulations, and legislation or regulations as yet to be proposed or enacted. Given that the financial industry remains under stress and severe scrutiny, and given that the U.S. economy has not yet fully recovered to pre-crisis levels of activity, we fully suspect that there will be significant legislation and regulatory actions that will materially affect the banking industry generally and our bank specifically for the foreseeable future.
