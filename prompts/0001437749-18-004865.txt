Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
 
We are a fiber broadband and managed IT services provider, offering technology and service enabled customer solutions to business and wholesale customers in and out of Alaska. We also provide telecommunication services to consumers in the most populated communities throughout the state. Our facilities based communications network extends through the economically significant portions of Alaska and connects to the contiguous states via our two diverse undersea fiber optic cable systems. Our network is among the most expansive in Alaska and forms the foundation of service to our customers. We operate in a largely two-player terrestrial wireline market and we estimate our market share to be less than 25% statewide. However, our revenue performance relative to our largest competitor suggests that we are gaining market share in the markets we are serving. Our primary focus is to: (i) generate industry leading revenue growth through increasing broadband and managed IT service revenue with our business, wholesale and consumer customers, (ii) continuously improve our customer service, (iii) improve Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow (both as defined in “Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”) performance through top line growth and margin management, (iv) work with state and federal regulatory agencies to provide a stable and predictable regulatory environment for our business, and (v) consider strategic opportunities that allow us to address risks relative to our scale and geographic concentration.. 
 
The sale of our wireless operations in 2015 (the “Wireless Sale”) included the sale of both our one-third interest in the Alaska Wireless Network (“AWN”) and our wireless customer contracts, but excluded our wifi-based services and the wireless backhaul contracts (which provide wireline broadband services to cellular towers) that we entered into after the formation of AWN. 
 
Our parent company, Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc., was incorporated in 1998 under the laws of the state of Delaware.
