Additionally, we plan to utilize this website to educate and inform users so that they can fully understand the functionality and various features of our App. This website will also be critical to our pursuit of various online marketing campaigns which may include, but not strictly be limited to, social media campaigns and internet advertisement. However, at this point in time our online marketing activities have not been fully defined or established.
