Item 1.  Business
Background
 
Entia Biosciences, Inc. (“Entia”) develops patented, pharmaceutical-grade compounds, including a foundational compound called ErgoD2®.  We believe that ErgoD2 improves iron homeostasis and mitigates iron-related disorders presenting in anemia, chronic kidney disease and select neurodegenerative diseases.  Our goal is to clinically validate and commercialize ErgoD2 through the OTC supplement channels and possibly others, such as medical foods.  We also develop and market health-related nutraceuticals and manufacture certain cosmeceuticals.
 
We have licensed a patent that gives us the exclusive worldwide rights to certain methods for identifying and obtaining compounds, such as ErgoD2, capable of modulating the genetic transporter for L-ergothioneine (“Ergo”).  Ergo is a powerful amino acid that is essential to life. Ergo cannot be synthesized by mammals but is acquired exclusively from the diet and, most importantly, must be delivered by this unique and specific ergothioneine transporter (human gene symbol SLC22A4) to cells throughout the body.  We have also licensed the exclusive rights to UV light enrichment technology for ergocalciferol, the food-based version of vitamin D2.  Vitamin D deficiency, has been linked to a variety of serious medical conditions.  We believe that both our licensed patents and patents pending, along with several other elements of our intellectual property portfolio that address a variety of diseases, give us a competitive advantage in the use of ErgoD2 as a dietary supplement, a nutraceutical and/or a cosmeceutical.
 
Since 2011, we have been conducting pre-clinical and clinical pilot studies evaluating proprietary compounds, such as ErgoD2, that contain elevated concentrations of these two nutrients and other important co-factors found in mushrooms.  These and other research studies have confirmed significant transporter activity in anemia/diabetes, arthritis, alopecia areata (hair loss) and other serious non-communicable chronic conditions.  These studies have also revealed significant observable improvements in symptoms and disease-associated biomarkers in patients with anemia/diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, and chronic kidney disease.  We have also conducted several immunohistochemistry (“IHC”) studies that have confirmed significant ergothioneine transporter ("ETT") activity at the sites of rapidly dividing cells (macrophages and stem cells), suggesting that Ergo is genetically required to prevent/repair damage from free radicals and oxidative stress as well as to support the production/maintenance of healthy cells.  All of these results suggest an important physiologic role for Ergo in chronic diseases, particularly iron-related disorders and auto-immune conditions that afflict millions of people worldwide. 
 
We have filed patent applications on the use of ErgoD2 for several therapeutic and non-therapeutic uses and have commenced or will commence follow-on studies to confirm our positive initial clinical results in larger patient populations, with the objective of releasing our branded products for the treatment of a variety of afflictions.  We anticipate these afflictions to include chronic kidney disease, autism, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, to name a few.   We plan to explore other important potential therapies as our funding allows. 
 
 OTC-strength versions of these formulations and other consumer-oriented products for the general wellness and beauty markets have been offered by us online and through a limited number of resellers.  In February of 2017, we entered a licensing agreement with an established beauty industry company, which plans on operating by the name “GROH Beauty Corp,” and under which license we granted certain exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture and distribute GROH beauty products.  The License calls for a front-end license fee and royalties over a period of years, until the license is paid in full and thereby becomes an exclusive perpetual license of the GROH Beauty Corp.  The License calls for and was accompanied by a separately executed agreement under which we are to manufacture and sell our ErgoD2 compound exclusively to the GROH Beauty Corp for its use in the cosmetic and beauty care markets.  As this manufacturing agreement provides for price adjustments and is expected to run for a number of future years concurrent with the license, its positive value to us is inestimable at this time.  Additionally, the License calls for a separate agreement with us through which our Chief Science and Technology Officer will provide limited consulting services to the Licensee.
 
Our Business
 
 ErgoD2 is a proprietary pharmaceutical-grade compound created from whole foods that contain the micro-nutrients L-ergothioneine, an amino acid that responds to a dedicated transporter (SLC22A4) that is present in every human, and vitamin D2 that has been naturally enriched using our licensed, patented technology.  These genetically-required nutrients have been implicated by independent scientists in metabolic iron regulation and intracellular iron chelation/transportation, indicating their therapeutic potential.  We believe that our ErgoD2 platform may play an essential role in achieving iron homeostasis in various disease states and will be the core of our innovative product offerings.  Our clinical studies aim to evaluate the nutritional effects of ErgoD2 in iron homeostasis, red blood cell production, neuronal function, and the immune system.  We hope to further prove that our products containing ErgoD2 are applicable to and will aid in the nutritional management of diseases such as chronic kidney disease, autism, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and others.

Chronic kidney disease.  During 2015, we undertook our first major clinical study focused on a particular disease – chronic kidney disease (“CKD”).  In the United States alone, more than one in ten adults or approximately 25 million persons suffer from early to late-stage CKD.  Most CKD patients only see a primary care physician and have limited access to therapy beyond suggested lifestyle modifications (dietary restrictions and iron supplementation).  The prevalence of anemia is approximately 16% in CKD or four million people.  In addition, more than 600,000 U.S. patients are being treated for end-stage renal disease by dialysis or kidney transplantation.  We believe that our products will become a widely used, cost-effective companion therapies in treating this disease, reducing mortality risks and improving quality of life.  This combinational approach also seeks to reduce the amount of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ("ESAs") and other expensive drugs needed for treatment, possibly increasing the bottom line for dialysis providers that are subject to capped reimbursement rates.  According to the National Kidney Foundation, about $68 billion was spent in treating CKD patients in 2013, not including prescription medications.  Accordingly, we believe that CKD offers a significant opportunity for Entia.
 
Other diseases.  Several additional market opportunities in which ErgoD2 may apply are available to Entia in the form of other diseases.  For example, autism affects over three million individuals in the U.S. and tens of millions worldwide and U.S. government autism statistics suggest that prevalence rates have increased ten to 17 percent annually in recent years. As other examples, there are more than one million people living with Parkinson’s disease in the U.S. and another 300,000 with multiple sclerosis.  In our opinion, ErgoD2 does not just apply in CKD, autism or Parkinson’s, but also potentially in a number of auto-immune conditions in which iron is a factor, including diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis (joints), psoriasis (skin/nails), and alopecia (hair).
 
Dietary Supplements
 
Definition.  According to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), dietary supplements are products which are not pharmaceutical drugs, food additives like spices or preservatives, or conventional food, and which also meet any of these criteria:

1. | The product is intended to supplement a person's diet, despite it not being usable as a meal replacement.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | The product is or contains a vitamin, dietary element, herb used for herbalism or botanical used as a medicinal plant, amino acid, any substance which contributes to other food eaten, or any concentrate, metabolite, ingredient, extract, or combination of these things.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | The product is labeled as a dietary supplement.
---+------------------------------------------------



In the United States, the FDA has different monitoring procedures for substances depending on whether they are presented as drugs, food additives, food, or dietary supplements.  Dietary supplements are eaten or taken by mouth, and are regulated in United States law as a type of food rather than a type of drug.  Like food and unlike drugs, no government approval is required to make or sell dietary supplements; the manufacturer checks the safety of dietary supplements but the government does not; and rather than requiring risk–benefit analysis to prove that the product can be sold like a drug, risk–benefit analysis is only used to petition that food or a dietary supplement is unsafe and should be removed from market.
 
Medical uses.  The intended use of dietary supplements is to ensure that a person receives enough essential nutrients.  Dietary supplements should not be used to treat any disease or as preventive healthcare.  An exception to this recommendation is the appropriate use of vitamins.  We believe that our dietary supplement offerings containing ErgoD2 will allow provision of appropriate amounts of essential nutrients, including L-ergothioneine and vitamin D2.
 
Medical Foods
 
We continue to explore integrating into these existing market opportunities by leveraging the regulatory advantages contained in the Orphan Drug Act (21 U.S.C. 360ee (b) (3)) and the 1988 Orphan Drug Act Amendments related to medical foods.  Medical foods are foods that are specially formulated and intended for the dietary management of a disease that has distinctive nutritional needs that cannot be met by normal diet alone.  Unlike common OTC supplements for general wellness, which are not allowed to make claims of efficacy, medical foods are used under medical supervision to tackle nutritional deficiencies related to a specific medical condition or disease being treated.  When used in conjunction with existing medical therapies, medical foods may also reduce required medication dosages and can be effective in preventing or reducing the associated side effects.  Although medical foods are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act regulations 21 CFR 101.9(j) (8), they are not required to undergo premarket review or approval by the FDA.  Additionally, they are exempted from the labeling requirements for health claims and nutrient content claims under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990.  Also, this significantly decreases the overall timing, investment, and risks typically associated with bringing a new pharmaceutical to market.

A medical food, as defined in the Orphan Drug Act, is "a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enternally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation." A food is subject to this exemption only if:
 
 
• | It is a specially formulated and processed product (as opposed to a naturally occurring foodstuff used in its natural state) for the partial or exclusive feeding of a patient by means of oral intake or enteral feeding by tube;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | It is intended for the dietary management of a patient who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, has limited or impaired capacity to ingest, digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients, or who has other special medically determined nutrient requirements, the dietary management of which cannot be achieved by the modification of the normal diet alone;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | It provides nutritional support specifically modified for the management of the unique nutrient needs that result from the specific disease or condition, as determined by medical evaluation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | It is intended to be used under medical supervision; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | It is intended only for a patient receiving active and ongoing medical supervision wherein the patient requires medical care on a recurring basis for, among other things, instructions on the use of the medical food.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



To bring ErgoD2-based medical foods to market, we plan to clinically validate their efficacy through independent studies that will comprehensively evaluate disease-associated biomarkers and their relationship with markers of iron regulation, and assess the ability to improve quality of life and health.  Our upcoming follow-on clinical studies will focus on neurodegenerative and auto-immune conditions, as funding allows.
 
ErgoD2
 
Our ErgoD2 formulations utilize specialty mushrooms available from a number of domestic and international suppliers.  These mushrooms are a food and are generally regarded as safe ("GRAS").  Our market and scientific research has identified mushroom species and suppliers to provide the superior nutritional profiles for our ErgoD2 formulations.  We systematically test our raw and finished ingredients to ensure quality control and confirm that these nutritional profiles are maintained.
 
The mushroom fruit bodies are dried, milled into powder, blended, and then enhanced using a patented UV light enrichment process that naturally increases vitamin D2 content by over 2,000% within seconds.  We have also developed extraction methods that separate the Ergo and other water-soluble cofactors from the D2, chitin-glucans and other solids contained in the UV-enriched powder.  These functional ingredients can then be encapsulated or used in medical foods and other branded products.  Our manufacturing processes for ErgoD2 are FDA certified and are performed in-house by Entia technicians.  We intend to expand our manufacturing capacity and efficiency as funding allows, as well as depending upon contract manufacturing, as necessary.
 
Functional Ingredients
 
L-ergothioneine (Ergo) is a naturally occurring amino acid and master antioxidant that mammals are incapable of producing.  Acquired exclusively from the diet, Ergo is delivered to cells throughout the body by a unique and specific genetic transporter (human gene symbol SLC22A4).  Research studies and peer-reviewed articles have reported that Ergo has the ability to act as a chelator and/or regulator for iron and is a potent cytoprotectant that is required for normal cell physiology and DNA protection from free radicals.
 
Working with Lifespan Biosciences in 2011 and 2012, we identified an antibody that detects Ergo transporter activity in both human and animal tissues using immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Our research has confirmed high concentrations of the Ergo transporter in a number of serious non-communicable chronic conditions and at the sites of rapidly dividing cells (macrophages and stem cells) suggesting the body genetically employs Ergo to prevent and/or repair damage from inflammation and free radicals and to support the production and maintenance of healthy cells.
 
Vitamin D is an essential antioxidant that is frequently called the “sunshine vitamin.”  Vitamin D can be manufactured in mammals through skin exposure to sunlight or ingested from the diet.  Like Ergo, sufficient levels of vitamin D are vital to upkeep of a strong immune system and cell proliferation and differentiation.  Deficiency has been linked to various health problems including CKD, hair loss, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, inflammatory illnesses, depression, multiple sclerosis, and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Vitamin D is primarily available in two active forms, ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), and is an important food additive currently used in a variety of fortified food products including milk, margarine, cereal, orange juice, and vitamin supplements.  Vitamin D2 is plant-based and produced in naturally high concentrations within mushrooms.  Ingestible forms of vitamin D3 are typically non-vegan and extracted from animal lanolin or chemically synthesized.  Entia’s patented UV light enrichment technology naturally increases the D2 content in mushrooms by more than 2,000% within seconds.
 
Our Products
 
We have been developing and studying the application of our ErgoD2 platform technology and functional ingredients in medical foods and other consumer health and wellness brands that address significant, high dollar-value market opportunities.  Although our initial focus will be on dietary supplements, we have developed and marketed both nutraceuticals (supplements) and cosmeceuticals, and continue to explore introduction of products in the medical foods category.

On November 10, 2009, we acquired rights to the patent application PCT/U.S. 2008/056234 Serial number 12/529,859 entitled “Use of Ergothioneine as a Preservative in Foods and Beverages.”  The transfer of the patent to Entia was subject to an “Assignment and Assumption” agreement between Dr. Philip Sobol, Dr. Robert Beelman, and Dr. Marvin Hausman.  Under that agreement, Entia agreed to issue a maximum of 150,000 shares of common stock to the assignors upon the first to occur of the following events: upon issuance of the patent in the U.S. (100,000 shares), upon issuance of the patent in the first European Union jurisdiction (50,000 shares), if Entia enters into a license agreement for the patent with any third party (150,000 shares), or upon the successful commercialization of any product or technology covered by the patent (50,000 shares).  Upon the successful commercialization of any product or technology covered by the patent, we will pay the assignors a royalty equal to 3% of net sales of any such product or technology and/or 20% of any sublicensing payments if the patent is sublicensed.  The patent was issued in Canada in February 2011 and 100,000 shares were issued on April 27, 2011. 
 
Production, Distribution and Marketing
 
In 2012, Entia began to integrate the enrichment, encapsulation and bottling process of its supplement products into its manufacturing, fulfillment and operations center located in Sherwood, Oregon.  During 2013, we expanded our production capabilities to include the manufacturing & bottling process related to our GROH-branded soaps, lotions and conditioners, since licensed to a third party.
 
We utilize several methods of marketing and distribution for our branded products.  Consumer products are and will continue to be marketed directly to the consumer, primarily through the internet utilizing a variety of e-commerce channels, such as, direct email marketing, social media outlets and e-commerce sites like Amazon.com.     
 
Competitive Environment
 
The dietary supplements and medical foods markets are highly competitive, with many well-known and established suppliers. These industries are subject to rapid change with new products frequently being introduced into the market.  Our ability to remain competitive depends on our ability to develop and manufacture new products in a timely and cost effective manner, to accurately predict market transitions, and to effectively market our products.  Our future financial results will depend to a great extent on the successful introduction of new products.  We cannot be certain that we will be successful in selecting, developing, contract manufacturing and marketing new products.
 
The success of new product introductions depends on various factors, including, but not limited to the following:
 
 
· | proper new selection and product development;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | availability of raw materials;
--+-------------------------------


· | pricing of raw materials;
--+--------------------------


· | timely delivery of new products;
--+---------------------------------


· | regulatory allowance of the products; and
--+------------------------------------------


· | appropriate pricing and customer acceptance of new products
--+------------------------------------------------------------

We face challenges in developing new products, primarily those of funding development costs and diversion of management time.  On a regular basis, we evaluate opportunities to develop new products through product line extensions and product modifications.  There is no assurance that we will successfully develop product line extensions or integrate newly developed products into our business.  In addition, there are no assurances that newly developed products will contribute favorably to our operations and financial condition.  Our failure to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis could adversely affect our future operating results.
 
Industry
 
Our markets, particularly the nutritional supplements and beauty industries are intensely competitive.
 
The dietary supplements, nutritional supplements (nutraceuticals) and medical foods industries include companies that manufacture and distribute products which are generally intended to enhance the body's performance as well as to enhance well-
 
being.  Nutritional supplements include vitamins, minerals, dietary supplements, herbs, botanicals and compounds derived therefrom.  Opportunities in the nutritional supplements industry were enhanced by the enactment of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ("DSHEA").  Under DSHEA, vendors of dietary supplements are able to educate consumers regarding the effects of certain component ingredients, however, they are subject to many existing and proposed regulations regarding labeling and advertising of such products.  See “Government Regulation” below.
 
Competition
 
Supplements industry.  The dietary and nutritional supplements industry (includes nutraceuticals and medical foods) is quite fragmented, with many small and large companies participating.  The fragmented nature of the industry offers scope for mergers, acquisitions and new companies to rise to leadership positions provided they bring new innovative products to the market.  The major players in the global dietary and nutritional supplements industry include Nestlé, Atrium Innovations, Glanbia Plc, NBTY Inc., Herbalife Ltd and others.
 
These companies market and distribute their products through various channels including: retail, multi-level marketing, e-commerce, and direct to consumer marketing (direct mail, television & radio infomercials, and email).
 
The market is highly sensitive to the introduction of new products and management has positioned Entia as an emerging dietary and nutraceuticals company with collaborative research projects at major universities, including but not limited to Massachusetts General Hospital, Pennsylvania State University, and the University of Cologne.  This position has allowed us to license and build upon a significant portfolio of intellectual property, which is being utilized to secure proprietary nature of our manufacturing process and our intended new products applications.  Furthermore, we will align our products, when advantageous, to take advantage the rules of and protections granted under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (“DSHEA”), as well as the Orphan Drug Act, which allows for the development of medical foods to aid in dietary conditions related to specific disease conditions.  This approach will aid us in introducing specific, innovative products to market.
 
Government Regulation
 
Dietary and Nutritional Supplements
 
DSHEA defines the term "dietary supplement" to mean a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: a vitamin, a mineral, an herb or other botanical, an amino acid, a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any of the aforementioned ingredients.  Furthermore, a dietary supplement must be labeled as a dietary supplement and be intended for ingestion and must not be represented for use as conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or of the diet.  In addition, a dietary supplement cannot be approved or authorized for investigation as a new drug, antibiotic, or biologic, unless it was marketed as a food or a dietary supplement before such approval or authorization.  Under DSHEA, dietary supplements are deemed to be food, except for purposes of the drug definition.
 
Dietary supplements labels.  A "label" is a display of written, printed, or graphic material on the supplement container. DSHEA and other federal regulations require the following information to appear on dietary supplement labels:
 
 
· | a statement of identity that contains the words "dietary supplement." The word "dietary" may be replaced by the name of the dietary ingredient (e.g., "ginseng supplement"); 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | net quantity of contents (for example, "60 capsules");
--+-------------------------------------------------------



10
 

 
· | nutrition information in the form of a "Supplement Facts" panel, including the product serving size, the amount, and percent daily value, if established, of each dietary ingredient;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | if a supplement contains a proprietary blend, the net weight of the blend as well as a listing of each ingredient in descending order of weight must be identified;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the part of the plant used, if an herb or botanical;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a complete list of ingredients by their common or usual names, either in descending order of prominence or with the source of the dietary ingredient in the "Supplement Facts" panel, following the name of the dietary ingredient;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | safety information that is considered "material" to the consequences that may result from the use of the supplement;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the disclaimer "This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease" if the supplement bears a claim to affect the structure or function of the body (structure/function claim), a claim of general well-being, or a claim of a benefit related to a classical nutrient deficiency disease; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | At their discretion, manufacturers may add additional information on labels (such as claims and statements of quality assurance), and may decide on the placement of that information on their labels.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FDA and DSHEA.  Under the act, supplement manufacturers do not need to receive FDA approval before marketing dietary supplements that were marketed in the United States before 1994.  Dietary ingredients not so grandfathered are defined as New Dietary Ingredients in 21 U.S.C. 350b(d), and notifications of providing reasonable evidence of their safety, or reasonable expectations of their safety, must be reviewed and approved by the FDA prior to their marketing.
Medical Foods
 
The term “medical food” means a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation.
In the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (“NLEA”), Congress incorporated the definition of medical foods contained in the Orphan Drug Amendments of 1988 into 21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(A)(iv) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and exempted medical foods from the nutrition labeling, health claim, and nutrient content claim requirements applicable to most other foods.  The final rule on mandatory labeling (58 FR 2079 at 2151, January 6, 1993) exempted medical foods from the nutrition labeling requirements and incorporated the statutory definition of a medical food into the agency’s regulations in regulation 21 C.F.R. § 101.9(j)(8).  The FDA enumerated criteria that were intended to clarify the characteristics of medical foods.  The regulation provides that a food may claim the exemption from nutrition labeling requirements only if it meets the following criteria:

· | It is a specially formulated and processed product (as opposed to a naturally occurring foodstuff used in its natural state) for the partial or exclusive feeding of a patient by means of oral intake or enteral feeding by tube;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | It is intended for the dietary management of a patient who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, has limited or impaired capacity to ingest, digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients, or who has other special medically determined nutrient requirements, the dietary management of which cannot be achieved by the modification of the normal diet alone;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | It provides nutritional support specifically modified for the management of the unique nutrient needs that result from the specific disease or condition, as determined by medical evaluation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | It is intended to be used under medical supervision; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | It is intended only for a patient receiving active and ongoing medical supervision wherein the patient requires medical care on a recurring basis for, among other things, instructions on the use of the medical food.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Medical Foods are Protected Under the Proxmire Amendments and DSHEA
 
Congress enacted legislation (Pub. L. 94-278, Title V, April 22, 1976) that became section 411 of the act (21 USC 350) (known as the “Proxmire Amendment”).  This amendment prevents the FDA from classifying any vitamin or mineral as a drug solely because it exceeds a potency level that is deemed to have a nutritionally sound rationale.  In order to be excluded from regulation as a "drug" under the provisions of 21 USC § 350(a) and 21 USC § 350(b) or, in other words, in order to be a food to which 21 USC § 350 applies, a product must, under the definition of that phrase in 21 USC § 350(c), be a food for humans which is a food for special dietary use, (A) which is [a] vitamin . . . , and (B) which – (i) is intended for ingestion in tablet, capsule, powder, softgel, gelcap, or liquid form, or (ii) if not intended for ingestion in such a form, is not represented as conventional food and is not represented for use as a sole item of a meal or of a diet.  (See United States v. Ten Cartons, 888 F. Supp. 381, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3925 (E.D.N.Y.1995)).
