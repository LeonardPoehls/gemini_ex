DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 

Our Corporate History and Background
 
Stony Hill Corp. was incorporated on February 21, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada, under the name “First Fixtures, Inc.” We amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to “Stony Hill Corp.” on October 13, 2016. From our formation on February 21, 2014 until November 4, 2016, we were engaged in the business of being an online shopping mall specializing in bathroom and kitchen fixtures and faucets. Colin Povall served as President, Treasurer and sole director from February 21, 2014, until his resignation on October 3, 2016. Concurrent with his resignation, Mr. Povall appointed Damian Marley as the President and Chief Executive Officer, and sole member of the Board of Directors, Dan Dalton as the Treasurer, and John Brady as the Secretary, of the Company. On February 10, 2017, the board of directors appointed Chris Bridges as our President. Concurrent with the appointment of Mr. Bridges, Damian “Jr. Gong” Marley resigned as our President and Chief Executive Officer. Effective March 9, 2017, Chris Bridges was also appointed a director of the Company. Accordingly, Damian Marley and Chris Bridges comprise the board of directors of the Company.
 
From inception until we completed our reverse acquisition of Stony Hill Ventures, we were engaged in the principal business of being online shopping mall specializing in bathroom and kitchen fixtures and faucets.
 
Reverse Acquisition of Stony Hill Ventures
 
On November 4, 2016, Stony Hill Corp. entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), by and among the Company, Stony Hill Ventures Corp., a Nevada corporation (“Stony Hill Ventures”), and the holders of common stock of Stony Hill Ventures. The holders of the common stock of Stony Hill Ventures consisted of 26 stockholders.
 
Prior to the share exchange, 6,002,584 shares of the Company's common stock were cancelled. Under the terms and conditions of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company offered, sold and issued 10,840,000 shares of common stock in consideration for all the issued and outstanding shares in Stony Hill Ventures. The effect of the issuance was that Stony Hill Ventures shareholders held, at the time, approximately 73% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. 
 
As of November 4, 2016, Damian Marley, the Company’s then new President and Chief Executive Officer, and then sole member of the Board of Directors, was the holder of 3,150,000 shares of common stock of the Company. Dan Dalton, the Company’s new Treasurer, was the holder of 2,250,000 shares of common stock of the Company. John Brady, the Company’s new Secretary, is holder of 2,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company. The Company’s officers and sole director, therefore, controlled an aggregate of 7,400,000, or approximately 48.5%, of the outstanding common stock of the Company, on a fully diluted basis, upon completion of the transaction.
 
As a result of the share exchange, Stony Hill Ventures is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 
 
The share exchange transaction with Stony Hill Ventures was treated as a reverse acquisition, with Stony Hill Ventures as the acquiror and the Company as the acquired party. Unless the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this Form 8-K to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the reverse acquisition, we are referring to the business and financial information of Stony Hill Ventures.

Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired 80% of those certain assets that comprise the VitaCBD business (the “Assets”) from mCig, and an option (the “Option”) to acquire the remaining 20% of assets related to the Assets for a purchase price of $200,000. The VitaCBD business is primarily a line of cannabidiol (“CBD”) retail products available for purchase at vitacbd.com, which products include CBD tinctures, ejuices, edibles, islates, salves, waxes, oils and capsules, as well as related trade names, social media, accounts and other related assets. Information on the vitacbd.com website is not part of the disclosure on this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The purchase price the Company paid for the Assets was $150,000 and 200,000 shares of the common stock of the Company. Additionally, on May 24, 2017, the Company was obligated to issue (the “Second Stock Issuance”) to mCig either (i)150,000 shares of the Company’s common stock or (ii) that number of shares of common stock of the Company valued at $300,000, whichever has a lesser “Market Value,” defined as average of the closing prices for the common stock of the Company on any quotation tier of the OTC Markets, as reported by the OTC Markets, for the 90 trading days subsequent to February 23, 2017.

If the market value of the Second Issuance on the anniversary date of such issuance is greater than $300,000, the additional value shall be offset against of the purchase price of the Option to purchase the remaining 20% of assets related to the Assets.

If the average during any 7-day period during the first year following the Second Stock Issuance, the Market Value of the share of common stock of the Company owned by mCig is less than $550,000 (which amount represents the minimum target Market Value of the shares of common stock of the Company held by mCig immediately following the issuance of shares of common stock of the Company), then the Company is obligated to issue to mCig that additional number of common stock of the Company, on the one year anniversary date, to increase the Market Value of the total outstanding shares of common stock of the Company held by mCig to $550,000, without the payment of any additional consideration.
 
In connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company also entered into a Lock-up Agreement dated February 23, 2017, with mCig, pursuant to which mCig agreed to not resell any shares of common stock it received in connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement for a period of one year.
