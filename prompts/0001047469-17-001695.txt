  Overview 
         We are a clinical-stage gene therapy company dedicated to developing and commercializing novel treatments for patients suffering from rare and life-threatening neurological genetic diseases. Our initial product candidate, AVXS-101, is our proprietary gene therapy product candidate. We recently completed our Phase 1 clinical trial for AVXS-101 for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy Type 1, or SMA Type 1, the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMA Type 1 is a lethal genetic disorder characterized by motor neuron loss and associated muscle deterioration, resulting in mortality or the need for permanent ventilation support before the age of two for greater than 90% of patients. The survival motor neuron protein, or SMN, is a critical protein for normal motor neuron signaling and function. Patients with SMA Type 1 either have experienced a deletion of their  SMN1 genes, which prevents them from producing adequate levels of functional SMN protein, or carry a mutation in their  SMN1 gene. AVXS-101 is designed to deliver a fully functional human SMN gene into the nuclei of motor neurons that then generates an increase in SMN protein levels and we believe this will result in improved motor neuron function and patient outcomes. 
         In our fully enrolled Phase 1 clinical trial, we treated 15 SMA Type 1 patients, divided into two dosing cohorts, and observed a favorable safety profile and that AVXS-101 is generally well-tolerated. As of January 20, 2017, all patients in the study have survived (in contrast to the independent, peer-reviewed natural history study for patients with SMA Type 1 described further in "Background on Spinal Muscular AtrophySMA Type 1"). Additionally, we have observed improved motor function, including the attainment of motor milestones such as the ability to sit unassisted, crawl, stand and walk, that are essentially never seen among untreated patients suffering from SMA Type 1. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, have each granted AVXS-101 orphan drug designation for the treatment of SMA, and the FDA has granted AVXS-101 fast track designation for the treatment of SMA Type 1. The FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for AVXS-101 for the treatment of SMA Type 1 in pediatric patients, and the EMA granted access into its PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, program for AVXS-101 for the treatment of SMA Type 1. Pending the outcome of our planned Type B meeting with the FDA to discuss chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, which has been rescheduled to May 1, 2017, we intend to initiate a pivotal trial of AVXS-101 for the treatment of SMA Type 1 in the United States during the first half of 2017 and in Europe during the second half of 2017, and we also intend to initiate a Phase 1 safety and dose escalation study of AVXS-101 via intrathecal delivery in patients with SMA Type 2 in the second quarter of 2017. In addition to developing AVXS-101 to treat SMA Type 1, we plan to develop AVXS-101 to treat additional SMA types and develop other novel treatments for rare neurological genetic diseases. 
         SMA is a severe neuromuscular disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons leading to progressive muscle weakness and paralysis. The incidence of SMA is approximately one in 10,000 live births. SMA is generally divided into sub-categories termed SMA Type 1, 2, 3 and 4. SMA, and the SMA sub-types, are diagnosed first by identifying the existence of a genetic defect in the  SMN1 gene and then by determining the number of copies of the SMN2 backup gene, which correlates with disease onset and severity. If insufficient protein is expressed, muscles do not develop properly. In the incident population, approximately 60% of SMA patients have Type 1, the most severe type of SMA, with observation of disease symptoms within six months of birth. Patients with SMA Type 1 have difficulty breathing and swallowing and in terms of motor function, will never develop the strength to sit up independently or the ability to crawl or walk. Patients with SMA Type 1 frequently die in early childhood due to complications related to respiratory failure resulting from motor neuron degeneration. The standard of care for patients with SMA has been generally limited to palliative therapies, including 
 1

   life-long respiratory care, ventilator support, nutritional care, orthopedic care and physical therapy. In December 2016, the FDA approved SPINRAZA (nusinersen), developed by Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., for the treatment of SMA. Nusinersen involves a different approach to treating SMA from AVXS-101, called alternative splicing, which seeks to achieve increased production of full-length SMN protein from the back-up SMN2 gene. However, we believe that there remains significant interest in a gene replacement therapy for SMA that can act on the underlying defect in the primary gene (SMN1) and that can provide enhanced survival and motor function benefit via a one-time dose. 
         We believe gene therapy is a therapeutic approach that is well-suited for the treatment of SMA due to the monogenic nature of the disease, meaning it is caused by mutations in or deletions of a single gene. AVXS-101 is designed to possess the key elements of an optimal gene therapy approach to SMA, potentially enabling a one-time dose regimen: delivery of a fully functional human SMN gene into target motor neuron cells; production of sufficient levels of SMN protein required to improve motor neuron function; and rapid onset of effect in addition to sustained SMN gene expression. AVXS-101 utilizes a non-replicating adeno-associated virus, or AAV, capsid to deliver a functional copy of a human SMN gene to the patient's own cells without modifying the existing DNA of the patient. Unlike many other capsids, the AAV9 capsid utilized in AVXS-101 crosses the blood-brain barrier, a tight protective barrier which regulates the passage of substances between the bloodstream and the brain, thus allowing for intravenous administration. In addition, AAV9 has been observed in preclinical studies to efficiently target motor neuron cells when delivered via either intrathecal or intravenous administration. AVXS-101 has a self-complementary DNA sequence that enables rapid onset of effect and a continuous promoter that is intended to allow for continuous and sustained SMN gene expression. 
         In April 2014, an open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical trial of AVXS-101 in patients with SMA Type 1 was initiated at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, or NCH. In December 2015, we had fully enrolled our Phase 1 trial, having dosed a total of 15 patients in the trial. The primary analysis for efficacy was assessed in January 2017 when all patients reached 13.6 months of age. We will conduct a follow-up safety analysis when the last patient enrolled in the trial reaches 24 months post-dose. The primary outcome measure of the trial was safety and tolerability. The key measures of efficacy were time from birth until an "event," which was defined as death or at least 16 hours per day of required ventilation support for breathing for 14 consecutive days in the absence of acute reversible illness or perioperatively, and video confirmed achievement of ability to sit unassisted. In September 2014, dosing was completed for the first cohort of three patients, who received a dose of AVXS-101 administered at 6.7 × 1013 vector genomes per kilogram, or vg/kg, or the low dose, and in December 2015, we completed the dosing of 12 patients in the second cohort, who received the 2.0 × 1014 vg/kg dose, or the proposed one-time therapeutic dose. Use of the term "proposed therapeutic dose" does not imply that we have established efficacy, but this one-time dose is the dosing level that we presently intend to evaluate in future trials. We will likely be required to conduct a pivotal trial followed by review and approval of the product candidate by the FDA before making any claims of efficacy as to our product candidate or the appropriate dose. 
         Based on the top-line results of the trial reported at the primary analysis for efficacy as of January 20, 2017, no patient receiving the proposed therapeutic dose of AVXS-101 has experienced an event. As of January 20, 2017, all patients have experienced improvement in motor function relative to their baseline measurement, as measured by The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders, or CHOP INTEND, a test developed to measure motor skills of patients with SMA Type 1. Mean increases from baseline in CHOP INTEND scores of 7.7 points in the low-dose cohort and 24.7 points in the proposed therapeutic-dose cohort were observed, reflecting improvement in motor function. At the most recent evaluations prior to January 20, 2017, eleven out of 12 patients (92%), 10 out of 12 patients (83%) and two out of 12 patients (17%) in the proposed 
 2

   therapeutic-dose cohort have achieved CHOP INTEND scores of at least 40 points, 50 points or 60 points, respectively. Two patients achieved the maximum CHOP INTEND score of 64. A CHOP INTEND score of 60 points is in a range considered to be normal. Based on our observations to date, we believe that increases in CHOP INTEND motor assessments appear to be age, baseline CHOP INTEND score and dose-dependent. In addition, as of January 20, 2017, 11 of 12 patients (92%) in the proposed therapeutic-dose cohort achieved head control, nine of 12 patients (75%) could roll a minimum of 180 degrees from back to both left and right, and 11 of 12 patients (92%) could sit with assistance. For the end-of-study assessment, we evaluated three validated and well-established measures of sitting unassisted for periods of increasing duration. Nine of 12 patients (75%) could sit unassisted for at least five seconds, seven of 12 patients (58%) could sit unassisted for at least 10 seconds and five of 12 patients (42%) could sit unassisted for 30 seconds or more. Two patients could walk independently and each had achieved earlier and important developmental milestones, such as standing with support, standing alone and walking with support. These milestone achievements were assessed and adjudicated by an independent third party reviewer using video evidence. As of January 20, 2017, AVXS-101 appears to have a favorable safety profile and appears to be generally well-tolerated in the Phase 1 patients studied to date. 
         We have an exclusive, worldwide license with Nationwide Children's Hospital, or NCH, under certain patent applications related to both the intravenous and intrathecal delivery of AVXS-101 for the treatment of all types of SMA, and an exclusive, worldwide license from a predecessor to REGENXBIO Inc., or REGENXBIO, under certain patents and patent applications owned by the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania and licensed to REGENXBIO, to use the AAV9 capsid for the in vivo gene therapy treatment of SMA in humans. In addition, we have a non-exclusive, worldwide license agreement with Asklepios BioPharmaceutical Inc., or AskBio, under certain patents and patent applications owned by the University of North Carolina and licensed to AskBio for the use of its self-complementary DNA technology for the treatment of SMA. 
         In 2013, AveXis entered into an exclusive license agreement with NCH. We formed a collaboration with NCH to explore the use of gene therapy for the treatment of SMA and secured our first institutional investors and expanded our leadership team. Our current operations are a result of this collaboration with NCH and research conducted by our Chief Scientific Officer, Brian Kaspar, Ph.D. Dr. Kaspar has over 20 years of gene therapy experience, and is currently on entrepreneurial leave of absence from NCH to serve full-time as AveXis' Chief Scientific Officer. NCH is a leading pediatric gene therapy research institute. 
         On July 20, 2016, we reported that the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for AVXS-101 for the treatment of SMA Type 1 in pediatric patients. The FDA established breakthrough therapy designation to facilitate dialogue between the FDA and the sponsor to provide advice on generating evidence needed to support approval of the therapy in an efficient manner with more intensive and interactive guidance on an efficient drug development program, an organizational commitment involving the FDA's senior managers, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. At the FDA's request, in September 2016, we participated in a Type B meeting focused on a multidisciplinary, comprehensive discussion of the development program for AVXS-101. On November 1, 2016, we announced that we had received the FDA's written minutes from the September 30, 2016 Type B Meeting and that our planned pivotal trial of AVXS-101 for the treatment of SMA Type 1 will reflect a single-arm design, using natural history of the disease as a comparator, and enroll approximately 20 patients. We anticipate that we will conduct a Type B CMC meeting with the FDA on May 1 2017, and, pending the outcome of this meeting, we intend to initiate the pivotal trial in the United States during the first half of 2017. Following the Type B CMC meeting with the FDA, we intend to schedule an End of Phase 1 meeting with the FDA in the second or third quarter of 2017 to discuss the potential that our Phase 1 study of AVXS-101 may contain the "substantial evidence of effectiveness" to support a license application.

           On January 31, 2017, we announced that the EMA granted AVXS-101 access into its PRIME program for therapy for the treatment of SMA Type 1. The PRIME application was based on data from both preclinical evaluations and the Phase 1 clinical trial of AVXS-101 as of September 15, 2016. PRIME is intended to enhance support for the development of medicinesspecifically those that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments or benefit patients without treatment optionsthrough early and proactive support by EMA to optimize the generation of robust data and development plans, and potentially expedite the assessment of the marketing authorization application so these medicines may reach patients sooner. On February 6, 2017, we announced that our planned pivotal trial of AVXS-101 in SMA Type 1 in the European Union will reflect a single-arm design, using natural history of the disease as a comparator, and will enroll approximately 30 patients. This update was based on the receipt of the Scientific Advice response from the Scientific Advice Working Party within the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA. Pending the outcome of our planned Type B CMC meeting [and a comprehensive program review with the EMA, that we expect to be scheduled in the second or third quarter of 2017], we intend to initiate the pivotal trial in Europe during the second half of 2017. In addition, the EMA has indicated that it wishes to discuss the potential that the data from our Phase 1 study of AVXS-101 may meet the evidentiary requirements for the conditional approval pathway in the European Union. 
         To execute on AveXis' mission, we have assembled a management team that includes individuals with expertise in gene therapy, regulatory development, product and clinical development, manufacturing, medical affairs and commercialization, with a history of success in building and operating innovative biotechnology and healthcare companies focused on rare and life-threatening diseases. This team is led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Sean P. Nolan, who brings 25 years of broad leadership and management experience in the biopharmaceutical industry to AveXis. Most recently Mr. Nolan was the chief business officer of InterMune, Inc. where he led multiple functions across the organization, including North American commercial operations, global marketing, corporate and business development, and global manufacturing and supply chain. Our other management team members also have successful track records developing and commercializing drugs through previous experiences at companies such as Abbott Laboratories, Amgen, Auspex, Centocor, InterMune, Hospira, MedImmune, Novartis, Pfizer, Daiichi Sankyo and Quest Diagnostics. 
   Our Strategy 
         We are building a patient-centric business with the goal of developing innovative gene therapy treatments that transform the lives of patients and their families suffering from rare and life-threatening neurological genetic diseases. In order to accomplish this goal, we plan to execute on the following key strategies: 


 Rapidly advance our SMA Type 1 program through clinical trials in the United
States.  We recently announced the completion of our fully-enrolled, open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical trial of AVXS-101 in
patients with SMA Type 1 at NCH, in which we dosed a total of 15 patients in two dosing cohorts. The FDA has granted AVXS-101 orphan drug designation for the treatment of all types of SMA, fast
track designation for the treatment of SMA Type 1 and breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of SMA Type 1 in pediatric patients. Our planned U.S. pivotal trial of AVXS-101
for the treatment of SMA Type 1, which we intend to initiate in the first half of 2017 pending the outcome of our Type B CMC meeting with the FDA, will reflect a single-arm design, using
natural history of the disease as a comparator, and enroll approximately 15 patients. 
 Expand the development of AVXS-101 into SMA Types 2 and
3.  Based on preclinical data and our preliminary clinical observations to date, we believe AVXS-101 may also have the ability to treat patients
with SMA Types 2 and 3, which result from the same genetic defect as SMA Type 1. We 

 4

   

intend
to initiate a Phase 1 safety and dosing escalation study of AVXS-101 via intrathecal delivery in patients with SMA Type 2 in the second quarter of 2017. 


 Advance the development of AVXS-101 outside of the United
States.  The incidence, standard of care and prognosis of SMA globally are generally consistent. With no approved treatments as of the date of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe there is significant unmet need for patients suffering from SMA outside the U.S. In January 2017, we announced that the EMA granted AVXS-101 access
into its PRIME program for the treatment of SMA Type 1. Pending the outcome of our Type B CMC meeting with the FDA and a comprehensive program review with EMA, expected to be scheduled
in the second or third quarter of 2017, we intend to initiate our European pivotal trial of AVXS-101 for SMA Type 1 during the second half of 2017. In February 2017, we announced that this
pivotal trial will reflect a single-arm design, using natural history of the disease as a comparator, and will enroll approximately 30 patients. 
 Build a pipeline of gene therapy treatments for other rare and life-threatening
neurological genetic diseases.  In addition to our programs in SMA, we also intend to identify, acquire, develop and commercialize novel product
candidates for the treatment of other rare and life-threatening neurological genetic diseases with mechanisms of action that we believe can be treated with gene therapy. We intend to employ a targeted
approach to acquisition and licensing transactions reflecting our goal to be a leading gene therapy company focused on the treatment of rare and life-threatening neurological diseases. 
 Continue to invest in and develop robust and sustainable manufacturing processes and
multiple supply sources to ensure the supply of high-quality products.  To date, our manufacturing processes have been consistent with the stage
of product development that we are in. We have evaluated and are implementing a plan to scale up a manufacturing process to meet our needs in later-stage clinical trials. Based on emerging data from
our intended current commercial good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, development work and ongoing discussions with the FDA, we made the strategic decision to use our intended cGMP derived product in
all future studies of AVXS-101, including our planned trial of AVXS-101 for SMA Type 2. In addition to engaging third-party manufacturers, we are building our own commercial scale
cGMP-compliant manufacturing facility to provide multiple long-term supply alternatives to meet commercial demand in the event that AVXS-101 receives marketing approval. 
 Invest in developing and accessing intellectual property to further expand our product
portfolio.  To date, we have secured our intellectual property position through our agreements with our key collaborators and other third parties.
We plan to build upon this intellectual property position through additional patent applications related to AVXS-101. With respect to future product candidates, we expect to continue to work with
REGENXBIO and other creators of next generation vectors to ensure appropriate access to additional therapeutic candidates. 
 Continue to develop a strong, collaborative network of key stakeholders, including
patient advocacy groups, healthcare professionals, key opinion leaders and research institutions, to inform our clinical development and commercialization
strategies.  We believe that it is imperative to put the patient at the center of our focus, and we intend to continue to work and listen closely
to key stakeholders to ensure that we clearly understand their issues, insights and recommendations. The feedback from and collaboration with these groups have and will continue to inform our key
strategies to transform the lives of patients and their families suffering from rare and life-threatening neurological genetic diseases with safe and effective therapies. 

 Background on Gene Therapy 
         Many diseases are driven by genetic mutations in which the mutated genes can affect the production of proteins. Gene therapy attempts to address disease biology by introducing recombinant 
 5

   DNA into a patient's own cells, commonly in the form of a functional copy of the patient's defective gene, to address the genetic defect and modulate protein production and cellular function, which provides therapeutic benefit. 
         Using gene therapy, physicians can introduce or re-introduce genes that encode for a therapeutic protein. Instead of providing proteins or other therapies externally and dosing them over a long period, we believe gene therapy offers the possibility of dosing a patient once to achieve a long-term, durable benefit. Gene therapies are typically comprised of three elements: a transgene, a promoter and a delivery mechanism such as our AAV9 capsid. Once the therapeutic gene is transferred to a patient's cells, we believe the cells may be able to continue to produce the therapeutic protein for years or, potentially, the rest of the patient's life. As a result, gene therapy has the potential to transform the way these patients are treated by addressing the underlying genetic defect. 
   Background on Spinal Muscular Atrophy 
         SMA is a severe neuromuscular disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons leading to progressive muscle weakness and paralysis. The incidence of SMA is approximately one in 10,000 live births, and one in 50 people are carriers of the SMA gene (approximately six million Americans). SMA is generally divided into sub-categories termed SMA Type 1, 2, 3 and 4. SMA, and the SMA sub-types, the genetic diagnosis is made by first identifying the existence of a genetic defect in the  SMN1 gene and then determining the number of copies of the SMN2 backup gene, which correlates with disease onset and severity. If insufficient protein is expressed, muscles do not develop properly. Patients that have SMA Type 1, the most severe type of SMA, have an onset of symptoms within six months of birth, have difficulty breathing and swallowing and will never develop the strength or muscle control to sit up independently or the ability to crawl or walk. SMA Type 1 patients frequently die in early childhood due to complications related to respiratory failure resulting from motor neuron degeneration. Although SMA Types 2, 3 and 4 are generally less severe than SMA Type 1, they still present patients with significant medical challenges. The standard of care for patients with SMA Type 1 has traditionally been limited to palliative therapies, including life-long respiratory care, ventilator support, nutritional care, orthopedic care and physical therapy. In December 2016, the FDA approved SPINRAZATM (nusinersen), developed by Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., for the treatment of SMA. Nusinersen employs an approach for the treatment of SMA called alternative splicing, which seeks to achieve more efficient production of full-length SMN protein from the SMN2 gene. However, we believe that there is significant interest in a gene replacement therapy for SMA that can act on the underlying defect in the primary gene (SMN1) and can provide enhanced survival and motor function benefit via a one-time dose.. 
         SMA is caused by a genetic defect in the SMN1 gene that codes SMN, a protein necessary for survival of motor neurons. Although individuals typically receive one copy of the SMN1 gene from each parent, only one properly functioning SMN1 gene is required to generate adequate levels of full-length SMN protein. SMA results from the patient's lack of a properly functioning SMN1 gene, either due to mutation or loss of the gene. SMA is a recessive trait, meaning that while both parents of an SMA patient may be healthy, they each carry and pass along to their child DNA that contains either a mutated or missing SMN1 gene which results in the disease manifesting itself in the child. 
         Human DNA contains a backup to the SMN1 gene, the SMN2 gene. Individuals may carry multiple copies of the SMN2 backup gene within their DNA. However, approximately 90% of SMN protein produced by the  SMN2 backup gene is non-functional, truncated SMN protein missing a polypeptide segment (coded for by exon 7) that is essential to form a functional SMN molecule. The level of functional full-length SMN protein produced by an SMA patient's SMN2 genes is generally insufficient to prevent loss of proper motor neuron function. As the SMN2 genes are capable of producing minimal levels of full-length SMN protein, the number of copies of the  SMN2 backup gene serves as a disease modifier, such that the more copies of the SMN2 backup gene there are, the less 
 6

   severe the disease. The following diagram presents the difference between a healthy person and someone afflicted by SMA. 
 
        SMA is typically diagnosed based on the onset of clinical symptoms along with a genetic assessment of the absence of SMN1 and the number of copies of SMN2. However, a genetic diagnosis can also be made prenatally either through amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. 
         The following table describes the general disease onset, incidence rates, survival and general characteristics for each of the different types of SMA. 

   
SMA Type | Number of Copies of SMN2 | Onset | Incidence per Live Birth among SMA Types | Survival | Characteristics 
Type 1 (Werdnig-Hoffman Disease) | Two | Before six months | Approximately 58% | Less than 10% event free* by two years of age | Will never be able to sit without support 
Type 2 (Dubowitz Syndrome) | Three or Four | 6 - 18 months | Approximately 29% | 68% alive at age 25 | Will never be able to walk or stand without support 
Type 3 (Kugelberg-Welander Disease) | Three or Four | Early childhood to early adulthood (juvenile) | Approximately 13% | Normal | Stand alone and walk but may lose ability to walk in 30s - 40s
Type 4 | Four to Eight | Adulthood (20s - 30s) usually after 30 | Uncommon: limited incidence information available | Normal | Same as Type 3 


  *
An event is defined as death or at least 16 hours per day of required ventilation support for breathing for 14 consecutive days in the absence of acute reversible illness or perioperatively. 


  SMA Type 1 
         SMA Type 1 is a lethal genetic disorder characterized by motor neuron loss and associated muscle deterioration, resulting in mortality or the need for permanent ventilation support before the age of two for greater than 90% of patients. SMA Type 1 is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMA Type 1 accounts for approximately 60% of all new SMA cases. Symptoms of SMA Type 1 include:
 

 hypotonia, which is also known as "floppy baby syndrome" and is characterized by abnormal limpness in the neck and limbs; 
 muscle weakness, particularly in the legs; 

 7

   

 poor head control; 
 abdominal breathing, also known as diaphragmatic or belly breathing, which is characterized by breathing through the contracting of the
diaphragm rather than the chest; 
 bulbar muscle weakness, which is exhibited by a weak cry, difficulty swallowing and aspiration; and 
 the inability to sit unsupported. 

         In an independent, peer-reviewed natural history study published by the American Academy of Neurology on SMA Type 1 in 2014, or the Finkel 2014 Study, the authors observed that the life expectancy of a child with SMA Type 1 is, for a majority of patients, less than two years. The following chart presents the percentage of children with SMA Type 1 that die or require at least 16 hours per day of ventilation support for breathing at varying ages for 14 consecutive days in the absence of acute reversible illness or perioperatively, as observed in the Finkel 2014 Study, along with major developmental milestones for a healthy baby. Another published multi-center government funded study, or the NeuroNEXT Study, which examined the longitudinal, natural history of SMA Type 1, reconfirmed the findings from the Finkel 2014 Study on the life expectancy and developmental milestones for a child with SMA Type 1. 
 
  Existing Treatments for SMA 
         The standard of care for patients with SMA Type 1 has traditionally been limited to palliative therapies, including life-long respiratory care, ventilator support, nutritional care, orthopedic care and physical therapy. In December 2016, the FDA approved SPINRAZATM (nusinersen), developed by Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., for the treatment of SMA. Nusinersen employs an approach for the treatment of SMA called alternative splicing, which seeks to achieve more efficient production of full-length SMN protein from the SMN2 gene. However, we believe that there is significant interest in a gene replacement therapy that can act on the underlying defect in the primary gene (SMN1) and can provide enhanced survival and motor function benefit via a one-time dose. 
   Our Product Candidate: AVXS-101 for the Treatment of SMA Type 1 
         AVXS-101 is our proprietary gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of SMA Type 1. Because SMA is a neurodegenerative disease, reduced levels of SMN protein lead to continued degeneration. The goal of AVXS-101 is to give patients a one-time treatment to restore the body's production of SMN protein to prevent further degeneration. Based on observations of our Phase 1 
 8

   clinical trial, we believe that AVXS-101 also enables increased motor function and enhances survival. AVXS-101 contains the four elements that we believe are necessary for optimal delivery and function. 
   Components of AVXS-101 
 


 A recombinant AAV9 capsid
shell:  a non-replicating adeno-associated virus capsid to deliver a functional copy of a human SMN gene to the patient's own cells without modifying the existing DNA
of the patient. Unlike many other capsids, the AAV9 capsid utilized in AVXS-101
crosses the blood-brain barrier, a tight protective barrier which regulates the passage of substances between the bloodstream and the brain, and into the spinal cord, thus allowing the option for
intravenous administration. In addition, AAV9 has been observed in preclinical studies to efficiently target motor neuron cells when delivered via either intrathecal or intravenous administration. In
AVXS-101, the DNA contained within the capsid shell is engineered to contain the other three critical elements of AVXS-101, with the removal of the viral DNA, which leads to a lack of pathogenicity
and inability of the AAV9 virus to replicate in the patient's existing DNA. 
 A human SMNtransgene:  a stable, functioning SMN gene that is introduced into the
cell's nucleus. 
 Self-complementary DNA
technology:  the human SMN transgene is introduced as a self-complementary double-stranded
molecule. The inclusion of this technology enables rapid onset of effect. Typically, a single-stranded AAV vector must wait for cell-mediated synthesis of its complementary DNA strand to form the
double-stranded DNA unit that is required for DNA replication and subsequent protein synthesis. The self-complementary modification overcomes this rate-limiting step of cell-mediated second-strand
synthesis, as the two complementary halves of the scAAV genomes will associate with each other to form the required double-stranded DNA unit. 
 A continuous promoter:  this agent
activates the transgene and is designed to allow for continuous and sustained SMN gene expression. The cytomegalovirus enhanced chicken beta-actin
hybrid promoter that we utilize is a constitutive, or "always on" promoter that has been observed to increase transgene expression from AAV vectors compared to other promoters.

  Clinical Development of AVXS-101 
         We are currently developing AVXS-101 for the treatment of SMA Type 1 through intravenous administration. In April 2014, an open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical trial of AVXS-101 in patients with SMA Type 1 was initiated as an investigator-sponsored trial at NCH under an investigational new drug application, or IND, held by Dr. Jerry Mendell, the principal investigator at NCH. We completed the transfer of the IND to AveXis in November 2015. The trial design allows for the enrollment of up to 15 patients across a maximum of three dosing cohorts. Key inclusion criteria included the presence of typical clinical symptoms before 6 months of age, SMA Type 1 patients with bi-allelic  SMN1 gene deletions or mutations (all patients in the trial had bi-allelic deletions) and with two copies of the  SMN2 backup gene as confirmed by genetic testing in an independent laboratory. Confirmed absence of the Exon 7 genetic modifier (c.859G>C) was made through the laboratory of Dr. Tom Prior, the scientist who described the impact of this mutation on clinical phenotype. Furthermore, all patients were re-tested at an independent laboratory to re-confirm all genetic results. Additionally, patients must have been no older than nine months of age (for the first nine patients) and six months of age (for the last six patients) at the time of vector infusion. 
         The primary outcome measure of our Phase 1 clinical trial was safety and tolerability. The key efficacy measures were defined as the time from birth to an "event," which was defined as either death or at least 16 hours per day of required ventilation support for breathing for 14 consecutive days in the absence of acute reversible illness or perioperatively, and video confirmed achievement of ability to sit unassisted. We also assessed several exploratory objective measures in the clinical trial. These exploratory measures were included to assess additional testing protocols on patients in an effort to identify objective testing criteria for measuring the results of the therapy. These exploratory tests included administering a standard motor milestone development survey and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND), the need for pulmonary and feeding support, evaluation of swallowing function, compound motor action potentials testing (CMAP), motor unit number estimation testing (MUNE), non-invasive electrical impedance myography testing (EIM) and "ability captured through interactive video evaluation-mini" testing (ACTIVE-mini). 
         Once a patient met the screening criteria for the clinical trial, the patient received a one-time dosage of AVXS-101, by intravenous injection over a one-hour period. The patient remained at NCH for 48 hours after dosing for monitoring, and then was discharged. For one month after dosing, weekly follow-up evaluations were conducted. After the first month, additional monthly evaluations were conducted for the first 12 months followed by quarterly evaluations for the remaining 12 months. 
   Clinical Results 
         We have fully enrolled our Phase 1 trial, having dosed a total of 15 patients in the trial. The first cohort, which completed dosing in September 2014, consisted of three infants who received a dose of AVXS-101 administered at the low dose, based on the patient's weight. The second cohort, which completed dosing in December 2015, consisted of 12 infants who received the proposed therapeutic dose of AVXS-101. 
         As of January 20, 2017, all 15 patients (100%) in the trial reached 13.6 months of age without experiencing an "event," described as death or at least 16 hours per day of required ventilation support for breathing for 14 consecutive days in the absence of acute reversible illness or perioperatively. Nine patients who had reached 20 months of age at January 20, 2017 were event-free (three in the low-dose cohort and six in the proposed therapeutic dose cohort). All 15 patients experienced improvement from baseline in motor skills measured by their CHOP INTEND scores and such improvement appeared to be dose-dependent. As of January 20, 2017, we have observed AVXS-101 to be generally well-tolerated. We will conduct a follow-up safety analysis when the last patient enrolled in the trial reaches 24 months post-dose.

           As of January 20, 2017, all patients in the proposed therapeutic dose-cohort were event-free. The median age at last follow-up for the proposed therapeutic dose-cohort is 20.2 months, with the oldest patient at 31.1 months of age. The median age at last follow-up for the low-dose cohort is 30.8 months, which reflects the age of two patients at their final trial visit and the age of one patient at a pulmonary event. As previously reported, one patient in the low-dose cohort, had a pulmonary event in the third quarter of 2016 at the age of 28.8 months. The patient had increased use of bi-level positive airway pressure, or BiPAP, in advance of surgery related to hypersalivation, a condition experienced by some SMA patients; the event was determined upon independent review to represent progression of disease and not to be related to the use of AVXS-101. This patient completed the final trial visit in September 2016 and as of that time point, BiPAP use was below the 16 hours per day usage that defines the threshold for the survival endpoint. The median age at last follow-up for all 15 patients is 23.1 months, which reflects the age of four patients at their final trial visits and the age of one patient at a pulmonary event. Although the results of the Finkel 2014 Study were not pre-specified as a comparator for our trial, we believe that this compilation of data from patients with SMA Type 1 provides a useful context to consider the results of our trial to date. This peer-reviewed publication reported that 25% and 8% of patients with SMA Type 1 were event-free at 13.6 and 20.0 months of age, respectively. The lethality of the disease is further supported by the recent NeuroNEXT Study, which indicated a median time to death or tracheostomy for ventilation support for breathing SMA Type 1 patients from birth of eight months. The following figure shows survival data of all 15 patients enrolled in the clinical trial through January 20, 2017. 
 
        The CHOP INTEND test is designed to evaluate the motor skills of patients with SMA Type 1 by testing 16 items, which measure the movement of various body segments. The Finkel 2014 Study reported that patients with SMA Type 1 have an average annual decrease of 1.27 points in their CHOP INTEND score. The NeuroNEXT Study indicated a mean decline of 10.5 points in CHOP INTEND scores over a one-year period in untreated SMA Type 1 patients, highlighting the rapid loss of motor function occurring early in the disease course. All 15 patients enrolled in our Phase 1 trial experienced improvement from baseline in motor skills measured by their CHOP INTEND scores and such improvement appeared to be dose-dependent. As of January 20, 2017, we observed mean increases from baseline in CHOP INTEND scores of 7.7 points in the low-dose cohort and 24.7 points in the proposed therapeutic-dose cohort, reflecting improvement in motor function. In the proposed therapeutic-dose cohort, we observed mean increases in CHOP INTEND scores from baseline of 9.8 points one month after gene therapy and 15.4 points at three months following therapy. At the most recent evaluations prior to January 20, 2017, 11 out of 12 patients (92%), 10 out of 12 
 11

   patients (83%), and two out of 12 patients (17%) in the proposed therapeutic-dose cohort have achieved CHOP INTEND scores of at least 40 points, 50 points or 60 points, respectively. Two patients who have achieved CHOP INTEND scores of at least 60 points, which is considered to be normal, achieved the maximum CHOP INTEND score of 64. Based on our observations to date, we believe that increases in CHOP INTEND motor assessments appear to be age, baseline CHOP INTEND score and dose-dependent. We believe that there may be a dose response, based on our observation of CHOP INTEND scores of patients receiving the proposed therapeutic dose as compared to patients receiving the low dose because, as a group, the patients receiving the proposed therapeutic dose appear to be demonstrating a larger average CHOP INTEND score increase. 
         Patients with SMA Type 1 enter the trial at different ages, stages of disease progression and levels of motor function that can result in significant variability in baseline CHOP INTEND scores from patient to patient. Additionally, month-to-month variability in CHOP INTEND scores can be influenced by factors that are not related to study treatment. Examples of these factors include upper respiratory tract infections and fractured limbs, which may preclude the testing of some elements of the CHOP INTEND assessment. Our observations are consistent with the Finkel 2014 Study in which baseline CHOP INTEND scores also demonstrated significant variability. While the improvements seen with AVXS-101 in the proposed therapeutic dose cohort have never been observed in the natural history population, we believe observing change in CHOP INTEND scores over time is beneficial. 
         The natural history of SMA Type 1 is marked by the inability to achieve or maintain developmental motor milestones. An independent, peer-reviewed natural history study of developmental milestones in SMA Type 1 published in Neuromuscular Disorders in 2016, or the De Sanctis 2016 Study, reported that prolongation of survival with supportive care does not impact achievement of motor milestones. As observed in the De Sanctis 2016 Study, a child with SMA Type 1 with symptom onset prior to six months of age will not reach any major milestones such as sitting, crawling, standing and walking, and the highest milestone achieved is seen in the infant's first visit followed by a rapid decline. In contrast, as of January 20, 2017, patients in the proposed therapeutic-dose cohort consistently achieved and maintained key developmental motor milestones. As of January 20, 2017, 11 of 12 patients (92%) in the proposed therapeutic-dose cohort achieved head control, nine of 12 patients (75%) could roll a minimum of 180 degrees from back to both left and right, and 11 of 12 patients (92%) could sit with assistance. For the end-of-study assessment, we evaluated three validated and well-established measures of sitting unassisted for periods of increasing duration. Nine of 12 patients (75%) could sit unassisted for at least five seconds seven of 12 patients (58%) could sit unassisted for at least 10 seconds and five of 12 patients (42%) could sit unassisted for 30 seconds or more. Two patients could walk independently and each had achieved earlier and important developmental milestones such as standing with support, standing alone and walking with 
 12

   support. These milestone achievements were assessed and adjudicated by an independent, third-party reviewer using video evidence. The results of this process are included in the chart below.

         The primary outcome measure for our Phase 1 trial of AVXS-101 was safety. As of January 20, 2017, a total of 52 serious adverse events, or SAEs, were observed in 12 patients. Of these 52 SAEs, there were two treatment-related SAEs in two patients. There were also three treatment-related non-serious adverse events reported in two patients. All five treatment-related SAEs and AEs were clinically asymptomatic liver function enzyme, or LFE, elevations. 
         The treatment-related SAEs consisted of two patients that experienced elevated LFEs, which were each assessed as a Grade 4 event under the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events on the basis of laboratory values. We observed the first of these treatment-related SAEs in the first patient dosed with AVXS-101 in our Phase 1 clinical trial. After the onset of elevated LFEs, this patient was given a prednisolone regimen starting at 2 mg/kg daily and tapering off over time as LFEs returned to normal. After the first patient, we revised our clinical protocol to include pre-treatment with prednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day starting one day prior to the gene transfer in order to mitigate the T-cell immune response against AAV9 and the corresponding increase in LFEs. As of January 20, 2017, following this protocol change, out of the remaining 14 patients in our Phase 1 clinical trial, 11 patients had no reported adverse events related to elevations in LFEs, two patients had Grade 1 or 2 elevation in LFEs, and one patient experienced a Grade 4 elevation in LFE on the basis of laboratory values. We observed that this Grade 4 LFE patient had a concomitant viral infection and required additional prednisolone therapy until the LFEs returned to the normal range. We believe that the pretreatment with prednisolone has generally been effective in reducing the incidence and degree of elevated LFEs. As of January 20, 2017, all AEs and SAEs related to elevated LFEs were isolated elevations in serum transaminases, clinically asymptomatic and resolved with prednisolone treatment. There were no elevations in total bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase or alkaline phosphatase and Hy's law was not met. 
 13

           Based on the 15 patients dosed as of January 20, 2017, we observed AVXS-101 to be generally well-tolerated. As previously reported, a total of five adverse events, or AEs, in four patients were deemed treatment-related. Of these, two were SAEs experienced by two patients, and three were non-serious AEs experienced by two patients. All consisted of clinically asymptomatic liver enzyme elevations and were resolved with prednisolone treatment. There were no clinically significant elevations of gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin and, as such, Hy's Law was not met. Other non-treatment related AEs were expected and were associated with SMA. A cumulative total of 256 AEs (5 treatment-related AEs and 251 non-treatment related AEs) were reported as of January 20, 2017, following monitoring and source verification. Of these, 52 were determined to be SAEs and 204 were non-serious AEs. There were 65 new AEs reported after September 15, 2016, of which 10 were SAEs in three patients and were associated with SMA. 
   Preclinical Studies 
         Preliminary preclinical proof of concept and safety and tolerability studies of the intravenous delivery method were conducted at NCH and in conjunction with the Mannheimer Foundation for non-human primate studies. In a mouse model of SMA Type 1, it was observed that a single intravenous injection of AVXS-101 in mice improved body weight and motor functions, while also extending the median lifespan of the treated mice from 14 days to greater than 250 days with 30% of patients surviving over 400 days, compared to untreated mice, in a dose-responsive manner. In these studies, a minimally effective dosage was determined to be 6.7 × 10e13 vg/kg which increased median lifespan to 28 days. Escalating the dosage to 2.0 × 10e14 vg/kg increased the median lifespan of the SMA mouse model greater than 250 days. Further increasing the dosage to 3.3 × 10e14vg/kg also resulted in the SMA mouse model to have a median lifespan greater than 250 days. The 2.0 × 10e14 vg/kg and 3.3 × 10e14 vg/kg dosages appeared to be indistinguishable, with animals showing normal motor function.. In a preclinical study of non-human primates, it was observed that a single intravenous injection of AVXS-101 led to sustained human  SMN transgene expression in the spinal cord as well as in multiple organs and muscles, when evaluated 24 weeks after injection of AVXS-101. AVXS-101 has also been studied in multiple safety and tolerability studies in mice and non-human primates and no evidence of toxicity was observed for up to 24 weeks after injection of AVXS-101. 
         In addition, preliminary preclinical proof of concept (efficacy and safety) studies of the intrathecal delivery method were conducted at NCH. It was observed that in mice with SMA Type 1, a single intrathecal injection of AVXS-101 at a maximum dosage level of 3.3 × 1013 vg/kg, which was 10 times lower than the intravenous dose of 3.3 × 1014 vg/kg, improved body weight and motor functions, and most notably extended the median lifespan from 18 days to 282 days, with one-third of the mice surviving past 400 days. In the SMA mouse model, it was observed that a single intrathecal injection of scAAV9 containing a green fluorescent protein targeted between 21% to 41% and 46% to 72% of motor neurons in the spinal cord at the lowest dosage level and the highest dosage level, respectively. In non-human primates, it was observed that a single intrathecal injection of scAAV9 containing green fluorescent protein at a dose of 1.0 × 1013 vg/kg targeted 29%, 53% and 73% of cervical, thoracic and lumbar motor neurons, respectively. With tilting for ten minutes in the Trendelenburg position, such targeting increased to 55%, 62% and 80% of cervical, thoracic and lumbar motor neurons, respectively. In swine, NCH and collaborators at Ohio State University designed a small hairpin RNA that targeted porcine SMN and left human SMN intact, which reduced expression of porcine SMN. It was observed that the administration of AVXS-101 resulted in robust production of human SMN protein and significant increases in motor function. When delivered prior to the onset of motor function decline, AVXS-101 prevented the majority of SMA symptoms, demonstrated by motor function testing as well as electrophysiological evaluation. When delivered at the onset of SMA symptoms, AVXS-101 halted further progression and there were improvements in motor function as well as electrophysiological evaluation of motor units.

     Future SMA Type 1 Clinical Development 
         Based on the data observed from our Phase 1 clinical trial, we engaged in discussions with the FDA during the third quarter of 2016 to discuss the next steps in our AVXS-101 development plan for SMA Type 1. Based on the results of our September 30, 2016 Type B meeting with the FDA, we announced that our planned U.S. pivotal trial of AVXS-101 for the treatment of SMA Type 1 will reflect a single-arm design, using natural history of the disease as a comparator, and enroll approximately 20 patients. We anticipate that we will conduct a Type B meeting with the FDA on May 1, 2017 regarding CMC, and, pending the outcome from this meeting, we intend to initiate this pivotal trial in the United States during the first half of 2017 and an additional pivotal trial (single arm, historical control) in Europe following written Scientific Advice from EMA during the second half of 2017. 
 Future Applications and Opportunities 
         Based on preclinical data and our preliminary clinical observations to date in patients with SMA Type 1, we believe AVXS-101 may also have utility in other types of SMA, which result from the same genetic defect as SMA Type 1 as it addresses the root cause of the disease. We are currently evaluating preclinical data for the potential expansion of AVXS-101 into SMA Types 2, and possibly 3, via the intrathecal route of administration. Pending the outcome of our planned Type B CMC meeting with the FDA on May 1, 2017, we intend to initiate a Phase 1 safety and dosing escalation study of AVXS-101 via intrathecal delivery in patients with SMA Type 2 in the second quarter of 2017. 
         In addition to our programs in SMA, we also intend to identify, acquire, develop and commercialize novel product candidates for the treatment of other rare and life-threatening neurological genetic diseases that we believe can be treated with gene therapy. 
   Manufacturing 
         The clinical drug supply of AVXS-101 for our Phase 1 clinical trial was manufactured at NCH, which is considered a cGMP compliant facility. We manufacture AVXS-101 using adherent human embryonic kidney, or HEK, 293 cells. HEK293 cells have been used successfully to manufacture numerous other gene therapy candidates that have been tested or are currently being tested in other clinical trials to date. 
         As we further optimize and scale our manufacturing of AVXS-101 to meet our expected needs for further clinical trials and potential U.S. commercial demand, we have completed the technology transfer of AVXS-101 SAFC Carlsbad, Inc., or SAFC, and other to third parties with cGMP manufacturing capabilities. Based on independent quality assurance audits, we believe that SAFC and our other third party suppliers meet cGMP and European regulatory compliance requirements. We believe that our external and internal supply network will have sufficient capacity to meet demand for AVXS-101 for our upcoming clinical trials. We continue to work with third parties in order to evaluate and develop manufacturing process improvements that may increase the productivity and efficiency of our manufacturing process. 
         In parallel with the technology transfer and process development work with multiple third parties, we are continuing the process of establishing our own commercial scale cGMP-compliant manufacturing facility to enhance supply chain control, increase supply capacity for clinical trials, and ensure commercial demand is met in the event that AVXS-101 receives marketing approval. 
         Based on emerging data from our intended commercial process development work and ongoing discussions with the FDA, in December 2016 we announced our strategic decision to use product from the intended commercial process in all future studies of AVXS-101, including our planned SMA Type 2 trial.

     Competition 
         The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. In particular, the field of gene therapy is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face substantial competition from many different sources, such as large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions. 
         At this time, there is one FDA-approved, and no EMA-approved, treatment for SMA. There are currently no treatments approved by the FDA for SMA that specifically address the underlying cause of the disease, the genetic defect in the SMN1 gene. The standard of care for patients with SMA Type 1 has been generally limited to palliative therapies, including life-long respiratory care, ventilator support, nutritional care, orthopedic care and physical therapy; however, in December 2016, an alternative approach for the treatment of SMA called alternative splicing, which seeks to achieve more efficient production of full-length SMN protein from the SMN2 gene, SPINRAZATM (nusinersen) received FDA approval and was subsequently launched in the United States. In addition, a number of companies are developing drug candidates for SMA. We are aware of other companies exploring gene therapy treatments in preclinical development, including Biogen, Voyager Therapeutics, Inc. and Généthon. In addition to a gene therapy-based solution, alternative approaches in clinical development for the treatment of SMA include alternative splicing and neuroprotection technologies:


Alternative splicing seeks to increase production of full-length SMN protein from the SMN2 backup gene. Companies utilizing
this approach include Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which, together with its licensee Biogen in December
2016, received FDA approval for their product SPINRAZA (nusinersen) under Priority Review for the treatment of SMA in pediatric and adult patients and subsequently launched the product,
as noted above. Additionally, Roche Holding Ltd is conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial in SMA Type 1, and Novartis Corporation is conducting Phase 2 clinical trials for SMA
Type 1 patients in the EU. 
Neuroprotectants seek to mitigate the loss of motor neurons. Trophos SA, which has been
acquired by Roche Holding Ltd, has completed its Phase 3 clinical trial of its lead neuroprotectant product candidate, Olesoxime (TRO19622), in patients between the ages of three and 25
with SMA Types 2 and 3. 
Other approaches seek to improve muscle function and performance in SMA via additional
mechanisms. Cytokinetics, in collaboration with Astellas, is conducting a Phase 2 trial of CK-2127107 (CK-107), a skeletal troponin activator, in patients with SMA Types 2, 3 or 4 who
are 12 years and older. 

 Intellectual Property 
         We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We intend to seek, maintain and defend our patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy. Additionally, we intend to rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity and market exclusivity as well as patent term extensions, where available. 
         Our future commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce licensed patent rights, and, if sought and obtained in the future, any patent rights we may own; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without 
 16

   infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our current product candidate and any future product candidates may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to our licensed intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will issue with respect to any of the pending patent applications to which we license rights. With respect to any patent applications that we or our licensors may file in the future, if any, we cannot be sure that any such applications will issue or, if issued, that such applications will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidate and methods of manufacturing the same, or otherwise provide any competitive advantage. Even with respect to issued patents that we currently license, we cannot be certain that any such patents will provide any competitive advantage. See "Risk factorsRisks related to our intellectual property" for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property. 
         We have licensed certain patents and patent applications and we have licensed or otherwise possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to AVXS-101, our product candidate that uses the AAV9 capsid. We believe that the patents and patent applications we have in-licensed include claims that, if issued, would cover AVXS-101 and that the latest to expire of such currently in-licensed patent rights is a patent application owned by NCH and pending only in the United States that, if issued, would expire in 2029. Our proprietary, in-licensed intellectual property, including patent and non-patent intellectual property, generally is directed to AAV9 vectors, methods of treatment of clinical indications important for our development programs and processes to manufacture and purify AVXS-101. We are heavily dependent on the patented or proprietary technologies that we license from third parties. We anticipate that we will require additional licenses to third party intellectual property rights relating to our development programs in the future, including from NCH, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 
   Licensed Patents and Patent Applications 
         We license patents and patent applications from NCH, ReGenX and AskBio as described below. We also anticipate that additional patent or other intellectual property licenses, which we do not hold today, will likely be required for our commercial use of AVXS-101, including use by intravenous and/or intrathecal injection, and our manufacturing processes. Moreover, additional licenses which we do not hold today will be required to the extent we seek to develop additional product candidates in the future. 
 Trade Secrets 
         In addition to patents and licenses, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, and obtain and maintain ownership of certain technologies, in part, through confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how, as well as that of our licensees, including by implementing measures intended to maintain the physical security of research facilities and the physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. 
 Our Collaboration and License Agreements 
   Strategic Collaborators and Relationships 
         An important factor to our success is our strategic partnerships and relationships. Our key research collaborators are NCH and The Ohio State University College of Medicine. 
 17

     Nationwide Children's Hospital 
         In October 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with NCH, which we amended and restated in its entirety in January 2016, or the NCH License. Pursuant to the NCH License, NCH granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent rights to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import any products covered by the NCH License, or NCH licensed products, and a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain technical information to develop and manufacture the NCH licensed products, in the field of therapies and treatments of SMA. The patent rights exclusively in-licensed from NCH and relevant to our contemplated SMA product are a currently pending patent application being pursued only in the United States. The patent application claims AVXS-101 as a composition of matter and its use in treating SMA. If a patent issues from this patent application, it will expire in 2029. We have the right to subcontract the manufacturing of products using the licensed rights, such as AVXS-101. We also have the right to sublicense the licensed technology to third parties through multiple tiers. 
         Pursuant to the NCH License, NCH filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, for AVXS-101 for the treatment of SMA Type 1. Under the NCH License, we received an option to elect to become the sponsor of the IND. Such option could be exercised on or after October 14, 2015. On October 14, 2015, we exercised the option and, as of November 6, 2015, we became the sponsor of the IND. However, NCH has reversionary rights in the case of an act or omission constituting negligence or willful misconduct with respect to our control of the IND that has or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the clinical trials conducted under the IND and such act or omission has not been cured within a certain period of time following receipt of written notice and demand from NCH. 
         The NCH License sets forth a development plan for our development of the licensed technology to make and sell NCH licensed products, including AVXS-101 for the treatment of SMA Type 1, throughout the world. We are required to achieve certain development milestones, including a specified minimum funding obligation of $9.4 million for the development of NCH licensed products by 2021, which requirement NCH acknowledged we had fulfilled in whole as of the date of the amendment and restatement of the NCH License. We are also required, if commercially reasonable, to market NCH licensed products after regulatory approval, satisfy the market demand for such products in those countries in which we have obtained regulatory approval where it is commercially reasonable to do so and continue to develop additional NCH licensed products within the field. In the event we fail to comply with such obligations, subject to certain conditions, NCH has the right to either terminate the NCH License or convert our license into a non-exclusive license with respect to the applicable NCH licensed product in the applicable country. In addition, we are responsible for all clinical trial costs that are not covered by grants or certain other sources. 
         In consideration for license rights granted to us, we initially issued NCH and The Ohio State University, or OSU, 331,053 shares of our common stock. Until May 2015, when we had reached a certain stipulated market capitalization, we were obligated to issue additional shares to NCH and OSU from time to time so that their aggregate ownership represented 3% (which percentage will be prorated downward if either NCH or OSU transfer any of such shares) of our issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully-diluted basis. 
         Following the first commercial sale of a NCH licensed product, we must begin paying NCH an aggregate low-single digit royalty on net sales of NCH licensed products by us, our affiliates and sublicensees during the term of the NCH License, with annual minimum royalties, in dollar amounts ranging from low five digits to low six digits, that increase over time. If we unsuccessfully challenge any of the licensed patents, the royalty rate increases from low single digits to mid-single digits. These royalty rates are further subject to reduction in the event we have to license third-party patents to exploit the licensed technology. 
 18

           With certain exceptions, we are required to make certain development milestone based payments to NCH. In addition, we must also pay NCH a portion of sublicensing revenue received from our sublicense of the rights to licensed technology at percentages between low-double digits and low-teens. 
         We do not have the right to control prosecution of the in-licensed patent rights, however NCH shall consult with us on material matters regarding the prosecution of such patent rights, and NCH has the first right to enforce any patents issuing from the in-licensed patent rights and if NCH does not enforce the rights within a certain time frame, then we have the right to enforce. In addition, our rights under the NCH License are not assignable without the prior written consent of NCH, except to our affiliates, subsidiaries or any successor in interest in connection with a merger, acquisition, consolidation or sale, provided that our assignee assumes our obligations under the NCH License in writing. 
         Unless terminated earlier, the agreement will expire on a NCH licensed product-by-NCH licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the royalty term for such NCH licensed product in such country. The royalty term will expire on the later of (i) the date on which the last relevant patent underlying the relevant NCH licensed product expires or (ii) ten years from the first commercial sale of NCH licensed product in such country. Upon expiration of the agreement with respect to a particular NCH licensed product in a particular country, the license to us will survive and as a fully-paid up license. The NCH License may be terminated prior to its expiration:
 

 By us at any time by providing six months' prior written notice to NCH; 
 By either party upon the other party's material breach of the NCH License that is not cured within 90 days after receiving written
notice of such breach, except in certain cases in which we may request a longer cure period; 
 By NCH in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency or certain similar occurrences; or 
 By NCH if we or any of our affiliates bring any action or proceeding against NCH, other than a suit brought in response to any suit brought by
NCH. 

         Certain accrued payments that we are required to make to NCH will become due in the event of termination as specified in the agreement. As of December 31, 2016, we have reimbursed NCH $0.6 million and incurred $9.3 million in aggregate development costs. 
   The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital 
         In October 2013, we entered into a clinical trials research agreement with the Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, or the Research Institute. This agreement governs our preclinical and clinical trials conducted at NCH by Dr. Mendell. 
         Under the NCH license agreement, we had the right to elect to become the sponsor of the IND subject to certain reversionary rights of the Research Institute. On October 14, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the NCH License with NCH permitting us to submit to the FDA for the transfer of the IND and associated regulatory filing to us and for us to become the sponsor of such IND. Contemporaneous with the execution of this amendment, we submitted the requisite documents to the FDA to initiate the transfer process. On November 6, 2015, the FDA approved our sponsorship of the IND. We are responsible for all budgeted clinical trial costs that are not covered by grants or certain other sources. All data and information generated under the agreement is subject to our agreements with NCH. 
 19

           Unless terminated earlier, the agreement expires upon the completion of the study. The agreement may be terminated prior to its expiration:
 

 By either party upon the other party's breach of the agreement that is not cured within 60 days after receiving written notice of such
breach; or 
 By us at any time in the event we elect to become the sponsor of the IND. 

         Our clinical trial research agreement with the Research Institute also contains obligations for us to indemnify the Research Institute and its affiliates against certain losses and for us to maintain certain insurance, as well as mutual confidentiality obligations. 
   REGENXBIO 
         In March 2014, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with ReGenX Biosciences, LLC, or ReGenX, predecessor to REGENXBIO Inc., under certain patents and patent applications owned by the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania and licensed to ReGenX, for the development and commercialization of products to treat spinal muscular atrophy using AAV9, or the ReGenX License. Under the ReGenX License, ReGenX granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under the licensed patent rights to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale any products covered by the ReGenX License, or ReGenX licensed products, in the field of the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy in humans by  in vivo gene therapy using AAV9 subject to certain rights reserved by ReGenX and its licensors. The patent rights exclusively in-licensed include an issued United States patent, which expires September 2024, not including 473 days of patent term adjustment (as well as issued patents in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and China, which expire in 2024). These issued patents claim AAV9 vectors and viruses having an AAV9 capsid, as well as methods of use. In addition, the in-licensed patent rights include pending patent applications in the United States, Canada, China, Europe and Japan, that if issued as patents, will expire in 2024. These pending applications claim AAV9 vectors and viruses having an AAV9 capsid, as well as its use in treatment. We have the right to sublicense the licensed technology to third parties subject to certain conditions as specified in the ReGenX License. Under the ReGenX License we grant a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sublicenseable, irrevocable, perpetual license back to ReGenX to (a) use any patentable modifications and improvements to the licensed technology that we or our affiliates or sublicensees develop, or licensed back improvements, and (b) to practice the licensed back improvements in connection with AAV9 outside of our field of use. 
         Under the terms of the ReGenX License, we paid or are required to pay:
 

 an initial fee of $2.0 million; 
 an annual maintenance fee; 
 up to $12.25 million in milestone fees for all ReGenX licensed products; 
 mid-single digit to teen royalty percentages on net sales of ReGenX licensed products, subject to reduction in specified circumstances; and 
 lower mid-double digit percentages of any sublicense fees we receive from sublicensees for the licensed intellectual property rights. 

         As of December 31, 2016, we have paid $2.4 million under the ReGenX License, which includes $0.3 million in aggregate milestone payments. 
         The ReGenX License requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, commercialize, market, promote and sell products utilizing the licensed patent rights in our field of use. We are obligated to achieve certain development milestones with respect to the licensed disease indication. We do not have the right to control prosecution of the in-licensed patent applications, and 
 20

   our rights to enforce the in-licensed patents are subject to certain limitations. In addition, our rights under the ReGenX License are not assignable without the prior written consent of ReGenX. 
         Our license agreement with ReGenX will expire upon the expiration, lapse, abandonment or invalidation of the last claim of the licensed intellectual property to expire, lapse or become abandoned or unenforceable in all the countries of the world. We have the right to terminate the ReGenX License upon a specified period of prior written notice. ReGenX may terminate the ReGenX License if we or our affiliates become insolvent, if we are greater than a specified number of days late in paying money due under the ReGenX License, or, effective immediately, if we or our affiliates, or sublicensees commence any action against ReGenX or its licensors to declare or render any claim of the licensed patent rights invalid or unenforceable. Either party may terminate the ReGenX License for material breach if such breach is not cured within a specified number of days. Upon termination of the agreement, other than for ReGenX's material breach, we grant to ReGenX a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sublicenseable license under patentable modifications and improvements to any vector claimed by the licensed patents for use by ReGenX for the research, development and commercialization of products in any therapeutic indication. 
   Asklepios Biopharmaceutical, Inc. 
         In May 2015, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with Asklepios Biopharmaceutical, Inc., or the AskBio License. Pursuant to the license agreement, AskBio granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent rights and know-how owned or controlled by AskBio, including certain patent rights owned by the University of North Carolina and licensed to AskBio, and relating to its self-complementary DNA technology to develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, export and distribute any products covered by the AskBio License, or AskBio licensed products, for the treatment of SMA in humans. The in-licensed patent rights are issued patents in the United States, and in Canada and Europe. There are two in-licensed patent families. The first patent family expires in November 2019 worldwide. The second patent family includes three issued United States patents with expiry dates between May 2021 and August 2023. The foreign counterparts expire in 2021. The patents relate to self-complementary technology and include claims to viral particles based on such technology, methods of manufacturing such viral particles, and methods of use in treatment. We have the right to sublicense the licensed technology to third parties with AskBio's prior approval. We assign to AskBio all right, title and interest in and to defined improvements to the licensed technology that we make and all patent rights covering those improvements. In return, we receive a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sublicenseable, irrevocable, perpetual license to practice such improvements. 
         The AskBio License required us to pay AskBio a one-time upfront license fee of $1.0 million and an ongoing annual maintenance fee of $0.1 million each year during the term of the license agreement. We are also required to pay up to a total of $0.6 million in clinical development milestone payments and $9.0 million in sales based milestone payments. 
         Under the terms of the AskBio License, we are required to pay AskBio annual tiered royalties based on the aggregate net sales of AskBio licensed products on a field-by-field basis starting at percentages in the low-single digits and increasing to mid-single digits. The royalties are payable on a country-by-country basis until the last to expire of the valid claims within the licensed patents that cover the AskBio licensed product in such country. These royalty rates are subject to reductions in specified circumstances, including, in the event we exercise our option to make a specified one-time royalty option fee payment of $3.0 million to AskBio as further detailed in the AskBio License. We must also pay AskBio a low-double digit percentage of all consideration we receive from our sublicense of the licensed technology. 
 21

          
        We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, commercialize and sell AskBio licensed products for the treatment of SMA in humans throughout the term of the AskBio License. We do not have the right to control prosecution of the in-licensed patent applications, and AskBio has the sole right, but not the obligation, to enforce the in-licensed patents. In addition, our rights under the AskBio License are not assignable without the prior written consent of AskBio. 
         Unless terminated earlier, the AskBio License automatically expires on the date on which we no longer have any payment obligation under the AskBio License. The AskBio License may be terminated prior to its expiration:
 

 by us upon six months advance written notice to AskBio; 
 by either party upon the other party's breach of the AskBio License that is not cured within the specified cure period based on the nature of
such breach; 
 by either party in the event of either party's bankruptcy, insolvency or certain similar occurrences; 
 by AskBio if, during a specified period of time and subject to certain conditions being met, we research, develop or commercialize an AAV-based
treatment for hemophilia or we undergo a change of control with, or are otherwise acquired by, a third party that conducts such activities; or 
 by AskBio if we bring any action or proceeding challenging the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents. 

         As of December 31, 2016, we have paid AskBio the $1.0 million upfront license fee and accrued $79,000 in annual maintenance fees. 
   Government Regulation and Product Approval 
         In the United States, the FDA regulates biologic products including gene therapy products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and regulations and guidance implementing these laws. The FDCA, PHSA and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biologic products. Applications to the FDA are required before conducting human clinical testing of biologic products. Additionally, each clinical trial protocol for a gene therapy product candidate is reviewed by the FDA and, in limited instances the National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, through its Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of biologic products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals. 
         Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Tissue and Advanced Therapies, or OTAT, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee, or the CTGTAC, to advise CBER on its reviews. CBER works closely with the NIH and the RAC, which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. Although the FDA has not yet approved any human gene therapy product for sale, it has provided guidance for the development of gene therapy products. This guidance includes a growing body of guidance documents on CMC, clinical investigations and 
 22

   other areas of gene therapy development, all of which are intended to facilitate the industry's development of gene therapy products. 
         Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
   U.S. Biologic Products Development Process 
         Our product candidate must be approved by the FDA before it may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:


 completion of preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies in accordance with the FDA's
current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 
 submission to the FDA of an application for an IND exemption, which allows human clinical trials to begin unless FDA objects within
30 days; 
 approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
 performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA's GCP regulations, and any additional requirements for
the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use; 
 preparation and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application ("BLA") for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of
safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
 review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; 
 satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product candidate is produced to
assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic product candidate's identity, safety, strength, quality, potency
and purity; 
 potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 
 payment of user fees and FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA. 

         Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, including a gene therapy product candidate, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 
 23

           Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually must complete some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
         If a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documents must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or the OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or the NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA. However, many companies and other institutions, not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines, voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the RAC that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC's decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public. 
         The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies. 
   Human Clinical Trials Under an IND 
         Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators which generally are physicians not employed by, or under, the control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to 
 24

   commence. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA's regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. 
         Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or their legal representative, reviews and approves the study protocol, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials involving recombinant DNA also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research that utilizes recombinant DNA at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 
         Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 

 Phase 1.  The biologic product candidate initially is introduced into
a small number of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness.
In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the
initial human testing is often conducted in patients. Phase 1 clinical trials of gene therapies are typically conducted in patients rather than healthy volunteers. 
 Phase 2.  The biologic product candidate is evaluated in a limited
patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage
tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
 Phase 3.  Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as
"pivotal" studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a biologic product. In
Phase 3 studies, the biologic product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites in adequate and
well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the potency and safety of the product for approval. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall
risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 

         Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. 
         During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. 
         Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for: serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other trials,  in vivo laboratory tests or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any 
 25

   unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. 
         The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the biologic product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
   Additional Regulation for Gene Therapy Clinical Trials 
         In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. 
         The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene therapy trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these trials. 
   Compliance with cGMP Requirements 
         Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA will not approve a BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specification. 
         Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 26

     U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
         The results of the preclinical tests and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product's CMC and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. 
         For gene therapies, selecting patients with applicable genetic defects is a necessary condition to effective treatment. For the therapy we are currently developing, we believe that diagnoses based on existing genetic tests developed and administered by laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, are sufficient to select appropriate patients and will be permitted by the FDA. 
         Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. The PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biologics and an annual establishment license fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication. 
         The FDA reviews a BLA within 60 days of submission to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In that event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth, substantive review of the BLA. 
         The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product candidate's identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product candidate. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
         Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. 
 27

           On the basis of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. 
         If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biologic product's safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
         The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs under the PDUFA. One such goal is to review standard BLAs in ten months after the FDA accepts the BLA for filing, and priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
   Orphan Drug Designation 
         Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a biologic product as an "orphan drug" if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a biologic product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
         If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or if the party holding the exclusivity fails to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the same indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan medicinal product status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits. For example, the European Union grants 10 years of product exclusivity for orphan medicinal products.

  Expedited Development and Review Programs 
         The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a biologic product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Biologic products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review. 
         Any product submitted to FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval. 
 

 Breakthrough therapy designation.  To qualify for the breakthrough therapy
program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate
substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives: intensive
guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and rolling review. 
 Accelerated approval.  Drug or biologic products studied for their safety
and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval
means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is
reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into
account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic
product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval
pre-approval of promotional materials. 

         Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
   Post-approval Requirements 
         Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biologic products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biologic products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA, together with a release protocol, showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots 
 29

   of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biologic products. 
         A sponsor also must comply with the FDA's advertising and promotion requirements, such as the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product's approved labeling (known as "off-label use"). Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
         Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal actions and adverse publicity. These actions could include refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, suspension or termination of a clinical trial by an IRB, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines or other monetary penalties, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare providers, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or other civil or criminal penalties. 
   U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
         Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of product candidates, some of a sponsor's U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. The patent term restoration period generally is one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biologic product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. Moreover, a given patent may only be extended once based on a single product. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. 
 Government Regulation Outside of the United States 
         In addition to regulations in the United States, sponsors are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of biologic products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
         Whether or not a sponsor obtains FDA approval for a product, a sponsor must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, much like the IND, prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a request for a Clinical Trial Authorization, or CTA, must be submitted to the competent regulatory authorities and 
 30

   the competent Ethics Committees in the European Union Member States in which the clinical trial takes place, much like FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA request is approved in accordance with the European Union and the European Union Member State's requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Access to the Priority Medicines, or PRIME, initiative is granted by the European Medicines Agency, to support the development and accelerate the review of new therapies to treat patients with unmet medical need. 
         The requirements and processes governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, as well as the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki (whichever provides the greater protection to the clinical trial participants). 
         Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, fines, suspension, variation or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
   Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations 
         Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and use of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors, existing or potential customers and referral sources, including healthcare providers, are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, and these laws and regulations may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which manufacturers conduct clinical research, market, sell and distribute the products for which they obtain marketing approval. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:


 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting,
receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, in exchange for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation
of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between
pharmaceutical manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, amended the intent requirement
of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation; 
 the federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, or the FCA, which prohibit, among other
things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a
false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, also may implicate the FCA. In
addition, the PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of
the federal civil False Claims Act. 
 the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which
payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or the
CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, certain other healthcare providers and 

 31

   

teaching
hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members; 


 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme
to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, which imposes
obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the transmission, security and privacy of protected health information by entities subject to HIPAA, such as health
plans, health care clearinghouses and healthcare providers, and their respective business associates that access protected health information; 
 The federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any
materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; and 
 state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or
services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance
guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources;
state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws
governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating
compliance efforts. 

         Violation of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations may result in penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, individual imprisonment, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if a person becomes subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Furthermore, efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly for manufacturers of branded prescription products. 
   Coverage and Reimbursement 
         Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of any product candidates for which regulatory approval for commercial sale is obtained will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities and health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this 
 32

   effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. 
         A payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. 
         Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. New metrics frequently are used as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price and actual acquisition cost. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, it may be necessary to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. 
         The marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
         In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements. 
   Health Reform 
         The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to 
 33

   limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing. 
         By way of example, in March 2010, the PPACA was signed into law, intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the healthcare industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the PPACA of importance to our business are:
 

 an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned
among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; 
 an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average
manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively; 
 a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled,
infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 
 extension of a manufacturer's Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care
organizations; 
 expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain
individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer's Medicaid rebate liability; 
 a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off
negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; 
 expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and 
 a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research,
along with funding for such research. 

         Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the PPACA. In January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Further, in January 2017, Congress adopted a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the PPACA. Following the passage of the Budget Resolution, in March 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced legislation known as the American Health Care Act, which, if enacted, would amend or repeal significant portions of the PPACA. Among other changes, the American Health Care Act would repeal the annual fee on certain brand prescription drugs and biologics imposed on manufacturers and importers, eliminate penalties on individuals and employers that fail to maintain or provide minimum essential coverage, and create refundable tax credits to assist individuals in buying health insurance. The American Health Care Act would also make significant changes to Medicaid by, among other things, making Medicaid expansion optional for states, repealing the requirement that state Medicaid plans provide the same essential health benefits that are required 
 34

   by plans available on the exchanges, modifying federal funding, including implementing a per capita cap on federal payments to states, and changing certain eligibility requirements. 
         Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the PPACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to certain providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additionally, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. 
         We expect that these initiatives, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs. 
   Additional Regulation 
         In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biologic, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other countries that impose similar obligations. 
 U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
         The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business abroad or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other foreign countries that impose similar obligations. 
 Employees 
         As of December 31, 2016, we had 70 full-time employees, nine of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 49 of whom are engaged in research and development activities and 21 of whom are engaged in business development, finance, information systems, facilities, human resources or administrative support. None of our employees is party to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
