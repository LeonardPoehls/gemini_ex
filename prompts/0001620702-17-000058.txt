Item 1. Business. 
Overview
TerraForm Global, Inc. and its subsidiaries (together, the "Company") is a globally diversified renewable energy company that owns long-term contracted solar and wind power plants. The Company's business objective is to own and operate a portfolio of renewable energy power plants and to pay cash dividends to our stockholders. The Company’s portfolio consists of solar and wind power plants located in Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, South Africa, Thailand and Uruguay with an aggregate net capacity (based on our share of economic ownership) of 919.0 MW as of May 31, 2017.
We were formed as a Delaware corporation under the name SunEdison Emerging Markets Growth and Yield, Inc. on September 12, 2014 as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of SunEdison, Inc. The name of the Company was changed from SunEdison Emerging Markets Growth and Yield, Inc. to SunEdison Emerging Markets Yield, Inc. on September 26, 2014. The name change from SunEdison Emerging Markets Yield, Inc. to TerraForm Global, Inc., became effective on April 1, 2015. Following our initial public offering (“IPO”) on August 5, 2015, TerraForm Global, Inc. became a holding company and its sole asset is a 64.8% equity interest in TerraForm Global, LLC (“Global LLC”) as of May 31, 2017. TerraForm Global, Inc. is the managing member of Global LLC, and operates, controls and consolidates the business affairs of Global LLC. Unless otherwise indicated or otherwise required by the context, references to “we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company” refer to TerraForm Global, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Our principal executive offices are located at 7550 Wisconsin Avenue, 9th Floor, Bethesda, Maryland 20814, and our telephone number is (240) 762-7700. Our website address is www.terraformglobal.com.
The diagram below is a summary depiction of our organizational structure as of May 31, 2017:

(1) Both SunEdison, Inc. and SunEdison Holdings Corporation are debtors in the SunEdison Bankruptcy. SunEdison’s economic interest is subject to certain limitations on distributions to holders of Class B units during the Subordination Period and the Distribution Forbearance Period (as described in Item 15. Note 19 - Related Parties).
(2) The economic interest of holders of Class A units, Class B units and, in turn, holders of shares of Class A common stock, is subject to the right of holders of the IDRs to receive a portion of distributions after certain distribution thresholds are met.
(3)IDRs represent a variable interest in distributions by Global LLC and therefore cannot be expressed as a fixed percentage interest. All of our IDRs are currently issued to SunEdison Holdings Corporation, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of SunEdison, Inc.
Our Business
Our primary business is to own and operate a portfolio of renewable energy power plants and to pay cash dividends to our stockholders. 
We have acquired a portfolio of long-term contracted clean power plants from SunEdison and unaffiliated third parties that have proven technologies, creditworthy counterparties, low operating risks and stable cash flows. We have focused on the solar and wind energy segments because we believe they are currently the fastest growing segments of the clean power generation industry globally. Solar and wind assets are also attractive because there is no associated fuel cost risk, the technologies have become highly reliable and assets have an expected life which can exceed 30 years. From time to time, we may selectively choose to acquire renewable energy projects before they have reached commercial operation if we believe there is greater value to the Company’s stockholders by owning the asset prior to commercial operation and if we believe that any risks to achieving commercial operation have been sufficiently mitigated.
On April 21, 2016, SunEdison and certain of its domestic and international subsidiaries voluntarily filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the “SunEdison Bankruptcy”). In anticipation of and in response to SunEdison’s financial and operating difficulties, which culminated in the SunEdison Bankruptcy, at the direction of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”), the Company has undertaken, and continues to undertake, a number of strategic initiatives to mitigate the adverse impacts of the SunEdison Bankruptcy on the Company. Focusing on governance, operations and business performance initiatives deemed especially critical because SunEdison provided all personnel and services to the Company (other than those operational services provided by third parties), these initiatives have included, among other things, developing continuity plans, establishing stand-alone information technology, accounting and other critical systems and infrastructure, directly hiring employees, and developing the ability to provide (or engaging third parties to provide) O&M and asset management services for the Company's wind and solar power plants.
As part of this overall strategic review process, the Company also initiated a process for the exploration and evaluation of potential strategic alternatives, including potential transactions to secure a new sponsor or sell the Company. As discussed under Item 1. Business - Recent Developments - Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement with Brookfield Asset Management Inc. below, this process resulted in the announcement by the Company on March 6, 2017, that the Company had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (“Brookfield”) pursuant to which a controlled subsidiary of Brookfield would acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests in the Company (the “Brookfield Transaction”). If the Brookfield Transaction is consummated, each issued and outstanding share of our Class A common stock (with certain exceptions) will be converted into the right to receive the per share cash merger consideration, we will no longer have public stockholders and our Class A common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Except as otherwise noted, the disclosures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 discuss our business and operations without considering the impact and consequences of the Brookfield Transaction and reflect the business strategy we expect to pursue in the event the Brookfield Transaction is not consummated.
7

We continue to focus on satisfying the conditions to the closing of the Brookfield Transaction under the Merger Agreement and executing our other near term plans and priorities, including:

• | focusing on the performance and efficiency of our existing portfolio of power plants;


• | mitigating, to the extent possible, the adverse impacts resulting from the SunEdison Bankruptcy, including ensuring the continuity of operation, maintenance and asset management of our power plants;


• | resolving our material pending litigation;


• | working with our project level lenders to cure, or obtain waivers or forbearance of, defaults that have arisen under certain of our project level debt financings as a result of the SunEdison Bankruptcy;


• | resolving the pending commitment to acquire three operating power plants from BioTherm (as defined below); and


• | seeking to optimize our portfolio and capital structure by financing or refinancing certain power plants and/or exiting certain markets or selling certain assets if we believe the opportunity would improve stockholder value.

If we are unable to successfully complete the Brookfield Transaction, it would be necessary for the Company to reevaluate its strategic alternatives. If such reevaluation does not result in the Company entering into an alternative transaction, we expect to pursue our long-term business, which is to own and operate our portfolio of renewable energy power plants, pursue growth opportunities and pay cash dividends to our stockholders.
Our Portfolio
Our portfolio consists of solar and wind power plants located in Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, South Africa, Thailand, and Uruguay with an aggregate net capacity (based on our share of economic ownership) of 919.0 MW as of May 31, 2017. These power plants generally have long-term Power Purchase Agreements (“PPAs”) with creditworthy counterparties. Our current portfolio has PPAs with a weighted average (based on net capacity according to share of economic ownership) remaining life of 17 years as of May 31, 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, solar energy represented 55%, 75% and 100% of our consolidated operating revenues, net for the respective periods, and wind energy represented 45% and 25% of our consolidated operating revenues, net for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Subject to market and other conditions, our long-term plan is to further expand and diversify our current portfolio by acquiring utility-scale and distributed assets located in our core markets and certain other jurisdictions, each of which we expect will also have a long-term PPA with a creditworthy counterparty. However, as discussed under Item 1. Business - Recent Developments - SunEdison Bankruptcy below, in connection with the Brookfield Transaction, we entered into a Settlement Agreement (as defined below) with SunEdison to resolve our outstanding intercompany claims and defenses in connection with the SunEdison Bankruptcy, and the Settlement Agreement has been approved by the bankruptcy court overseeing the SunEdison Bankruptcy. If the Settlement Agreement becomes effective, our existing rights to acquire certain projects from SunEdison will be terminated. Even if such rights are not terminated, as a result of the SunEdison Bankruptcy, we do not expect to acquire any additional projects from SunEdison. In addition, recent market conditions affecting companies in our sector generally have limited our ability to acquire and finance projects at attractive returns, so our ability to complete acquisitions on attractive terms or at all may be limited.

 (1) Nameplate capacity represents the maximum generating capacity at standard test conditions of a facility. Revenue in the financial statements is based on nameplate capacity with the exception of unconsolidated businesses. 
 (2) Net capacity represents the maximum generating capacity at standard test conditions of a power plant multiplied by either the Company’s percentage of economic ownership of that power plant after taking into account any redeemable preference shares and shareholder loans held by the Company or percentage of equity ownership of that power plant, as applicable. 
(3) Calculated as of May 31, 2017. The number represents a weighted average (based on net capacity based on share of economic ownership) of remaining duration.
 (4) The equity interests in Millenium and SE 25 that were not owned by the Company as of December 31, 2016 were transferred to the Company following the expiration of the equity lock up period in the applicable PPA in January and March 2017, respectively. In the case of SE 25, prior to the transfer of the equity interests to the Company, the Company received approximately 100% of the economic value of the power plant through the payment to the Company of interest and principal on bonds issued by the project company to the Company.

Recent Developments
Entry into a Definitive Merger Agreement with Brookfield Asset Management Inc.
On March 6, 2017, TerraForm Global, Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Orion US Holdings 1 L.P. (“Parent”), a Delaware limited partnership and an affiliate of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (“Brookfield”), and BRE GLBL Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into TerraForm Global, Inc. (the “Merger”), with TerraForm Global, Inc. surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. 
The proposed Merger was approved by the Board, following the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Conflicts Committee of the Board (the “Conflicts Committee”). Completion of the Merger is expected to occur, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions, in the second half of 2017.
As a result of the Merger, each share of Class A common stock of TerraForm Global, Inc., par value $0.01 per share (the “Class A Shares”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than Class A Shares that are (i) owned by TerraForm Global, Inc., Parent or any of their direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and not held on behalf of third parties, (ii) owned by stockholders who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or (iii) held by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is taxable as a corporation (the foregoing clauses (i) - (iii), collectively, the “Excluded Shares”)), will be converted into the right to receive per share Merger consideration equal to $5.10 per Class A Share in cash, without interest.
Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, SunEdison and certain of its affiliates executed and delivered a voting and support agreement with Brookfield and TerraForm Global, Inc. (the “Voting and Support Agreement”) pursuant to which SunEdison agreed to vote or cause to be voted any shares of common stock of TerraForm Global, Inc. held by it or any of its controlled affiliates in favor of the Merger and to take certain other actions to support the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Voting and Support Agreement was approved by the bankruptcy court overseeing the SunEdison Bankruptcy on June 7, 2017.
The Merger Agreement includes a non-waivable condition to closing that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement be approved by holders of a majority of the outstanding Class A Shares, excluding all Class A Shares held by SunEdison or any of its affiliates (“SunEdison Class A Shares”) and Parent or any of its affiliates.
Closing of the Merger also is subject to certain other conditions, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock of TerraForm Global, Inc. entitled to vote on the Merger and receipt of certain regulatory approvals. The entry by the bankruptcy court overseeing the SunEdison Bankruptcy of orders authorizing and approving the entry by SunEdison (and, if applicable, SunEdison’s debtor affiliates) into the Settlement Agreement, the Voting and Support Agreement and any other agreement entered into in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to which SunEdison or any other debtor will be a party (the “Bankruptcy Court Order”) is also a condition to the closing of the Merger. The bankruptcy court overseeing the SunEdison Bankruptcy entered the Bankruptcy Court Order on June 7, 2017 and this condition has been satisfied. In addition, Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger are subject to the requirement that certain litigation has been finally dismissed with prejudice or the settlement thereof has been submitted for court approval in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Parent pursuant to agreements or stipulations containing releases reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and all final approvals of courts or regulatory authorities required for the settlements and releases to become final, binding and enforceable; provided, however, that in no event will a settlement of certain claims made by Renova Energia, S.A. (“Renova”) include an aggregate payment by the Company of greater than $3,000,000 (net of any amounts funded directly or indirectly by insurance proceeds). In the event that this condition has not been satisfied when all other conditions to closing are satisfied (other than those that by their nature are satisfied or waived at closing), Parent and the Company have agreed to negotiate in good faith to adjust, or defer a portion of, the $5.10 in cash per Class A Share otherwise payable pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement so that this condition will be satisfied.
On May 26, 2017, TerraForm Global, Inc., TerraForm Global, LLC, TerraForm Global Brazil Holding B.V. and TERP GLBL Brasil I Participacoes Ltda. entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (the “Renova Settlement Agreement”) with Renova. The Renova Settlement Agreement resolves all disputes among the Company and Renova that are the subject of an ongoing arbitration proceeding in the Center for Arbitration and Mediation of the Chamber of Commerce Brazil-Canada (the “Renova Arbitration”). Concurrently with the execution of the Renova Settlement Agreement, TerraForm Global, Inc. and Parent entered into a letter agreement (the “Renova Letter Agreement”), pursuant to which Parent has agreed that upon the later to occur of (i) the effective time as described in the Renova Settlement Agreement and (ii) the closing of the 
10

share purchase contemplated by the PSA (as defined and described below), the condition to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger set forth in Section 7.2(c) (Litigation Settlement) of the Merger Agreement, solely with respect to Renova’s claims in the Renova Arbitration, has been satisfied and the aggregate payment made by the Company (net of any amounts funded directly or indirectly by insurance proceeds) under the Renova Settlement Agreement in connection with the settlement of Renova’s claims in the Renova Arbitration will be deemed to be zero. Also, concurrently with the execution of the Renova Settlement Agreement, Renova and Parent entered into a Purchase & Sale Agreement (the “PSA”) with respect to all of the shares of Class A common stock of TerraForm Global, Inc. owned by Renova (excluding the shares to be released from escrow to TerraForm Global, Inc. pursuant to the Renova Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the PSA, Parent has agreed to purchase 19,535,004 shares of Class A common stock of TerraForm Global, Inc. from Renova for a purchase price in cash of $4.75 per share, or $92,791,269 in the aggregate. The consummation of the share purchase contemplated by the PSA is subject to customary conditions to closing and is conditioned upon the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Renova Settlement Agreement described above, including the effectiveness of the mutual releases and release of the shares in escrow. 
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub has made customary representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement. The Company has also agreed to various agreements and covenants, including, among others, and subject to certain exceptions, to conduct its business in the ordinary course between execution of the Merger Agreement and closing of the Merger and not to engage in certain specified types of transactions during such period.
In addition, the Company is subject to a “no change of recommendation” restriction limiting its ability to change its recommendation in respect of the Merger except as permitted by the Merger Agreement and a “no shop” restriction on its ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties and to provide information to, and engage in discussions with, third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals.
The Merger Agreement contains specified termination rights, including the right for each of the Company and Parent to terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger is not consummated by December 6, 2017 (subject to a three-month extension under certain circumstances at the discretion of either the Company or Parent). The Merger Agreement provides for other customary termination rights for both the Company and Parent (including, for Parent, if the Board changes its recommendation in respect of the Merger) as more particularly set forth in the Merger Agreement. The Company is required to pay Parent a termination fee equal to $30.0 million following termination of the Agreement in the following circumstances: (i) the requisite stockholder approval has not been obtained by the termination date, and an alternative acquisition proposal to acquire the Company has been made or announced, and within 12 months of the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive agreement or consummates any alternative acquisition (as defined in the Merger Agreement), in such case, net of any expense fee paid by the Company to Parent in connection with the Merger; (ii) if either party terminates the Merger Agreement because the Bankruptcy Court Order has not been entered by the bankruptcy court by the date provided for such approval in the Settlement Agreement, and within 12 months of the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive agreement or consummates any alternative acquisition (as defined in the Merger Agreement), in such case, net of any expense fee paid by the Company to Parent in connection with the Merger; (iii) if either party terminates the Merger Agreement because the requisite stockholder approval has not been obtained or because the Agreement has not been consummated by the termination date, and at the time of termination, the Board has changed its recommendation in respect of the Merger; or (iv) if Parent terminates the Merger Agreement because the Board has made and not withdrawn a change of recommendation in respect of the Merger and at the time of Parent’s termination the Company has not obtained the requisite stockholder approval of the Merger or the Bankruptcy Court Order has not been entered by the bankruptcy court.  In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, under certain circumstances, the Company has agreed to pay to Parent an $8.0 million expense reimbursement fee.
The representations, warranties and covenants of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement have been made solely for the benefit of Parent and Merger Sub. In addition, such representations, warranties and covenants (a) have been made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement, (b) have been qualified by confidential disclosures made to Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the Merger Agreement, (c) are subject to materiality qualifications contained in the Merger Agreement that may differ from what may be viewed as material by investors and (d) have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating risk among the contracting parties rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, the Merger Agreement is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K only to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement, and not to provide investors with any other factual information regarding the Company or its business. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed after the date of the Merger Agreement and may continue to change in the future, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company’s public disclosures. 
11

Our entry into the Merger Agreement, and our exploration of strategic alternatives generally, involve certain risks and uncertainties, which may, among other things, disrupt our business or adversely impact our revenue, operating results and financial condition. A change of control of the Company without the consent of the lenders under our corporate level revolving credit facility (the "Revolver") would constitute an event of default under our Revolver and, pursuant to the indenture governing the Senior Notes, a change of control of the Company would require TerraForm Global Operating, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global LLC (“Global Operating LLC”), to offer to repurchase its outstanding Senior Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date. Additionally, the occurrence of such changes may trigger change of control provisions in certain of our PPAs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the Merger, and failure to complete the Merger may adversely impact our business. See “Risks Related to the Brookfield Transaction,” “Risks Related to a Failure to Complete the Brookfield Transaction,” “Risks Related to our Relationship with SunEdison and the SunEdison Bankruptcy” and “Risks Related to our Business” in Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the Voting and Support Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement and the Voting and Support Agreement, copies of which were included as Exhibit 2.1 and Exhibit 2.3, respectively, to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 7, 2017 and which are incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Renova Settlement Agreement and the Renova Letter Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Renova Settlement Agreement and the Renova Letter Agreement, copies of which were included as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 30, 2017 and which are incorporated herein by reference.
SunEdison Bankruptcy and Settlement Agreement with SunEdison
As discussed in “Business,” “Risk Factors” and this and other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the SunEdison Bankruptcy may have a material adverse effect on the Company. No assurance can be given on the outcome of the SunEdison Bankruptcy or its impact on the Company. Our Conflicts Committee is responsible for oversight and approval of the business and affairs of the Company relating to or involving SunEdison and any of its affiliates (other than the Company), including in connection with the SunEdison Bankruptcy. The matters described in this section entitled “SunEdison Bankruptcy and Settlement Agreement with SunEdison” and other matters that presented conflict of interest issues between the Company and SunEdison have been approved and authorized pursuant to this authority by those members of the Conflicts Committee in place at the time the applicable decision was made.
The Company is not a part of the SunEdison Bankruptcy and does not rely substantially on SunEdison for funding, liquidity, or operational or staffing support. The Company continues to participate actively in the SunEdison Bankruptcy proceedings, and the SunEdison Bankruptcy will continue to have a negative impact on the Company given our complex relationship with SunEdison.
During the SunEdison Bankruptcy, SunEdison has not performed substantially as obligated under its agreements with us, including under sponsorship arrangements consisting of the various corporate level agreements put in place at the time of the Company’s IPO (collectively, the “Sponsorship Arrangement”) and certain O&M and asset management arrangements. SunEdison’s failure to perform substantially as obligated under its agreements with us, including under the Sponsorship Arrangement, project level O&M and asset management agreements and other support agreements may have a material adverse effect on the Company. Despite these adverse effects, the Company operates its business without significant support from SunEdison pursuant to plans for transitioning away from reliance on SunEdison that we are in the process of implementing. These plans include, among other things, establishing stand-alone information technology, accounting and other critical systems and infrastructure, directly hiring our employees, and retaining third parties to provide O&M and asset management services for our power plants where we do not perform these services ourselves. In addition to the one-time costs of implementing a stand-alone organization, our business will be adversely affected to the extent we are unsuccessful in implementing the relevant plans or the resulting ongoing long-term costs are higher than the costs we expected to incur with SunEdison as a sponsor.
The project level financing agreements for our two remaining levered power plants in India and our three power plants in South Africa contain provisions that provide the lenders with the right to accelerate debt maturity due to the SunEdison Bankruptcy because SunEdison is an original sponsor of the project and/or a party to certain material project agreements, such as O&M and EPC related contracts. In addition, certain audited financial statements at the project level were delayed and may be delayed again in the future. Future delays would create defaults at the project level for our levered power plants. If not cured or waived, these defaults may restrict the ability of the project companies to make distributions to us and may provide the lenders with the right to accelerate debt maturity. However, neither our Revolver nor the indenture governing the Senior Notes includes an event of default provision triggered by the SunEdison Bankruptcy, and none of our power purchase agreements 
12

includes a provision that would permit the offtake counterparty to terminate the agreement as a result of the SunEdison Bankruptcy. See Item 15. Note 10. - Project Level Debt for further detail regarding project level debt. 
On September 25, 2016, the Company filed its initial proof of claim in the SunEdison Bankruptcy, and filed an amended proof of claim on October 7, 2016. As set forth in the proofs of claim, the Company believes it has unsecured claims against SunEdison that it estimates are in excess of $2.0 billion. These claims include, without limitation, claims for damages relating to breach of SunEdison's obligations under the Sponsorship Arrangement between the Company and SunEdison and other agreements; contribution and indemnification claims arising from litigation; claims relating to SunEdison’s breach of fiduciary, agency and other duties; and claims for interference with and the disruption of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the loss of business opportunities, loss of business records, failure to provide timely audited financials, and the increased cost of financing and commercial arrangements. Many of these claims are contingent, unliquidated and/or disputed by SunEdison and other parties in interest in the SunEdison Bankruptcy, and the estimated amounts of these claims may change substantially as circumstances develop and damages are determined. In addition, recoveries on unsecured claims in the SunEdison Bankruptcy are expected to be significantly impaired. 
In addition, the Company believes that it may have claims entitled to administrative priority against SunEdison, including, without limitation, claims with respect to certain expenses that the Company has incurred after the commencement of the SunEdison Bankruptcy; however, the Company expects SunEdison and other parties in interest in the SunEdison Bankruptcy to dispute both the amount of these claims and whether or not these claims are entitled to administrative priority over other claims against SunEdison.
On November 7, 2016, the unsecured creditors’ committee in the SunEdison Bankruptcy case filed a motion with the bankruptcy court seeking standing to assert against the Company, on behalf of SunEdison, avoidance claims arising from intercompany transactions between the Company and SunEdison. If the Settlement Agreement becomes effective, we expect this standing motion will be withdrawn. If the Settlement Agreement is terminated or if the standing motion is not withdrawn, the Company expects to vigorously contest this standing motion and, if standing is granted, the underlying avoidance claims.
On March 6, 2017, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with SunEdison in connection with the SunEdison Bankruptcy and the Merger Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”). The Settlement Agreement was approved by the bankruptcy court overseeing the SunEdison Bankruptcy on June 7, 2017; however, its effectiveness is conditional on the completion of the Brookfield Transaction. The Settlement Agreement contains certain terms to resolve the complex legal relationship between the Company and SunEdison, including, among other things, an allocation of the total consideration paid in connection with the Brookfield Transaction and, with certain exceptions, the full mutual release of all claims between SunEdison and its affiliated debtors and non-debtors, on the one hand, and the Company and its subsidiaries, on the other hand. Under the settlement terms, following the exchange of all of its Class B shares in TerraForm Global, Inc. and the Class B units in Global LLC for Class A Shares, SunEdison will receive consideration equal to 25% of the total consideration paid to all of the Company's shareholders, reflecting the settlement of intercompany claims and cancellation of incentive distribution rights. The remaining 75% of the consideration will be distributed to existing Class A shareholders. In addition, upon the effectiveness of the Settlement Agreement, with certain limited exceptions, all agreements between the Company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and SunEdison and its subsidiaries, on the other hand, including the agreements comprising the Sponsorship Arrangement, would be terminated. There can be no assurance that the Settlement Agreement will become effective, and such failure may adversely impact our business. See “Risks Related to a Failure to Complete the Brookfield Transaction,” “Risks Related to our Relationship with SunEdison and the SunEdison Bankruptcy” and “Risks Related to our Business” in Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information. The foregoing description of the Settlement Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Settlement Agreement, a copy of which was included as Exhibit 2.2 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 7, 2017 and which is incorporated herein by reference.
Nasdaq Compliance
On March 31, 2016, we received a notification letter from a Director of Nasdaq Listing Qualifications. The notification letter stated that because the Company had not yet filed its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of periodic reports with the SEC. 
On May 17, 2016, we received an additional notification letter from a Director of Nasdaq Listing Qualifications. The notification letter stated that because the Company had not yet filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, and because it remained delinquent in filing its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). 
13

On May 27, 2016, in compliance with the deadline specified in the notification letters, the Company submitted a plan to Nasdaq as to how it planned to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements. 
On June 10, 2016, the Company received a letter from a Director of Nasdaq Listing Qualifications granting the Company an exception of 180 calendar days from the due date of the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, or until September 26, 2016, to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements. 
On August 16, 2016, we received an additional notification letter from a Director of Nasdaq Listing Qualifications. The notification letter stated that because the Company had not yet filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1).
On September 9, 2016, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq stating that due to the Company’s ongoing non-compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements, the Company would be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market at the opening of business on September 20, 2016 unless the Company requested a hearing on the determination by September 16, 2016. On September 9, 2016, the Company requested a hearing and also requested a stay of the delisting, pending the hearing. On September 15, 2016, we received a letter from Nasdaq granting our request to extend the stay of delisting until the hearings panel made a decision after the hearing scheduled for November 3, 2016. At the hearing on November 3, 2016, the Company requested from Nasdaq an extension until March 27, 2017 to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements with respect to its delayed Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and its delayed Forms 10-Q for the periods ended March 31 and June 30, 2016. 
On November 15, 2016, the Company received a notification letter from a Hearings Advisor from the Nasdaq Office of General Counsel informing the Company that the hearings panel granted the Company’s request for an extension until March 27, 2017 with respect to its delayed Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and its delayed Forms 10-Q for the first, second and third quarters of 2016.

Based on discussions with the hearings panel’s staff, the extension until March 27, 2017 granted by the hearings panel also covered the non-compliance by the Company with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) caused by the failure of the Company to timely file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 
The Company filed its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 on December 21, 2016, its Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016 on December 23, 2016, its Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016 on January 31, 2017 and its Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016 on February 21, 2017. Therefore, as of February 21, 2017, the Company had filed all of its periodic reports with the SEC that were previously identified by Nasdaq as delinquent and the Company was current in its periodic filings with the SEC. On February 21, 2017, the Company requested an extension until June 30, 2017 to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements with respect to its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and its Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017, which the Company expected to be delayed beyond applicable SEC deadlines.

On January 4, 2017, the Company received a notification letter from a Senior Director of Nasdaq Listing Qualification, which stated that the Company's failure to hold its annual meeting by December 31, 2016, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a) (the “Annual Meeting Rule”), serves as an additional basis for delisting the Company's securities and that the hearings panel would consider this matter in their decision regarding the Company's continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. On January 11, 2017, the Company submitted a response requesting an extension to hold an annual meeting and regain compliance with the Annual Meeting Rule.
On March 20, 2017, the Company received a notification letter from a Hearings Advisor from the Nasdaq Office of General Counsel informing the Company that the hearings panel granted the Company an extension until June 30, 2017 to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements with respect to its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017 and its delinquency in holding its annual meeting during the year ended December 31, 2016.

14

On May 15, 2017, the Company received a notification letter from a Senior Director of Nasdaq Listing Qualifications stating that because the Company has not yet filed its Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017, this serves as an additional basis for delisting the Company’s securities from the Nasdaq Stock Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1).
The Company's annual meeting of stockholders for 2017 has been scheduled for June 29, 2017.

Creation of LLC Conflicts Committee
On June 1, 2016, TerraForm Global, Inc., acting in its capacity as the sole managing member of Global LLC, adopted a second amendment (the “LLC Agreement Amendment”) to the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Global LLC, dated as of August 5, 2015 (as amended from time to time, the “Global LLC Agreement”). Pursuant to the LLC Agreement Amendment, until the first annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders held after December 31, 2016, the Company delegated to an independent conflicts committee (the “LLC Conflicts Committee”) the exclusive power to exercise all of its rights, powers and authority as the sole managing member of Global LLC to manage and control the business and affairs of Global LLC and its controlled affiliates relating to or involving SunEdison and any of its affiliates (other than the Company and its controlled affiliates) (as more specifically defined in the LLC Agreement Amendment, the “Conflicts Matters”).
The LLC Agreement Amendment was approved and authorized by the Company’s Conflicts Committee pursuant to the power and authority delegated to it by resolutions of the Board dated March 25, 2016 authorizing the Conflicts Committee, in anticipation of and in connection with a bankruptcy filing by SunEdison, to evaluate and act affirmatively with respect to matters involving or substantially relating to SunEdison, including actions to protect the Company’s contractual and other rights and otherwise to preserve the value of the Company and its assets. The decision to delegate authority to the Conflicts Committee with respect to these SunEdison related matters was taken by the Board in light of the obligation that material matters relating to SunEdison be approved by the Conflicts Committee. On June 1, 2016, the Board reaffirmed the power and authority delegated to the Conflicts Committee with respect to these SunEdison related matters by ratifying the adoption of the LLC Agreement Amendment.
The current members of the LLC Conflicts Committee are Messrs. Lerdal, Boyle and Mack. New members may be appointed (i) by a majority of LLC Conflicts Committee members then in office or (ii) by the Company (in its capacity as managing member of Global LLC) with the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock of TerraForm Global, Inc., excluding any such shares held, directly or indirectly, by SunEdison or any of its affiliates (“Independent Shareholder Approval”).
Each member of the LLC Conflicts Committee must satisfy, in the determination of the LLC Conflicts Committee, the Nasdaq Global Select Market standards for “independent directors” and nominations committee members.
The delegation of exclusive power and authority to the LLC Conflicts Committee under the LLC Agreement Amendment may not be revoked and the members of the LLC Conflicts Committee may not be removed, other than by a written instrument signed by the Company, acting in its capacity as managing member of Global LLC, with either (i) the written consent of a majority of the LLC Conflicts Committee members then in office, or (ii) Independent Shareholder Approval.

Creation of Compensation Committee
For purposes of the applicable stock exchange rules, the Company is a “controlled company.” As a controlled company, the Company may rely upon certain exceptions, including with respect to establishing a compensation committee or nominating committee. While the Company remains able to rely upon such exceptions, on January 10, 2017, the Board created a Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”).
The Compensation Committee is responsible for, among other matters: (i) reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, (ii) determining, or recommending to the Board for determination, the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation level based on this evaluation, (iii) determining, or recommending to the Board for determination, the compensation of directors and all other executive officers, (iv) discharging the responsibility of the Board with respect to the Company’s incentive compensation plans and equity-based plans, (v) overseeing compliance with respect to compensation matters, (vi) reviewing and approving severance or similar termination payments to any current or former executive officer of the Company, and (vii) preparing an annual Compensation Committee Report, if required by applicable SEC rules. 
The Compensation Committee consists of three members, Messrs. Lerdal, Mack and Stark. Mr. Lerdal has been designated as the Chairman of the Compensation Committee. The Board has adopted a written charter for the Compensation Committee, which is available on the Company’s corporate website, http://www.terraformglobal.com.
Dividends
On November 10, 2015, the Company declared a dividend for the third quarter of 2015 on the Company’s Class A common stock of $0.1704 per share, which was paid on December 15, 2015 to stockholders of record on December 1, 2015. This amount represents a quarterly dividend of $0.275 per share.
On February 29, 2016, the Company declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of 2015 on the Company’s Class A common stock of $0.275 per share. The dividend was paid on March 17, 2016 to stockholders of record as of March 10, 2016. The Company did not declare or pay a dividend for the first, second, third or fourth quarter of 2016. Prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, as a result of the SunEdison Bankruptcy, the limitations on our ability to access the capital markets for our corporate debt and equity securities, and other risks that we face as detailed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believed it was prudent to defer any decisions on paying dividends to our stockholders. Under the Merger Agreement, we are restricted from declaring or paying dividends prior to the consummation of the Brookfield Transaction.
Acquisitions
See Item 15. Note 4 - Acquisitions for information regarding the acquisitions completed by the Company, the Company’s pending acquisition, incomplete IPO project transfers and dropdowns, and terminated acquisitions.
Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Notes due 2022 
Permanent Termination of Revolving Commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility
On March 31, 2017, Global Operating LLC permanently reduced to zero and terminated the revolving commitments under our Revolver and entered into a fifth amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Revolver. The Fifth Amendment provides that Global LLC will no longer be required to deliver to the administrative agent and the other lenders party to the Revolver its annual financial statements and accompanying audit reports, unaudited quarterly financial statements, annual compliance certificates, statements of reconciliation after changes in accounting principles, annual financial plans and reconciliations of non-recourse project indebtedness pursuant to the Revolver, and removes the requirement that Global LLC and its subsidiaries comply with certain financial ratios contained in the Revolver. The Fifth Amendment requires Global Operating LLC to provide the administrative agent under the Revolver with an annual collateral verification within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year. 
On March 30, 2016, Global Operating LLC entered into a first amendment to the Revolver to amend certain financial covenants to extend the date on which the Company must deliver to the administrative agent and the other lenders party to the Revolver its financial statements and accompanying audit report with respect to the year ended December 31, 2015 (the “2015 Financials”) to April 30, 2016 and to provide for the engagement of a financial consultant to serve as advisor to the Revolver lenders. On April 29, 2016, Global Operating LLC entered into a second amendment to the Revolver, which further extended the due date for the delivery of the 2015 Financials to May 7, 2016.
17

However, on May 6, 2016, Global Operating LLC entered into a third amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to the Revolver. The Third Amendment reduced the aggregate amount of the revolving commitments to $350.0 million. Additionally, the Third Amendment extended the date by which the Company must deliver to the Administrative Agent and the other lenders party to the Revolver the 2015 Financials to the earlier of (a) the tenth business day prior to the date on which the failure to deliver the 2015 Financials would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes and (b) March 30, 2017. The Third Amendment also extended the date by which the Company must deliver its unaudited quarterly financial statements with respect to the quarter ended March 31, 2016 to June 30, 2016 and with respect to the fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016 to the date that is 75 days after the end of each fiscal quarter. The Third Amendment also required the Company to undertake certain additional obligations, including (1) to provide the lenders with preliminary financial information for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, (2) to comply with Nasdaq requirements for submitting compliance plans for the Company’s delayed filings and (3) to request a waiver or amendment under the indenture governing the Senior Notes with respect to Global Operating LLC’s obligation to make available audited financial statements for fiscal year 2015. The Company has complied with all three requirements. 
On September 13, 2016, Global Operating LLC entered into a fourth amendment (the "Fourth Amendment") to the Revolver pursuant to the requirements of the Third Amendment to increase the applicable margin used to determine the interest rate on loans under the Revolver under certain circumstances relating to a waiver or amendment under the Senior Notes. 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had issued a letter of credit for $0.4 million under the terms of the Revolver in support of the Alto Cielo acquisition. The letter of credit was terminated on March 23, 2017 in connection with the Fifth Amendment. 
Senior Notes Due 2022
In December 2015, the Company’s Board approved a $40.0 million open market repurchase program for the Company’s Senior Notes. The repurchase program began in December 2015 and continued through January 2016. As of December 31, 2015, $8.6 million of the Senior Notes were repurchased for $6.8 million, and the Company paid $0.4 million of accrued interest and prepayment fees. As of December 31, 2015, $0.4 million was included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet representing principal and interest due to an investment bank for repurchases completed in December 2015 but settled in January 2016. A gain on extinguishment of $6.3 million was recognized related to these repurchases and is included in loss on extinguishment of debt, net for the year ended December 31, 2016. In January 2016, the Company repurchased $41.0 million of the Senior Notes for $33.2 million and paid $1.9 million of interest and prepayment fees. In total, the Company repurchased $49.6 million of the Senior Notes for $40.0 million plus prepayment fees and interest of $2.3 million. 
On May 11, 2016, Global Operating LLC received a letter on behalf of certain beneficial holders of the Senior Notes, which purported to constitute a notice of default with respect to the failure of Global Operating LLC to comply with its obligations under the indenture governing the Senior Notes to timely furnish the Company’s annual report for the year ended December 31, 2015. On May 13, 2016, Global Operating LLC sent a response to this letter, stating that the purported notice of default was untimely, and therefore ineffective, under the indenture.
On May 31, 2016, Global Operating LLC received a notice of default from the trustee under the indenture governing the Senior Notes with respect to the failure of Global Operating LLC to comply with its obligations under the indenture governing the Senior Notes to timely furnish the Company’s annual report for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
Global Operating LLC received a notice of default, dated July 15, 2016, from the trustee under the indenture governing the Senior Notes with respect to the failure of Global Operating LLC to comply with its obligations under the indenture governing the Senior Notes to timely furnish the Company's Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2016.
On September 2, 2016, the Company announced the successful completion of a consent solicitation to obtain waivers relating to certain reporting covenants under the indenture governing the Senior Notes and to effectuate certain amendments to the indenture governing the Senior Notes. Global Operating LLC received validly delivered and unrevoked consents from the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes outstanding as of the record date. Global Operating LLC paid to each consenting holder a consent fee of $5.00 for each $1,000 principal amount of the Senior Notes held by such holder as to which Global Operating LLC received and accepted consents. Under the terms of the waivers, the deadline to comply with the reporting covenants in the indenture governing the Senior Notes relating to the filing of the Company’s Form 10-K for 2015 and Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2016 was extended to December 6, 2016. Compliance with the reporting covenants in the indenture relating to the filing of the Company’s Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2016 was also waived until December 6, 2016, with no event of default expected to occur with respect to the Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2016 unless such Form 10-Q were not filed by early March 2017.
18

On September 2, 2016, Global Operating LLC entered into a second supplemental indenture (the “Second Supplemental Indenture”) to the indenture governing the Senior Notes. The Second Supplemental Indenture, among other things, (i) provided for additional special interest on the Senior Notes beginning on September 6, 2016 through December 6, 2016 at a rate equal to 4.0% per annum; (ii) required Global Operating LLC to repay the borrowing then outstanding (other than the outstanding letters of credit) under the Revolver and restricted the ability of Global Operating LLC to further borrow or issue any additional letters of credit under the Revolver until the earlier of March 8, 2017 or such time as SunEdison has disposed of all or substantially all of its equity interests in the Company and Global Operating LLC has offered to repurchase its outstanding Senior Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date (or a binding agreement to make such an offer has been entered into); (iii) imposed additional restrictions and conditions (including, in some cases, that require the existence of a board of directors of the Company that is independent from SunEdison) on the ability of Global LLC and its restricted subsidiaries to make restricted payments and permitted investments or to incur indebtedness or permitted liens; (iv) imposed restrictions and conditions on the ability of Global LLC and its restricted subsidiaries to settle, or pay settlement amounts in respect of, litigation claims involving excess settlement amounts and (v) required Global LLC to provide legal and financial advisors to certain ad hoc holders of the Senior Notes with certain information, including certain information delivered to the lenders under the Revolver.
On December 2, 2016, Global Operating LLC received a letter from the trustee under the indenture governing the Senior Notes, which purported to constitute a notice of default with respect to the failure of Global Operating LLC to comply with its obligations under the indenture governing the Senior Notes to timely furnish the Company’s Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2016. Global Operating LLC sent a response to this letter, stating that the purported notice of default was untimely, and therefore ineffective, under the indenture.
On December 6, 2016, the Company announced the successful completion of another consent solicitation to obtain additional waivers relating to certain reporting covenants under the indenture governing the Senior Notes. Global Operating LLC received validly delivered and unrevoked consents from the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes outstanding as of the record date. Global Operating LLC paid to each consenting holder an initial consent fee of $3.50 for each $1,000 principal amount of the Senior Notes held by such holder as to which Global Operating LLC received and accepted consents. Under the terms of the additional waivers, the deadline to comply with the reporting covenants in the indenture governing the Senior Notes relating to the filing of the Company’s annual and quarterly reports required to be filed (including the Form 10-K for 2015 and the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2016) was extended to December 26, 2016, with Global Operating LLC having the option to further extend the deadline to January 6, 2017, to the extent necessary, by paying an extension fee. 
Global Operating LLC received a notice of default, dated January 17, 2017, from the trustee under the indenture governing the Senior Notes with respect to the failure of Global Operating LLC to comply with its obligations under the indenture governing the Senior Notes to timely furnish the Company's Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2016. However, no event of default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes occurred with respect to the Company's Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2016 because such Form 10-Q was filed before an event of default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes would otherwise arise.
Global Operating LLC received a notice of default, dated May 16, 2017, from the trustee under the indenture governing the Senior Notes with respect to the failure of Global Operating LLC to comply with its obligations under the indenture governing the Senior Notes to timely furnish the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. No event of default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes occurred due to the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K before an event of default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes would otherwise arise.
Covenant defaults may occur in the future under the indenture governing the Senior Notes in the event of further delays in the filing of our periodic reports with the SEC. There can be no assurance that we will be able to file our periodic reports (including our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 or any quarters thereafter) with the SEC within the periods currently required under the indenture governing the Senior Notes or that holders of the Senior Notes will agree to any required extension of financial statement filing dates on acceptable terms or at all. A default on the Senior Notes would permit the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding to accelerate the Senior Notes. The Company would likely not have sufficient liquidity to meet this obligation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends. 
Call Right Projects 
Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO on August 5, 2015, Global LLC entered into a project support agreement with SunEdison (the “Support Agreement”). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, SunEdison granted the Company call rights with respect to projects identified therein by SunEdison (“Call Right Projects”) that had an aggregate net nameplate 
19

capacity of 1.6 GW (or reasonably equivalent projects), and SunEdison was contractually required to offer Global LLC additional qualifying projects through the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO that were projected to generate an aggregate of at least $1.4 billion of cash available for distribution during their respective first twelve months of commercial operation. At the time of the IPO, SunEdison had pending agreements with third-party developers to acquire clean energy projects that had an aggregate capacity of 4.2 GW, which were expected to be added to the call rights list under the Support Agreement. In addition, the Support Agreement granted Global LLC a right of first offer with respect to any clean energy projects (other than Call Right Projects) (“ROFO Projects”) that SunEdison elected to sell or otherwise transfer during the six-year period following the completion of the IPO and that were located in the Company’s initial target markets and other emerging markets that the parties mutually agreed upon. 
Following the SunEdison Bankruptcy, SunEdison breached the Support Agreement and we will not acquire any of the Call Right Projects or ROFO Projects. On September 25, 2016, we announced that as a result of SunEdison’s breach under the Support Agreement and other agreements constituting the Sponsorship Arrangement, the Company filed claims against SunEdison in excess of $2 billion. The claims include, without limitation, claims for damages relating to breach of SunEdison's obligations under the Sponsorship Arrangement and other agreements; contribution and indemnification claims arising from litigation; claims relating to SunEdison’s breach of fiduciary, agency and other duties; and claims for interference with and the disruption of the business of the Company, including the loss of business opportunities, loss of business records, failure to provide timely audited financials, and the increased cost of financing and commercial arrangements. Many of these claims are contingent or unliquidated; estimated amounts may change substantially as circumstances develop and damages are determined. Although SunEdison has not formally rejected the Sponsorship Arrangement, it has breached its obligations thereunder and the Company has additional claims for rejection damages. The Company’s claims against SunEdison in connection with the Support Agreement would be released upon the effectiveness of the Settlement Agreement.
Seasonality
The amount of electricity our solar power plants produce is dependent in part on the amount of sunlight, or irradiation, where the assets are located. Because shorter daylight hours in winter months results in less irradiation, the generation of particular assets will vary depending on the season. Additionally, to the extent more of our solar power plants are located in either the northern or southern hemisphere, overall generation of our entire solar asset portfolio could be impacted by seasonality. While we expect seasonal variability to occur, we expect aggregate seasonal variability to decrease if geographic diversity of our portfolio between the northern and southern hemisphere increases. We expect our current solar portfolio’s power generation to be at its lowest during the fourth quarter of each year as our assets are geographically concentrated in the northern hemisphere. 
Similarly, the electricity produced and revenues generated by a wind power plant depend heavily on wind conditions, which are variable and difficult to predict. Operating results for wind power plants vary significantly from period to period depending on the windiness during the periods in question. Because our wind power plants are located in geographies with different profiles, there is some flattening of the seasonal variability associated with each individual power plant’s generation, and we expect that as the fleet expands the effect of such wind resource variability may be favorably impacted, although we cannot guarantee that we will purchase wind power facilities that will achieve such results in part or at all. Historically, our wind production is greater in the first and fourth quarters which can partially offset the lower solar revenue generated in the fourth quarter. 
Under the Merger Agreement, we are restricted from declaring or paying dividends prior to the consummation of the Brookfield Transaction. However, in the event that the Brookfield Transaction is not consummated and the Merger Agreement is terminated or expires, we intend to revert to a situation where we reserve a portion of our cash available for distribution and maintain sufficient liquidity, including cash on hand, in order to, among other things, facilitate the payment of future dividends to our stockholders. As a result, we do not expect seasonality to have a material effect on the amount of our future quarterly dividends.
Competition
Power generation is a capital-intensive business with numerous industry participants. We compete to acquire new solar and wind power plants with renewable energy developers who retain renewable energy power generation asset ownership, independent power producers, financial investors and certain utilities. We compete to supply energy to our potential customers with utilities and providers of distributed generation. We compete with other solar and wind developers, independent power producers and financial investors based on our cost of capital, development expertise, pipeline, technology, global footprint and brand reputation. To the extent we re-contract power plants upon termination of a PPA or sell electricity into the merchant power market, we compete with traditional utilities primarily based on low cost of capital, generation located at customer sites, 
20

operations and management expertise, price (including predictability of price), green attributes of power and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar and wind power plants.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we own and operate solar and wind power plants. These laws and regulations generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained and maintained both before construction and during operation of these power generation assets. We incur costs in the ordinary course of business to comply with these laws, regulations and permit requirements. While we do not expect that the costs of compliance would generally have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, it is possible that we may become subject to new or modified regulatory regimes that may impose unanticipated requirements on our business as a whole that were not anticipated with respect to any individual power plant. We also do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental controls for our solar and wind power plants in the next several years. These laws and regulations frequently change and often become more stringent, or subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement, and therefore future changes could require us to incur materially higher costs which could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance or results of operations.
Regulatory Matters 
Overview 
None of the power plants included in our portfolio are located in the United States. As a result, all of these power plants are generally exempt from U.S.-based federal and state regulation of electric utilities, including most provisions of the U.S. Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and the Federal Power Act. Our solar and wind power plants are subject to various laws and regulations in the countries in which they operate. Some of these countries, such as Uruguay, have deregulated electric generation markets that require governmental approval before becoming an eligible power generator while others, such as Malaysia, have more robust regulatory regimes governing the production, purchase and sale of electric generation. Set forth below is a brief overview of the principal laws and regulations that are applicable to the markets in which a significant portion of our power plants are located.
China 
Solar and wind energy policies in China are formulated and carried out by various government entities and agencies and also are integrated into the country’s broader regulatory framework for electricity generation and transmission. Additionally, in the case of foreign owners of solar and wind energy assets, the government entities involved in regulating foreign investment in China will also play a key oversight role in certain instances.
The National Energy Administration (“NEA”) a government entity under the regulation and supervision of the National Development and Reform Commission (“NDRC”) formulates solar and wind energy policies. The implementation and enforcement of these policies is overseen by provincial, regional and municipal offices of the NDRC and NEA. These local offices are responsible for, among other things, issuing electricity business licenses, overseeing the construction of solar and wind power plants within their jurisdictions and (subject to variation in practice among different types of facilities and different localities) approving changes of ownership of solar or wind power plants. For instance, pursuant to guidance issued by the NDRC in October 2014 and May 2016, a solar power plant which has been filed with the local NEA counterpart cannot be transferred before the solar power plant begins production without the consent of the applicable NEA counterpart. Any material change made to a solar power plant, including the change of construction site and construction content, must be submitted to the local counterpart of the NEA for re-filing.
Solar and wind power plants are also subject to standards and regulations affecting the electricity industry in general, as set out in legislation or otherwise formulated by the NEA, as well as the standards and business practices of China’s state-owned grid companies, State Grid Corporation and the smaller China Southern Power Grid Corporation. These grid companies, through their provincial subsidiaries, play a de facto regulatory role by issuing approvals for the interconnection with the power grids and executing interconnection and dispatch agreements as well as PPAs with the project companies. Power purchase agreements with the grid companies are usually short term in duration, typically one year subject to annual extensions. Under China’s Renewable Energy Law, the grid companies are obligated to accept all energy produced by duly licensed and operating solar and wind power plants. In practice, however, solar and wind power plants have been subject to curtailment by grid companies due to transmission capacity and other infrastructure constraints.
Solar and wind power plants owned in whole or in part by foreign entities are also subject to the general foreign investment regulatory regime administered by the Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”) and State Administration of Foreign Exchange. Foreign investment in the solar and wind power industry is currently listed by MOFCOM as an “encouraged” 
21

activity, which means new solar or wind power plants may be developed by a wholly foreign owned enterprise on the same basis as they may be developed by a domestic enterprise. However, if a foreign investor seeks to acquire a solar or wind power plant (whether operating or under construction), it must obtain the approval of either the national office of MOFCOM or its regional offices (depending on the total monetary value of the power plant and structure of the acquisition).
Under current Chinese law, acquisition of a solar or wind power plant by a foreign party does not in itself require approval from State Administration of Foreign Exchange, but any foreign loans issued by a foreign party (including stockholder loans) must be registered with SAFE before they may be disbursed.
Brazil 
The National Electric Energy Agency (“ANEEL”) and the Energy Research Company are the predominant regulatory bodies governing the electricity generation sector in Brazil. These governmental agencies are responsible for enacting rules and regulations related to, among others, granting licenses to enter the electricity generation market, setting tariff rates, regulating the auction process used to award PPAs and establishing the incentive structure for producers of renewable energy.
The electricity market in Brazil is divided into two segments: (i) the regulated market where electric energy is supplied at rates and tariffs resulting from auctions to sell electric energy to distribution companies or to the Electric Energy Commercialization Chamber (CCEE), and (ii) the free market, in which any supplier (generators, distributors, self-producers, independent producers, traders of energy, etc.) can directly sell energy to consumers at market rates.
We currently market energy generated by our wind power plants in the regulated market. With respect to the regulated market, the ANEEL established an auction system for awarding contracts for the production of renewable energy. Domestic and foreign companies (solely or in consortium), private equity funds and special purpose vehicles are eligible to bid at auction. If a foreign company prevails at an auction, it must incorporate a Brazilian company to receive the power generation authorization and to enter into the PPA. Bidders are required to deposit a bid bond equal to 1.0% of the power plant’s estimated cost, which must be declared by the bidder and approved by the ANEEL beforehand. This bond is returned after the contract is signed if the bidder wins the auction; otherwise, it is returned immediately following the auction. Auction winners also need to deposit a project performance bond equal to 5% of the investment cost that is released after certain power plant milestones are completed.
Several penalties are applicable in the event of delay in achieving certain milestones set in the PPA contract and in the ANEEL authorization. Among other default events, the ANEEL has the right to terminate the contract if a delay in achieving milestones exceeds one year. 
Brazilian law does not restrict the foreign ownership of electricity generating companies, but a company owning generation projects in the electric energy sector must be incorporated in Brazil. 
India 
The Electricity Act, 2003 (the “Electricity Act”) is the principal legislation that regulates the generation, transmission, distribution, trading and use of electricity in India. The Electricity Act governs the establishment, operation and maintenance of energy generating companies and prescribes technical standards in relation to its connectivity with the Indian power grid. The Electricity Act provides that an energy-generating company may establish, operate and maintain a generating facility without obtaining a license under the Electricity Act if it complies with the prescribed technical standards relating to connectivity with the power grid. In addition, an energy-generating company is permitted to sell electricity to any distribution or trading licensee and, where permitted by the respective state regulatory commissions, to consumers subject to availing open access to the transmission and distribution systems and upon payment of applicable charges.
The Electricity Act establishes a two-level regulatory system: (i) the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (“CERC”) is responsible for regulating the tariff charged by generating facilities owned by the Indian government and other independent power producers involved in generating or supplying electricity in more than one state, and for regulating the inter-state transmission of electricity, and (ii) State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (“SERCs”) are responsible for regulating intra-state transmission and supply of electricity within each of their respective states. These commissions are responsible for a variety of functions, including determining tariff levels, granting licenses and settling disputes between the generating companies and the licensees. 
The Indian government has established the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (“MNRE”), to facilitate, on a national level, research, development, commercialization and deployment of renewable energy systems for various applications in rural, urban, industrial and commercial sectors. In 2011, the MNRE established the Solar Energy Corporation of India (“SECI”) as a not-for-profit company to facilitate the development of solar energy generating capacity in India. 
22

The Indian government has proposed amendments to the Electricity Act to focus on the development of renewable energy through the formulation of a National Renewable Energy Policy in consultation with state governments for the development of a power system based on optimal utilization of renewable sources of energy. It also requires coal and lignite based thermal generators to establish renewable energy capacity equal to at least 10% of their installed thermal power capacity.
In general, the tariff applicable to solar power plants is determined either through a “cost plus” method under which the appropriate regulatory commission determines the tariff based on the actual capital cost of the power plants, normative debt to equity ratios and other parameters prescribed under the multi-year tariff regulations adopted by the commissions; or through a competitive bidding process.
In the case of wind power plants, feed-in tariffs are determined taking into account capital cost submissions by various stakeholders and certain operation and maintenance costs and have been announced by the SERCs in certain states, such as the States of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, pursuant to the applicable policy in the respective states. Until last year, procurement of wind energy was not done on competitive basis in India. However, encouraged by the growth of solar energy sector, in 2017 the Indian government conducted its first ever tariff based auction for long term wind power contracts and is also in the process of finalizing detailed guidelines for procurement of wind power through competitive bidding.
South Africa 
South Africa has a framework of legislation and regulations governing its energy sector. The Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement (“REIPPP”) program is a governmental procurement program that effectively requires solar and wind facilities in South Africa to comply with this framework, including the various acts and policies regulating the governmental procurement process generally, the most important of these being the Public Finance Management Act, the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, and the Codes of Good Practice on Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment, and the various acts and policies regulating South African businesses generally and therefore also independent power producers, such as environmental, health and safety laws. 
The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (“NERSA”) is the primary regulator of South Africa’s energy sector and is responsible for regulating electricity, piped-gas and petroleum pipeline industries. Solar and wind facilities are governed by the Electricity Regulation Act, which is the primary enabling legislation for the REIPPP program, and by other legislation applicable to water affairs, environmental affairs, agriculture, forestry and fisheries and mineral resources. Under the REIPPP program, a solar or wind facility is regulated as an independent power producer and is authorized to produce and sell electricity to Eskom, the country’s largest state-owned power utility, pursuant to a license issued by NERSA. A solar or wind facility is not generally subject to regulation as a public utility in the traditional sense and, thus, is exempt from complying with South Africa’s complex system of power producer and procurement rules and regulations that are applicable to Eskom. 
Government Incentives 
Each of the markets where we operate has established various incentives and financial mechanisms to support the cost and to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatements, rebates and RECs or green certificates and net energy metering programs that are offered by some of the foreign governments where we operate. These incentives help catalyze private sector investments in renewable energy and efficiency measures. Set forth below is a summary of the various programs and incentives in markets in which a significant portion of our power plants are located.
China 
In recent years, the NDRC has initiated feed-in tariff programs for both solar and wind energy. Under these feed-in tariff programs, eligible solar and wind facilities are entitled to receive a special tariff, the amount of which is set by NDRC policy and which may vary based on the type of power plant (in the case of solar, for example, utility-scale versus distributed generation facilities; in the case of wind, onshore versus offshore developments), geographical location of the power plant and the date on which it commenced construction. Once a solar power plant qualifies for a particular tariff, the facility is entitled under NDRC policy to continue to receive the tariff for a period of 20 years from its commercial operation date. The special tariff remains constant, but consists of two components which may themselves change. One component is set to equal the prevailing rate that grid companies pay for base-load, desulfurized coal power (thus it is subject to change, though this base rate is currently determined by policy rather than market pricing and in recent history has not been subject to substantial fluctuations). This base load component is paid directly by the grid companies to the solar or wind power plant. The other component, called the green component, makes up the difference between the total special tariff and the prevailing base-load rate.
23

The green component of the tariff is paid from a renewable energy development fund administered by China’s Ministry of Finance, which in turn collects a surcharge that the grid companies charge to their end users. Payment of the green component is not made on the same schedule as payment of the base load component. Generally, payments of the base load component are made monthly while payments of the green component are required under law to be paid quarterly, but in practice in some provinces may be made only two or three times per year. Additionally, there is typically a gap, often of longer than one year, between an energy plant’s commercial operation date and the date on which it receives its first payment of the green component of the feed-in tariff. 
In late 2016, the Chinese government began to gradually reduce the government incentives that solar and wind power plants are eligible to receive from the feed-in tariff programs. For example, the feed-in tariff for solar power plants to be constructed after January 1, 2017 and onshore wind power plants to be approved for construction after January 1, 2018 will be reduced by approximately 20%. In addition, the NDRC and NEA have encouraged that tariffs for solar and wind power plants be determined through market competition, which may push the tariffs paid to solar and wind power project developers down and may also result in a reduction of the green component that solar and wind power plants are eligible to receive.
The Chinese government has also introduced “green electricity certificates” as an alternative to the feed-in tariff program. Eligible solar and onshore wind power plants may apply for green electricity certificates, which are calculated based on electricity generation, and sell such green electricity certificates to other entities at a price that is not higher than the green component. The solar and onshore wind power plants are no longer entitled to the green component for the amount of electricity that they generate but that is applied to the green electricity certificate program. The green electricity certificate program will be effective as of July 1, 2017.
In addition to the incentive programs described above, the solar industry has also benefited from the “Golden Sun Program” demonstration program that launched in 2009 as a strategy to support and further the development of the technology progress and scale of the national solar industry. Under the Golden Sun Program, the central government provided subsidies to eligible solar power plants interconnected to the power grid in an amount of 50% of its total investment and to eligible off-grid solar power plants located in remote areas without electricity supply at the amount of 70% of its total investment. Solar power plants participating in China’s feed-in tariff program were not eligible to participate in the Golden Sun Program. The Golden Sun Program expired in 2013.
Chinese financial institutions may offer preferential loans with a financial interest subsidy to renewable energy development and utilization facilities that are listed in the national renewable energy industrial development guidance catalog and satisfy certain conditions for granting loans.
Finally, under applicable Chinese tax law and regulations, an enterprise engaged in public infrastructure facilities approved after January 1, 2008, including solar and wind power plants, that satisfy certain requirements are entitled to a three-year full exemption from the enterprise income tax followed by a three-year 50% exemption commencing from the first year it generates operating income. In addition, solar and wind power plants are entitled to a 50% refund of the value-added tax levied on their electricity sales.
Brazil 
The main incentives available to encourage the use of renewable energy in Brazil include: (i) tax benefits; (ii) discounted transmission and distribution tariffs; (iii) special public funding provided by the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (“BNDES”); and (iv) research and development investment. 
Tax benefits. Renewable energy power plants may benefit from an exemption of monthly federal income taxes and may also be eligible for the exemption of certain import taxes. For example, the purchase of items needed for the construction of the wind and solar plants are exempted from certain import and value added taxes. 
Discount on transmission and distribution tariffs. Solar plants injecting up to 30 MW into the grid that start commercial operation prior to December 31, 2017 benefit from an 80% discount on transmission and distribution tariffs for the first ten years of operation and 50% thereafter. Wind plants injecting up to 30 MW into the grid are also eligible for 50% discounts. 
Special public funding. Subject to certain limitations, BNDES may finance up to 70% of all renewable energy power plants investments at reduced rates. Repayment of such loans may only commence once construction of the energy plant has finished and the plant is operative. BNDES also provides special public funding for manufacturers willing to commence Brazilian productions of the supply chain in connection with the renewable energy industry. 
24

Research and development investment. All generators, except hydro-electric generators with installed capacity under 30 MW, thermoelectric generators with installed capacity under 5 MW, biomass generators, solar generators and wind energy generators, must invest at least 1.0% of their net revenue in research and development facilities. 
India 
Solar power plants
In 2010, the Indian government launched its flagship solar initiative known as the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (the “National Solar Mission”). The National Solar Mission establishes a target of 100 GW of installed solar capacity by 2022 and stipulates the implementation and achievement of this target in multiple phases.
Solar power plants in India are set up under state solar policies or under the National Solar Mission. Capacity allocation under the National Solar Mission is staggered and through competitive bidding. Competitive bidding under the National Solar Mission is conducted using one the following schemes: (a) a bundling scheme, under which relatively expensive solar power is bundled with cheaper thermal power and sold to distribution utilities at a more affordable tariff; and (b) a viability gap funding scheme, under which viability gap funding is made available to project developers to subsidize the project cost.
Phase I of the National Solar Mission focused on promoting the development of grid-connected solar power capacity of 1,000 MW and mandated that NTPC Vidyut Vyapur Nigam Limited (“NVVN”) serve as the offtake counterparty to purchase the solar power under 25-year PPAs with solar power producers. NVVN is a wholly owned subsidiary of NTPC Limited, which is approximately 70% owned by the Indian national government. NVVN purchases the solar power from a solar power plant as a trading licensee, thereby minimizing the credit risk to the solar power plant. The tariff levels for Phase I were determined based on a competitive bidding process subject to a cap determined by the CERC under the bundling scheme.
In 2013, the Indian government approved the scheme for the development of 750 MW of grid-connected solar power capacity as part of Batch I of Phase II of the National Solar Mission and mandated that SECI serve as the offtake counterparty to purchase the solar power under 25-year PPAs with the solar power producers. In the Batch I of Phase II, the power is purchased by SECI at a fixed levelized tariff of INR 5.45/kWh (or INR 4.75/kWh in case of power plants utilizing accelerated depreciation). The solar power plant is entitled to receive viability gap funding support in an amount determined through a competitive bidding process. Such payment is made to the solar power plant over a five-year period from the date such solar plant commences operations and is funded by India’s National Clean Energy Fund, which is financed through a tax on coal used in India.
The Indian government had earlier proposed to set up 15,000 MW of solar projects through NTPC Limited/NVVN in three tranches: (a) 3,000 MW under the bundling scheme; (b) 5,000 MW with some support from the Indian government, the amount of which was to be decided based on results under the bundling scheme; and (c) 7,000 MW that will be implemented without any financial support from the Indian government. While guidelines for capacity addition for the first tranche were issued as Batch II of Phase II of the National Solar Mission in March 2015, the Indian government has sought to move away from the bunding scheme, and it is not clear when bidding pursuant to the second and third tranche will be conducted.
The Indian government is now focused on projects based on viability gap funding and, to further this objective, in August 2015 and March 2016 the Indian government issued guidelines for implementation of Batch III and Batch IV of Phase II of the National Solar Mission, consisting of 2,000 MW and 5,000 MW of capacity, respectively. Batch III and Batch IV are currently being implemented by SECI under the viability gap funding scheme.
In addition to the National Solar Mission, various Indian states have also initiated procurement of power from solar power plants through competitive bidding. In April 2015, Telangana issued bid documents for procurement of 2,000 MW of capacity. Similarly, Karnataka, in its latest solar policy, has made it mandatory for distribution utilities to purchase power from solar power plants with a capacity of 3 MW or above under the competitive bidding regime. 
Wind power plants 
Until recently, procurement of wind power was undertaken only through state specific wind policies; however, the Indian government is now promoting procurement of wind power on competitive basis at the national level, similar to procurement under the National Solar Mission. Several state policies provide for various incentives, such as exemption in payment of electricity duty, reduction of VAT, providing land at concessional lease rentals, and reduced wheeling and transmission charges. Additionally, an excise duty exemption is also available on wind operated electricity generators and concessional custom duty is applicable on import of specified components of wind turbines, subject to fulfillment of prescribed conditions. Until earlier this year, MNRE provided generation based incentives (up to INR 0.50/kWh) for grid connected wind 
25

power plants, in addition to the preferential tariffs approved by SERCs. However, such generation based incentives have now been discontinued for projects commissioned after March 31, 2017. 
To further optimize India’s wind power resources, MNRE has introduced a series of important policy measures such as the Draft Guidelines for Procurement of Wind Power through Competitive Bidding 2016, National Offshore Wind Energy Policy 2015, Guidelines for Onshore Wind Power Projects 2016, Draft National Wind-Solar Hybrid Policy 2016 and Policy for Repowering of the Wind Power Projects 2016. The Indian government has also recently conducted a competitive bid process for the development of wind power plants with a cumulative capacity of 1,000 MW and is in the process of conducting another round of bidding for an additional 1,000 MW of wind energy. This highlights a significant shift in the wind industry in the country, as until last year electricity from wind power plants was only sold at tariffs determined by the electricity regulatory commissions as opposed to tariffs determined through a competitive bidding process.
All renewable energy power plants
India’s National Tariff Policy 2006 requires the SERCs to fix a minimum percentage of the electricity that must be purchased by utilities operating in their jurisdiction from renewable energy generators (such as solar power plants), taking into account availability of such resources in the region and its impact on retail tariffs and procurement by distribution companies at preferential tariffs. This obligation to purchase electricity from renewable sources is known as a renewable purchase obligation (“RPO”). This policy was amended in January 2011 to prescribe a minimum solar specific RPO of 0.25% in 2012 to be increased to 3% by 2022. States such as Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Goa have fixed solar power RPO requirements at levels above the minimum level prescribed by the National Tariff Policy 2006. The National Tariff Policy, 2006 was amended effective January 28, 2016 and, inter alia, directs the SERCs to reserve a minimum percentage for purchase of solar energy such that it reaches 8% of total consumption of energy, excluding hydro power, by March 2022 or as notified by the Indian government from time to time. The National Tariff Policy also seeks to exempt inter-state transmission charges and losses for wind and solar power for such period as is notified by the Indian government. Pursuant to the National Tariff Policy, the Ministry of Power has waived the inter-state transmission charges and losses of the electricity generated from wind and solar power for a specified period.
In 2010, the CERC implemented regulations designed to facilitate the development of a power market from non-conventional energy sources by issuing transferable and salable credit certificates. These regulations facilitate fungibility and inter-state transactions of renewable energy by establishing a mechanism through which a market-based instrument can be traded freely and provide a means for fulfillment of renewable purchase obligations by India’s utilities and open access consumers. Although these regulations established the necessary framework, the market for such renewable energy credits has not developed widely and is not liquid. None of our Indian power plants is participating in the renewable energy credit certificate programs at this time.
Further, while the Indian government is proposing massive capacity addition for renewable energy, tax incentives are on the decline, with accelerated depreciation being reduced to 40% and generation based incentives being eliminated entirely. Separately, a minimum alternative tax (generally at approximately 20%) calculated based on book profits is still applicable in respect of renewable energy power plants.
South Africa
In August 2011, South Africa’s Department of Energy (“SA DOE”) launched the REIPPP program, which requires renewable energy developers to bid on a tariff level and the identified socio-economic development objectives of the SA DOE. The REIPPP program has gone through six successive rounds of bidding, which includes the additional bidding round (known as the expedited round) with preferred bidders expected to be announced in the near future. The REIPPP program has been designed to procure a target of 12,825 MW of renewable energy with units of power (in MW) allocated to each technology. Statistics related to the first five rounds of the REIPPP program indicate that a total of 92 developers have secured contracts to produce renewable energy with a combined nameplate capacity of 6,327 MW. Of the total procured capacity under the first five rounds, 2,292 MW is for photovoltaic solar power plants, 0.6 MW is for concentrated solar power plants, 3,357 MW is for wind power plants, and the remainder relates to other renewable energy sources.
Each bid is evaluated under the REIPPP program with an evaluation weighting split 70% on the proposed tariff amount and 30% on the specified economic development criteria, the latter of which includes employment, local content and management control, ownership characteristics, socio-economic spending and smaller enterprise development initiatives. The tariff payable by the offtaker for the particular power plant is determined based on the proposed tariff during the bidding process. Each winning bidder under the REIPPP program will:

• | enter into a 20-year PPA with Eskom that creates an obligation for Eskom to pay the project company the agreed tariff for power provided by the facility; and

26


• | enter into a 20-year Implementation Agreement with the SA DOE that creates an obligation for the power plant to satisfy its identified economic development objectives.

Under the REIPPP program, the South African government guarantees the payment obligations of Eskom under the PPAs entered into with renewable energy producers in defined circumstances. These guarantee arrangements, along with the support package adopted by the National Treasury on September 14, 2014, has facilitated private sector development as financing sources and investors have been willing to accept sovereign country risk without requiring political risk insurance, as would be the case in virtually every other African jurisdiction. Based on the sovereign guarantee and support package, we believe that Eskom will be a low risk offtake counterparty purchaser with a similar credit profile to our other customers. In addition, an accelerated depreciation allowance (50% in the first year of use, 30% in the second, and 20% in the third) applies to the cost of selected movable machinery and articles used in the construction of the solar and wind farms.
Financial Information about Segments
We have two reportable segments, solar and wind. These segments comprise the Company’s entire portfolio of power plants and are determined based on the management approach, which means that the scope of the reportable segments is derived from the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance. Corporate expenses include general and administrative expenses, acquisition costs, formation and offering related fees and expenses, interest expense on corporate indebtedness, stock-based compensation and depreciation, accretion and amortization expense. All operating revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 were earned by our reportable segments from external customers in Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, South Africa, Thailand and Uruguay, all operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were earned by our reportable segments from external customers in Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, South Africa and Thailand and all operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were earned by our reportable segments from external customers in China, India, Malaysia, South Africa and Thailand.
Customer Concentration
For the year ended December 31, 2016, Camara de Comercializacao de Energia Eletrica (Salvador and Bahia) and Eskom Holdings SOC Limited (Boshof, Soutpan, Witkop), accounted for 33% and 26% of our consolidated operating revenues, net, respectively.
Employees
Historically, with the exception of certain of our operations in China, the Company did not have any employees. The personnel that managed our operations (other than our Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer, Peter Blackmore, our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Studebaker, and our Interim Chief Accounting Officer, David Rawden) were employees of SunEdison and their services were provided to the Company under the Management Services Agreement with SunEdison or project level asset management and O&M services agreements. In a number of cases, the personnel that provided services to us also provided services to SunEdison and/or TerraForm Power during the same periods.
In light of the SunEdison Bankruptcy, we engaged in contingency planning to identify, and to be prepared to retain, key personnel to ensure continuity of the Company’s corporate and project level operations. As part of our efforts to create a stand-alone organization, we identified, and established a retention program for, key employees. On April 7, 2016 and April 21, 2016, the Conflicts Committee approved retention awards to encourage certain employees of SunEdison who carry out services for the Company, including certain officers of the Company, to remain employed by SunEdison and continue to provide services to the Company during and after the potential (as of April 7) and actual (as of April 21) SunEdison Bankruptcy. 
In late 2016, the Company offered employment to such employees to ensure continuity of corporate and project level operations. As of January 1, 2017, substantially all employees at both the corporate and project levels who were previously employed by SunEdison were hired directly by the Company. As such, the Company no longer relies upon SunEdison for personnel to manage and operate our business or our power plants. While a number of our executive officers, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer, Peter Blackmore, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Rebecca Cranna, our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Studebaker, and our Interim Chief Accounting Officer, David Rawden, continue to serve in the same functions for TerraForm Power, most other officers and employees provide services exclusively to the Company.
As of May 31, 2017, the Company had 124 employees, the substantial majority of which were located outside the United States in the countries where our power plants are located.
