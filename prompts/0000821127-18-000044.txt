ITEM 1. BUSINESS
I.General
Boston Private Financial Holdings, Inc. (the “Company,” “BPFH,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated on September 2, 1987, under the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts. On July 1, 1988, the Company registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), and became the parent holding company (the “Holding Company”) of Boston Private Bank & Trust Company (the “Bank” or “Boston Private Bank”), a trust company chartered by The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”). 
We are a private banking and wealth management company that offers a full range of private banking and wealth management services to high net worth individuals, families, businesses, and select institutions through a financial umbrella that helps to preserve, grow, and transfer assets over the financial lifetime of a client through our four functional segments: Private Banking, Wealth Management and Trust, Investment Management, and Wealth Advisory. Each reportable segment reflects the services provided by the Company to a distinct segment of the wealth management market as described below.
Private Banking
The Private Banking segment has one affiliate, Boston Private Bank. The Private Banking segment primarily operates in three geographic markets: New England, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Southern California. The Private Banking segment is principally engaged in providing private banking services to high net worth individuals, privately-owned businesses and partnerships, and nonprofit organizations. In addition, the Private Banking segment is an active provider of financing for affordable housing, first-time homebuyers, economic development, social services, community revitalization and small businesses.
Wealth Management and Trust
The Wealth Management and Trust segment is comprised of Boston Private Wealth LLC (“Boston Private Wealth”), an independent registered investment adviser (“RIA”), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank. This segment also includes the trust operations of Boston Private Bank. Boston Private Wealth was formed from the combination of the Bank’s wealth management business and those of Banyan Partners, LLC (“Banyan”), which the Bank acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014. The segment provides comprehensive wealth management solutions for high net worth individuals and families, including customized investment solutions, wealth planning, trust, and family office services. The Wealth Management and Trust segment operates in New England; South Florida; California; and Madison, Wisconsin. 
Investment Management
The Investment Management segment currently has two affiliates: Dalton, Greiner, Hartman, Maher & Co., LLC (“DGHM”), and Anchor Capital Advisors LLC (“Anchor”), both of which are RIAs (together, DGHM and Anchor are referred to as the “Investment Managers”). The Investment Managers serve the needs of pension funds, endowments, trusts, foundations and select institutions, mutual funds and high net worth individuals and their families throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and abroad. The Investment Managers specialize in value-driven equity portfolios with products across the capitalization spectrum. The specific mix of products, services and clientele varies between affiliates. The Investment Managers are located in New England and New York, with one affiliate administrative office in South Florida.
In December 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its entire ownership interest in Anchor in a transaction that will result in Anchor being majority-owned by members of its management team. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. This transaction has been approved by the Company’s board of directors and is subject to obtaining client consents, Anchor raising debt financing, and customary closing conditions. Anchor’s assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale at December 31, 2017 which are included within other assets and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, respectively. 
Wealth Advisory
The Wealth Advisory segment has two affiliates: KLS Professional Advisors Group, LLC (“KLS”), and Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough, LLC (“BOS”), both of which are wealth management firms and RIAs (together, the “Wealth Advisors”). The Wealth Advisors provide comprehensive, planning-based financial strategies to high net worth individuals and their families, and nonprofit institutions. The services the firms offer include fee-only financial planning, tax planning, tax 
 1

preparation, estate and insurance planning, retirement planning, charitable planning and intergenerational gifting and succession planning. The Wealth Advisors manage investments covering a wide range of asset classes for both taxable and tax-exempt portfolios. The Wealth Advisors are located in New York, Southern California, and Northern California.
Collectively, the Wealth Management and Trust, Investment Management, and Wealth Advisory segments are referred to as the “Wealth and Investment” businesses.
For revenue, net income, assets, and other financial information for each of the Company’s reportable segments, see Part II. Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20: Reportable Segments.”
The Company’s Internet address is www.bostonprivate.com. The Company makes available on or through its Internet website, without charge, its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Company’s reports filed with, or furnished to, the SEC are also available at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. The quarterly earnings release conference call can also be accessed from the Company’s website. Press releases are also maintained on the Company’s website for one year. Information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this document and should not be considered part of this Report.
II.Acquisitions, Asset Sales, and Divestitures
In December 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its entire ownership interest in Anchor in a transaction that will result in Anchor being majority-owned by members of its management team. The Company will receive at closing approximately $32 million of cash and future revenue share payments that, at signing, had a net present value of approximately $15 million, subject to purchase price adjustments. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment test for Anchor resulted in a fourth quarter of 2017 goodwill impairment charge of $24.9 million. The Company also recorded a loss on sale of $1.3 million representing estimated closing costs upon completion of the sale. Income tax expense of approximately $11.4 million will be recorded at the time of the closing of the transaction as a result of a book to tax basis difference associated with nondeductible goodwill. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. The estimated loss on sale as well as the income tax expense could change depending upon the book value of Anchor at the time of closing. This transaction has been approved by the Company’s board of directors and is subject to obtaining client consents, Anchor raising debt financing, and customary closing conditions. The rationale for the sale is to focus the Company’s resources in businesses where we can offer holistic financial advice, along with integrated wealth management, trust, and private banking capabilities. Upon closing, this transaction will also generate additional capital for us to reinvest in a more focused Company.
In November 2016, the Bank sold two of its Southern California offices, one located in Granada Hills, CA and the other located in Burbank, CA, together with approximately $104 million of deposits. The rationale for the sale was to better position the Company’s resources within the Southern California market.
In October 2014, Boston Private Bank acquired Banyan. Banyan and the wealth management operations from Boston Private Bank were combined to form Boston Private Wealth, which now operates in the Wealth Management and Trust reportable segment of the Company along with the trust operations of Boston Private Bank. Boston Private Wealth is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boston Private Bank.
In 2009, the Company divested its interest in Westfield Capital Management Company, LP, formerly known as Westfield Capital Management Company, LLC (“Westfield”). The Company retained a 12.5% share in Westfield’s revenues (up to an annual maximum of $11.6 million) through December 2017 subject to certain conditions. The Company defers gains related to these payments until determinable. Such revenue share payments are included in net income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for the period in which the revenue is recognized. After the December 2017 payments are received in the first quarter of 2018, the Company will not receive additional net income from Westfield. 
For further details relating to the Company’s divestitures, see Part II. Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3: Acquisitions, Asset Sales, and Divestitures.”

III.    Competition
The Company operates in the highly competitive private banking and wealth management marketplaces. In the private banking industry, the Bank encounters competition from larger national and regional commercial banking organizations, savings banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions and non-bank financial service companies, which may offer lower interest rates on loans and higher interest rates on deposits. The Bank’s competitors also include major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services, including through the Internet. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries, among other industry sectors, in the transfer of funds among parties. To compete effectively, the Bank relies on local promotional activity, personal contacts by officers, directors, and employees, customized service, and the Bank’s reputation within the communities that it serves.
In the wealth management and trust industry, the Company competes with a wide variety of firms, including national and regional financial services firms, commercial banks and trust companies, mutual fund companies, investment advisory firms, stock brokerage firms, accounting firms, and law firms. There has also been a trend toward online internet financial services and financial services that are based on mobile applications or automated processes as clients increasingly seek to manage their investment portfolios digitally. This is leading to increased utilization of “robo” adviser platforms. The Company believes that the ability of its Wealth Management and Trust segment to compete effectively with other firms is dependent upon the quality and level of service, personal relationships, and investment performance. 
The Company’s principal competitors with respect to investment management services are primarily commercial banks and trust companies, mutual fund companies, investment advisory firms, stock brokerage firms, other financial companies, online financial services companies, and law firms. The Company has also faced competition in recent years from lower fee, passive investment strategies. Investment advisers that emphasize passive products have gained, and may continue to gain, market share from active managers like us, which could have a material impact on our business. The Company believes that its ability to compete effectively with other investment management firms is dependent upon its products, level of investment performance and client service, as well as the marketing and distribution of the investment products.
In the wealth advisory industry, the Company competes with a wide variety of firms, including national and regional financial services firms, accounting firms, trust companies, and law firms. As in the Wealth Management and Trust segment, the Wealth Advisory segment has seen a trend toward the utilization of online financial services and increased utilization of “robo” adviser platforms. The Company believes that the ability of its wealth advisory affiliates to compete effectively with other firms is dependent upon the quality and level of service, personal relationships, and investment performance.
IV.    Employees
At December 31, 2017, the Company had 925 employees. The Company’s employees are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and the Company believes its employee relations are good.
V. Supervision and Regulation 
The following discussion addresses elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. This regulatory framework is intended primarily to protect the safety and soundness of depository institutions, the federal deposit insurance system, and depositors, rather than the shareholders of a bank holding company such as the Company. 
As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. The Company is also subject to examination and supervision by the Massachusetts Division of Banks (the “MDOB”) under Massachusetts law. As a Massachusetts-chartered trust company and Federal Reserve member bank, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks (the “Commissioner”) and the Federal Reserve. The Bank’s California branches are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the California Department of Business Oversight Division of Financial Institutions (the “DFI”). 
The Company’s Wealth Management and Trust, Investment Management, and Wealth Advisory segments are subject to extensive regulation by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and state securities regulators.
The following is a summary of certain aspects of the various statutes and regulations applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. This summary is not a comprehensive analysis of all applicable laws, and is qualified by reference to the full text of statutes and regulations referenced below.
 3

Regulation of the Company
The Company is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, which has the authority, among other things, to order bank holding companies to cease and desist from unsafe or unsound banking practices; to assess civil money penalties; and to order termination of non-banking activities or termination of ownership and control of a non-banking subsidiary by a bank holding company.
Source of Strength. Under the BHCA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the Company is required to serve as a source of financial strength for the Bank. This support may be required at times when the Company may not have the resources to provide support to the Bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a bank subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. 
Acquisitions and Activities. The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, without prior approval of the Federal Reserve, from acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank; acquiring control of a bank; merging or consolidating with another bank holding company; or acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the acquiring bank holding company would control more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of such other bank or bank holding company. 
The BHCA also prohibits a bank holding company from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiary banks. However, a bank holding company may engage in and may own shares of companies engaged in certain activities that the Federal Reserve determines to be closely related to banking or managing and controlling banks. 
Limitations on Acquisitions of Company Common Stock. The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting securities of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act would constitute the acquisition of control of a bank holding company. 
In addition, the BHCA prohibits any company from acquiring control of a bank or bank holding company without first having obtained the approval of the Federal Reserve. Among other circumstances, under the BHCA, a company has control of a bank or bank holding company if the company owns, controls or holds with power to vote 25% or more of a class of voting securities of the bank or bank holding company; controls in any manner the election of a majority of directors or trustees of the bank or bank holding company; or the Federal Reserve has determined, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the company has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or bank holding company. 
Regulation of the Bank
The Bank is subject to the regulation, supervision, and examination of the Commissioner and the Federal Reserve, and with respect to its California branches, the DFI. The Bank is also subject to regulations issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, as enforced by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve may also directly examine the other subsidiaries of the Company. The enforcement powers available to federal and state banking regulators include, among other things, the ability to issue cease and desist or removal orders, to terminate insurance of deposits, to assess civil money penalties, to issue directives to increase capital, to place the bank into receivership, and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. 
Deposit Insurance. Deposit obligations of the Bank are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) up to $250,000 per separately insured depositor for deposits held in the same right and capacity. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”), as amended by the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, requires the FDIC to take steps as may be necessary to cause the ratio of deposit insurance reserves to estimated insured deposits - the designated reserve ratio - to reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020, and it mandates that the reserve ratio designated by the FDIC for any year thereafter may not be less than 1.35%. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act required that, in setting assessments, the FDIC offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% on banks with less than $10 billion in assets. To satisfy these requirements, on March 15, 2016, the FDIC’s Board of Directors approved a final rule to increase the DIF’s reserve ratio to the statutorily required minimum ratio of 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The final rule imposes on large banks a surcharge of 4.5 basis points of their assessment base, after making certain adjustments. Large banks, which are generally banks with $10 billion or more in assets, will pay quarterly surcharges in addition to their regular risk-based assessments. Overall regular risk-based assessment rates will decline once the reserve ratio reaches 1.15 percent. Small banks, such as the Bank, will receive credits to offset the portion of their assessments that help to raise the reserve ratio from 1.15 
 4

percent to 1.35 percent. After the reserve ratio reaches 1.38 percent, the FDIC will automatically apply a small bank’s credits to reduce its regular assessment up to the entire amount of the assessment. The revised deposit insurance assessment pricing became effective on July 1, 2016.
Deposit premiums are based on assets. To determine its deposit insurance premium, the Bank computes the base amount of its average consolidated assets less its average tangible equity (defined as the amount of Tier 1 capital) and the applicable assessment rate. On April 26, 2016, the FDIC’s Board of Directors adopted a final rule that changed the manner in which deposit insurance assessment rates are calculated for established small banks, generally those banks with less than $10 billion of assets that have been insured for at least five years. Under this method, each of seven financial ratios and a weighted average of CAMELS composite ratings will be multiplied by a corresponding pricing multiplier. The sum of these products will be added to a uniform amount, with the resulting sum being an institution’s initial base assessment rate (subject to minimum or maximum assessment rates based on a bank’s CAMELS composite rating). This method takes into account various measures, including an institution’s leverage ratio, brokered deposit ratio, one year asset growth, the ratio of net income before taxes to total assets and considerations related to asset quality. Under the small bank pricing rule, beginning with the first assessment period after June 30, 2016, where the DIF’s reserve ratio has reached 1.15% assessments for established small banks with a CAMELS rating of 1 or 2 will range from 1.5 to 16 basis points after adjustments, while assessment rates for established small institutions with a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 5 may range from 11 to 30 basis points, after adjustment. Assessments for established banks with a CAMELS rating of 3 will range from 3 to 30 basis points. The Company’s FDIC deposit insurance premium declined 32% in the first quarter that the new rules were enacted. 
The FDIC has the power to adjust deposit insurance assessment rates at any time. In addition, under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices; is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations; or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. For 2017, the FDIC insurance expense for the Bank was $3.0 million. 
Acquisitions and Branching. Prior approval from the Commissioner and the Federal Reserve is required in order for the Bank to acquire another bank or establish a new branch office. Well capitalized and well managed banks may acquire other banks in any state, subject to certain deposit concentration limits and other conditions, pursuant to the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes a state-chartered bank, such as the Bank, to establish new branches on an interstate basis to the same extent a bank chartered by the host state may establish branches.
Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks. Section 24 of the FDIA generally limits the types of equity investments that FDIC-insured state-chartered member banks, such as the Bank, may make and the kinds of activities in which such banks may engage, as a principal, to those that are permissible for national banks. Further, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLBA”) permits state banks, to the extent permitted under state law, to engage - through “financial subsidiaries” - in certain activities which are permissible for subsidiaries of a financial holding company. In order to form a financial subsidiary, a state-chartered bank must be well capitalized, and must comply with certain capital deduction, risk management and affiliate transaction rules, among other requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve Act provides that state member banks are subject to the same restrictions with respect to purchasing, selling, underwriting and holding of investment securities as national banks.
Lending Restrictions. Federal law limits a bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. The terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank’s capital. The Dodd-Frank Act explicitly provides that an extension of credit to an insider includes credit exposure arising from a derivatives transaction, repurchase agreement, reverse repurchase agreement, securities lending transaction or securities borrowing transaction. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act requires that asset sale transactions with insiders must be on market terms, and if the transaction represents more than 10% of the capital and surplus of the Bank, approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Bank. 
Brokered Deposits. Section 29 of the FDIA and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of an insured depository institution to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the institution’s capital category is “well capitalized” or, with the FDIC’s approval, “adequately capitalized.” Depository institutions that have brokered deposits in excess of 10% of total assets will be subject to increased FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments. However, for institutions that are well capitalized and have a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2, reciprocal deposits are deducted from brokered deposits.
 5

Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires the Federal Reserve to evaluate the Bank’s performance in helping to meet the credit needs of the entire communities it serves, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with its safe and sound banking operations, and to take this record into consideration when evaluating certain applications. The Federal Reserve’s CRA regulations are generally based upon objective criteria of the performance of institutions under three key assessment tests: (i) a lending test, to evaluate the institution’s record of making loans in its service areas; (ii) an investment test, to evaluate the institution’s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses; and (iii) a service test, to evaluate the institution’s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs, and other offices. The Bank’s most recent performance evaluation from the FDIC, which was the Bank’s primary federal regulator at the time of the evaluation, was a “satisfactory” rating. Massachusetts has also enacted a similar statute that requires the Commissioner to evaluate the performance of the Bank in helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community and to take that record into account in considering certain applications.
Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness 
Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve has issued risk-based and leverage capital rules applicable to U.S. banking organizations such as the Company and the Bank. These rules are intended to reflect the relationship between the banking organization’s capital and the degree of risk associated with its operations based on transactions recorded on-balance sheet as well as off-balance sheet. The Federal Reserve may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels discussed below, due to the banking organization’s financial condition or actual or anticipated growth.
The capital adequacy guidelines define qualifying capital instruments and specify minimum amounts of capital as a percentage of assets that banking organizations are required to maintain. Common equity Tier 1 capital generally includes common stock and related surplus, retained earnings and, in certain cases and subject to certain limitations, minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, other non-qualifying intangible assets and certain other deductions. Tier 1 capital for banks and bank holding companies generally consists of the sum of common equity Tier 1 capital, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and related surplus, and, in certain cases and subject to limitations, minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries that do not qualify as common equity Tier 1 capital, less certain deductions. Tier 2 capital generally consists of hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt securities, cumulative perpetual preferred stock, term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock, and, subject to limitations, allowances for loan losses. The sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital less certain required deductions represents qualifying total risk-based capital. Prior to the effectiveness of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies were permitted to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock in Tier 1 capital, subject to limitations. However, the Federal Reserve’s capital rule applicable to bank holding companies permanently grandfathered non-qualifying capital instruments, including trust preferred securities, issued before May 19, 2010 by depository institution holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital. In addition, under rules that became effective January 1, 2015, accumulated other comprehensive income (positive or negative) must be reflected in Tier 1 capital; however, the Company and the Bank were permitted to make a one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from capital. The Company and the Bank have made this election.
Under the capital rules, risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 risk-based capital, and total risk-based capital, respectively, by risk-weighted assets. Assets and off-balance sheet credit equivalents are assigned to one of several categories of risk-weights, based primarily on relative credit risk. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 risk-based capital by average assets less certain items such as goodwill and intangible assets, as permitted under the capital rules.
Under the Federal Reserve’s capital rules applicable to the Company and the Bank, the Company and the Bank are each required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5%, a minimum total Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6.0%, a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8% and a minimum leverage ratio of 4%. Additionally, subject to a transition schedule, these rules require an institution to establish a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital in an amount above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for “adequately capitalized” institutions equal to 2.5% of total risk weighted assets, or face restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, pay discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases. 
Under the Federal Reserve’s rules, a Federal Reserve supervised institution, such as the Bank, is considered “well capitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater; (iii) a common Tier 1 equity ratio of at least 6.5% or greater, (iv) a leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or greater; and (iv) is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a 
 6

specific capital level for any capital measure. The Bank is currently considered “well capitalized” under all regulatory definitions.
Generally, a bank, upon receiving notice that it is not adequately capitalized (i.e., that it is “undercapitalized”), becomes subject to the prompt corrective action provisions of Section 38 of FDIA that, for example, (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees, (ii) require that its federal bank regulator monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital, (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan, (iv) restrict the growth of the institution’s assets and (v) require prior regulatory approval of certain expansion proposals. A bank that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guarantee by each company that controls the bank. A bank that is “critically undercapitalized” (i.e., has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%) will be subject to further restrictions, and generally will be placed in conservatorship or receivership within 90 days.
Current capital rules do not establish standards for determining whether a bank holding company is well capitalized. However, for purposes of processing regulatory applications and notices, the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation Y provides that a bank holding company is considered “well capitalized” if (i) on a consolidated basis, the bank holding company maintains a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater; (ii) on a consolidated basis, the bank holding company maintains a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater; and (iii) the bank holding company is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.
Safety and Soundness Standards. The FDIA requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe standards, by regulations or guidelines, relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and compensation, fees and benefits, and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, these guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In addition, the federal banking agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order restricting asset growth, requiring an institution to increase its ratio of tangible equity to assets or directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the FDIA. See “-Regulatory Capital Requirements” above. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties. 
Dividend Restrictions
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and our other subsidiaries. The revenue of the Company (on a parent-only basis) is derived primarily from dividends paid to it by those other entities. The right of the Company, and consequently the right of shareholders of the Company, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of the Bank and our other subsidiaries through the payment of such dividends or otherwise is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the Bank (including depositors) and our other subsidiaries, except to the extent that certain claims of the Company in a creditor capacity may be recognized.
Restrictions on Bank Holding Company Dividends. The Federal Reserve has the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if such payment is deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for bank holding companies to pay dividends unless the bank holding company’s net income over the preceding year is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Further, under the Federal Reserve’s capital rule, the Company’s ability to pay dividends is restricted if it does not maintain capital above the conservation buffer. See “-Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness -Regulatory Capital Requirements” above.
Restrictions on Bank Dividends. The Federal Reserve has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Federal law also prohibits the payment of dividends by a bank that will result in the bank failing to meet its applicable capital requirements on a pro forma basis. In addition, a state bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System may not declare or 
 7

pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during the calendar year, including the proposed dividend, exceeds the sum of the bank’s net income (as reportable in its Reports of Condition and Income) during the current calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two calendar years, unless the dividend has not been objected to by the FRB following receipt of advance notice. A state member bank may not declare and pay a dividend that would exceed its individual profits (as reportable on its Reports of Condition and Income) unless it has provided advance notice to the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve has not objected. Payment of dividends by a bank is also restricted pursuant to various state regulatory limitations.
Certain Transactions by Bank Holding Companies with their Affiliates
There are various statutory restrictions on the extent to which bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries may borrow, obtain credit from or otherwise engage in “covered transactions” with their insured depository institution subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the definition of affiliate to include an investment fund for which the depository institution or one of its affiliates is an investment adviser. An insured depository institution (and its subsidiaries) may not lend money to, or engage in covered transactions with, its non-depository institution affiliates if the aggregate amount of covered transactions outstanding involving the bank, plus the proposed transaction exceeds the following limits: (i) in the case of any one such affiliate, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 10% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution; and (ii) in the case of all affiliates, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 20% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution. For this purpose, “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate; a purchase of or investment in securities issued by an affiliate; a purchase of assets from an affiliate unless exempted by the Federal Reserve; the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any person or company; the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate; securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate; or a derivatives transaction with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate. Covered transactions are also subject to certain collateral security requirements. Covered transactions as well as other types of transactions between a bank and a bank holding company must be on market terms and not otherwise unduly favorable to the holding company or an affiliate of the holding company. Moreover, Section 106 of the BHCA provides that, to further competition, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property of any kind, or furnishing of any service.
Consumer Protection Regulation
The Company and the Bank are subject to federal and state laws designed to protect consumers and prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive business practices, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Housing Act, Home Ownership Protection Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACT Act”), the GLBA, the Truth in Lending Act, the CRA, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, National Flood Insurance Act and various state law counterparts. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must interact with clients when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which has the responsibility for making rules and regulations under the federal consumer protection laws relating to financial products and services. The CFPB also has a broad mandate to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts and practices and is specifically empowered to require certain disclosures to consumers and draft model disclosure forms. Failure to comply with consumer protection laws and regulations can subject financial institutions to enforcement actions, fines and other penalties. The Federal Reserve will examine the Bank for compliance with CFPB rules and will enforce CFPB rules with respect to the Bank.
Mortgage Reform. The Dodd-Frank Act prescribes certain standards that mortgage lenders must consider before making a residential mortgage loan, including verifying a borrower’s ability to repay such mortgage loan, and allows borrowers to assert violations of certain provisions of the Truth in Lending Act as a defense to foreclosure proceedings. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, prepayment penalties are prohibited for certain mortgage transactions and creditors are prohibited from financing insurance policies in connection with a residential mortgage loan or home equity line of credit. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits mortgage originators from receiving compensation based on the terms of residential mortgage loans and generally limits the ability of a mortgage originator to be compensated by others if compensation is received from a consumer. The Dodd-Frank Act requires mortgage lenders to make additional disclosures prior to the extension of credit, in each billing statement and for negative amortization loans and hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. 
Privacy and Customer Information Security. The GLBA requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. In general, the Bank must provide its clients with an initial and annual disclosure that explains its policies and procedures 
 8

regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information, and, except as otherwise required or permitted by law, the Bank is prohibited from disclosing such information unless otherwise provided in such policies and procedures. However, an annual disclosure is not required to be provided by a financial institution if the financial institution only discloses information under exceptions from GLBA that do not require an opt out to be provided and if there has been no change in its privacy policies and practices since its most recent disclosure provided to consumers. The GLBA also requires that the Bank develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of client information (as defined under GLBA), to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any client. The Bank is also required to send a notice to clients whose “sensitive information” has been compromised if unauthorized use of the information is “reasonably possible.” Most states, including the states in which the Bank operates, have enacted legislation concerning breaches of data security and the duties of the Bank in response to a data breach. In addition, Massachusetts has promulgated data security regulations with respect to personal information of Massachusetts residents. Pursuant to the FACT Act, the Bank has developed and implemented a written identity theft prevention program to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of certain accounts or certain existing accounts. Additionally, the FACT Act amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to generally prohibit a person from using information received from an affiliate to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer, unless the consumer is given notice and a reasonable opportunity and a reasonable and simple method to opt out of the making of such solicitations. 
Anti-Money Laundering 
The Bank Secrecy Act. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), a financial institution is required to have systems in place to detect certain transactions, based on the size and nature of the transaction. Financial institutions are generally required to report to the U.S. Treasury any cash transactions involving more than $10,000. In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for any transaction or series of transactions that involve more than $5,000 and which the financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or has no lawful purpose. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA PATRIOT Act”), which amended the BSA, together with the implementing regulations of various federal regulatory agencies, has caused financial institutions, such as the Bank, to adopt and implement additional policies or amend existing policies and procedures with respect to, among other things, anti-money laundering compliance, suspicious activity, currency transaction reporting, customer identity verification and customer risk analysis. In evaluating an application under Section 3 of the BHCA to acquire a bank or an application under the Bank Merger Act to merge banks or effect a purchase of assets and assumption of deposits and other liabilities, the applicable federal banking regulator must consider the anti-money laundering compliance record of both the applicant and the target. In addition, under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions are required to take steps to monitor their correspondent banking and private banking relationships as well as, if applicable, their relationships with “shell banks.” 
OFAC. The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These sanctions, which are administered by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial or other transactions relating to a sanctioned country, or with certain designated persons and entities; (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons); and (iii) restrictions on certain transactions with or involving certain persons or entities. Blocked assets (for example, property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the Company.
Regulation of Other Activities 
Investment Management, Wealth Advisory, and Wealth Management and Trust. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are registered with the SEC as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on RIAs, including fiduciary, recordkeeping, operational, and disclosure obligations. Certain Investment Management, Wealth Advisory, and Wealth Management and Trust subsidiaries of the Company are also subject to regulation under the securities laws and fiduciary laws of certain states.
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC to study the standard of care for brokers and investment advisers and report its findings to Congress. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act permits the SEC to impose a uniform standard of care on brokers and investment advisers based on the study’s findings. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC must also harmonize the enforcement of fiduciary standard violations under the Exchange Act and the Advisers Act. It is unclear how the studies and 
 9

rulemaking relating to the fiduciary duties of brokers and investment advisers will affect the Company and its Investment Management, Wealth Advisory, and Wealth Management and Trust subsidiaries.
Each of the mutual funds for which one or more of the Company’s Investment Management subsidiaries acts as sub-adviser is registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Shares of each such fund are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act, and the shares of each fund are qualified for sale (or exempt from such qualification) under the laws of each state and the District of Columbia to the extent such shares are sold in any of such jurisdictions. 
The Company, the Bank, and their subsidiaries are also subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as they are a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to certain of their clients. ERISA and the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibit certain transactions by the fiduciaries (and certain other related parties) to such plans. 
As sub-advisers to registered investment companies, the Company’s Investment Management subsidiaries are subject to requirements under the 1940 Act and related SEC regulations. Under provisions of the 1940 Act and Advisers Act governing advisory contracts, an assignment terminating the Company’s sub-advisory contract can occur as a result of the acquisition of a firm by the Company. 
The foregoing laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict certain subsidiaries of the Company from conducting their business in the event that they fail to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed in the event of such noncompliance include the suspension of individual employees; limitations on the business activities for specified periods of time; revocation of registration as an investment adviser, commodity trading adviser and/or other registrations; and other censures and fines. 
Volcker Rule Restrictions on Proprietary Trading and Sponsorship of Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banking organizations, such as the Company, from engaging in proprietary trading and from sponsoring and investing in hedge funds and private equity funds, except as permitted under certain circumstances, pursuant to a provision commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule.” Under the Dodd-Frank Act, proprietary trading generally means trading by a banking entity or its affiliate for its trading account. Hedge funds and private equity funds are described by the Dodd-Frank Act as funds that would be registered under the 1940 Act but for certain enumerated exemptions. The Volcker Rule restrictions apply to the Company, the Bank, and all of their subsidiaries and affiliates.
VI.Taxation
Federal Taxation
The Company and its incorporated affiliates are subject to federal income taxation generally applicable to corporations under the Code. In addition, the Bank is subject to Subchapter H of the Code, which provides specific rules for the treatment of securities, reserves for loan losses, and any common trust funds. 
The Company and its incorporated affiliates are members of an affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code and file a consolidated federal income tax return. Some of the advantages of filing a consolidated tax return include the avoidance of tax on intercompany distributions and the ability to offset operating and capital losses of one company against operating income and capital gains of another company. 
The Company’s taxable income includes its share of the taxable income or loss from its subsidiaries that are limited liability companies.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, (the “Tax Act”) was enacted by the U.S. government. The Tax Act includes significant changes to the Code, including amendments which significantly change the taxation of business entities. The most significant change that impacts the Company is the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and the elimination of Code Section 162(m)’s exemption for performance-based executive compensation, both of which are effective January 1, 2018. 
State and Local Taxation
The Company and its affiliates are subject to the tax rate established in the states in which they do business. Substantially all of the Company’s taxable state and local income is derived from Massachusetts, California, Florida, New York, and the City of New York. 
 10

The Massachusetts tax rate is 9.0% on taxable income apportioned to Massachusetts. Massachusetts’ taxable income is defined as federal taxable income subject to certain modifications. These modifications include a deduction for 95% of dividends received from entities in which the Company owns 15% or more of the voting stock, income from federally tax-exempt obligations and deductions for certain expenses allocated to federally tax-exempt obligations. 
The California tax rate is 8.84% for corporations that are not financial institutions and 10.84% for financial institutions. The California tax is on California taxable income, which is defined as federal taxable income subject to certain modifications. These modifications include income from federally tax-exempt obligations and deductions for certain expenses allocated to federally tax-exempt obligations.
The Florida tax rate is 5.5% on taxable income apportioned to Florida. Florida’s taxable income is defined as federal taxable income subject to certain modifications. These modifications include income from federally tax-exempt obligations and deductions for certain expenses allocated to federally tax-exempt obligations.
The New York state tax rate is 6.5% on taxable income apportioned to New York (subject to alternative minimum taxes that may be based on business capital or a fixed dollar minimum), plus a surcharge for business operations in the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation district. New York taxable income is defined as federal taxable income subject to certain modifications. These modifications include income from federally tax-exempt obligations and deductions for certain expenses allocated to federally tax-exempt obligations. Combined reporting requirements began in 2015. 
The New York City tax rate is 8.85% on taxable income apportioned to New York City (subject to alternative minimum taxes that may be based on business capital or a fixed dollar minimum). New York City taxable income is defined as federal taxable income subject to certain modifications.
