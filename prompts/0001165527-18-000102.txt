COMPANY OVERVIEW
 
Green Hygienics Holdings Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 12, 2008 as Silver Bay Resources Inc. and issued 55,000 shares of common stock on June 12, 2008 (after accounting for the forward and reverse splits detailed below) for cash of $20,000.   On June 30, 2010 the Company changed its name to Takedown Entertainment Inc and forward split its issued shares on the basis of five new shares for one old share (5:1) on the same date. On July 24, 2012 the Company changed its name to Green Hygienics Holdings Inc. and, on the same date, reverse split both its issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a two thousand old for one new basis (1:2000).
 
During 2008 the Company staked one mineral claim located 100 km northwest of Vancouver, British Columbia and acquired a molybdenum property comprised of one mineral claim located approximately 35 kilometers north of Vancouver, British Columbia. We did not proceed with further exploration of the mineral claims due to a determination that the results of our initial geological program did not generate investor interest in the claims and we were unable to finance further exploration. Mineral property costs of $20,000 were expensed during 2009. Both properties have since been abandoned by the Company.
 
During the years 2009 to date the Company was involved in the acquisition, production, licensing, marketing and distribution of mixed martial arts (MMA) content, programming and merchandising for North American and International markets. The Company is currently negotiating to transfer to the former President of the Company all of its rights to and interests in its mixed martial arts program (Takedown), including any and all Takedown assets, in return for the forgiveness of a liability of $29,812 owing to the former President of the Company.
 
We had $3,361 in cash reserves as of the year ended July 31, 2014. We anticipate that we will incur $50,000 for administrative expenses, including professional legal and accounting expenses associated with compliance with our periodic reporting requirements over the next twelve months, and approximately $10,000 per month ($120,000) to continue with our business development.
 
We are contemplating raising additional capital to finance our business operations. No final decisions regarding financing have been made at this time. It is anticipated that funding for the Company will come from one or more of the following means: engaging in an offering of our stock; engaging in borrowing; locating a joint venture partner or partners.
 
BANKRUPTCY OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS
 
We have not been the subject of a bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings.
 
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 
During the years 2009 to date the Company was involved in the acquisition, production, licensing, marketing and distribution of mixed martial arts (MMA) content, programming and merchandising for North American and International markets. The Company was never able to close asset acquisition agreements due to a lack of funding. As a result, we have no customers or consumers of our products, we have no principal suppliers or sources for materials. There is no need for government approval of our products and services.
 
During the current year, we reviewed two business opportunities. On November 13, 2013, the Company entered into an option to purchase a 50% interest in BION for a total of $2,500,000, a company wholly owned by Aartha USA Inc. Aartha is an approved licensee of a patented hybrid iron/vanadium chemical solution technology developed and owned by PNNL Labs. PNNL has agreed to license Aartha its solution technology for a period of thirty years for the areas of North and South America and Aartha has agreed to supply BION with the solution technology for thirty years. The Company paid $98,800 for this option and has decided not to proceed with this business opportunity at this time.
 
On January 16, 2014 the Company entered an option agreement whereby the Company holds the option to acquire twelve 2 megawatt wind turbines for a total of $2,280,000 or $190,000 per each turbine.  An option fee of $150,000 was paid and has been expensed. The Company has decided not to proceed with this business opportunity at this time.
