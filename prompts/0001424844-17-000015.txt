Item 1.   Business.
The Company is an Iowa limited liability company located in Council Bluffs, Iowa, formed in March, 2005. The Company is permitted to produce 140 million gallons of ethanol.  The Company historically was permitted to produce up to 125 million gallons under it's air permit; however, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) approved an increase in the Company's air permit to allow for production of 140 million gallons per rolling 12 months starting in March 2017.
We began producing ethanol in February, 2009 and sell our ethanol, distillers grains, and corn oil in the United States, Mexico and the Pacific Rim.  
1

Our production facility (the “Facility”) is located in Pottawattamie County in southwestern Iowa, south of Council Bluffs. It is near two major interstate highways, I29 and I80, within a mile of the Missouri River and has access to five major rail carriers. This location is in close proximity to a significant amount of corn and has convenient product market access. The Facility receives corn and chemical deliveries primarily by truck and is able to utilize rail delivery if necessary.  Finished products are shipped by rail and truck.  The site has access to water from ground wells and from the Missouri River.  Additionally, in close proximity to the Facility’s primary energy source (steam), there are two natural gas providers available, both with infrastructure immediately accessible to the Facility.
Financial Information
Please refer to “Item 7-Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for information about our revenue, profit and loss measurements and total assets and liabilities, and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for our financial statements and supplementary data.
Rail Access
We own a six mile loop railroad track for rail service to our Facility, which accommodates several unit trains.  We are party to an Industrial Track Agreement with CBEC Railway, Inc. (the “Track Agreement “), which governs our use of the loop railroad and requires, among other things, that we maintain the loop track.
We are a party to an Amended and Restated Railcar Lease Agreement (“Railcar Agreement”) with Bunge North America, Inc. (“Bunge”), a significant equity holder, for the lease of 323 ethanol cars and 298 hopper cars which are used for the delivery and marketing of our ethanol and distillers grains.  Under the Railcar Agreement, we leased railcars for terms lasting 120 months which continues on a month to month basis thereafter. The Railcar Agreement will terminate upon the expiration of all railcar leases. Pursuant to the terms of a side letter to the Railcar Agreement, we sublease cars back to Bunge or third parties from time to time when the cars are not in use in our operations. We work with Bunge to determine the most economic use of the available ethanol and hopper cars in light of current market conditions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we subleased 96 hopper cars to Bunge, and maintained our lease agreement for 92 hopper cars to two separate third parties. In June 2017, we also entered into a second 36 month lease for an additional 30 non-insulated tank cars from an unrelated third party leasing company (this was in addition to the 30 non-insulated tank cars leased from that company signed December 2015).
Employees
We had 61 full time employees, as of September 30, 2017.  We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and we have not experienced any work stoppages.  Our management considers our employee relationships to be favorable.
Principal Products
The principal products we produce are ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil, and carbon dioxide ("CO2").
Ethanol

Our primary product is ethanol. Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, a fuel component made primarily from corn and various other grains, which can be used as: (i) an octane enhancer in fuels; (ii) an oxygenated fuel additive for the purpose of reducing ozone and carbon monoxide vehicle emissions; and (iii) a non-petroleum-based gasoline substitute.  More than 99% of all ethanol produced in the United States is used in its primary form for blending with unleaded gasoline and other fuel products.  The principal purchasers of ethanol are generally wholesale gasoline marketers or blenders.  Ethanol is shipped by truck in the local markets, and by rail in the regional, national and international markets.
We produced 124.1 million and 122.3 million gallons of ethanol for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 ("Fiscal 2017") and September 30, 2016 (“Fiscal 2016”), respectively, and approximately 80.9% and 77.4% of our revenue was derived from the sale of ethanol in Fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Distillers Grain
 The principal co-product of the ethanol production process is distillers grains, a high protein, high-energy animal feed marketed primarily to the beef and dairy industries.  Distillers grains contain by-pass protein that is superior to other protein supplements such as cottonseed meal and soybean meal..  We produce two forms of distillers grains: wet distillers grains with solubles (“WDGS”) and dried distillers grains with solubles (“DDGS”).  WDGS are processed corn mash that has been dried to approximately 50% to 65% moisture.  WDGS have a shelf life of approximately seven days and are sold to local markets.  DDGS 
2

are processed corn mash that has been dried to approximately 10% to 12% moisture.  It has a longer shelf life and may be sold and shipped to any market.
In Fiscal 2017, we sold 9.2% less tons of distillers grains compared to Fiscal 2016. Approximately 14.0% and 18.1% of our revenue was derived from the sale of distillers grains in Fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Corn Oil

Our system separates corn oil from the post-fermentation syrup stream as it leaves the evaporators of the ethanol plant. The corn oil is then routed to storage tanks, and the remaining concentrated syrup is routed to the plant’s syrup tank. Corn oil can be marketed as either a feed additive or a biodiesel feedstock.  We sold 5.2% more tons of corn oil in Fiscal 2017 than in Fiscal 2016, with approximately 4.6% and 3.9% of our revenue generated from corn oil sales, respectively.
Carbon Dioxide
In April 2013, we entered into a Carbon Dioxide Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “CO2 Agreement”) with Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., formerly known as EPCO Carbon Dioxide Products, Inc. ("Air Products") under which we agreed to supply, and Air Products agreed to purchase, a portion of raw CO2 gas produced by our Facility. In addition, we entered into a Non-Exclusive CO2 Facility Site Lease Agreement under which we granted Air Products a non-exclusive right of entry and license to construct, maintain and operate a carbon dioxide liquefaction plant (the “CO2 Plant”) on a site near our Facility. The term of the CO2 Agreement runs for ten (10) years from the startup of the CO2 Plant (the “Initial Term”) and then renews automatically for two (2) additional five (5) year periods thereafter, unless written notice of termination is submitted within six (6) months prior to the end of the then current term.
Air Products pays us a base price per ton, which acts as a floor price, Air Products will pay us an additional amount based on Air Products profits above a minimum targeted margin. The CO2 Agreement also contains a take or pay obligation pursuant to which Air Products agrees to pay us for a minimum number of tons each year. CO2 was 0.4% and 0.3% of our revenue generated in Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively.
Principal Product Markets
As described below in “Distribution Methods,” we market and distribute all of our ethanol and distillers grains through Bunge.  Our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil are primarily sold in the domestic market; however, as markets allow, our products can be, and have been, sold in the export markets. We expect Bunge to explore all markets for our ethanol and distillers grains, including export markets, and believe that there is some potential for increased international sales of our products. However, due to high transportation costs, and the fact that we are not located near a major international shipping port, we expect a majority of our products to continue to be marketed and sold domestically. 
 In the first half of 2017, ethanol exports experienced by the industry increased 29% as compared to the first six months of 2016. Exports of ethanol have increased with Brazil receiving the largest percentage of ethanol produced in the United States, and Canada and India in second and third place, respectively. These three countries constitute almost 75% of all ethanol exports. India, the Philippines, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea and Peru have also been other destinations for ethanol exports in the first half of 2017. 
However, ethanol export demand is more unpredictable than domestic demand, and tends to fluctuate over time as it is subject to monetary and political forces in other nations. For instance, a strong U.S. Dollar is an example of a force that may negatively impact ethanol exports from the United States. In addition, during 2017 Brazil and China adopted import quotas and/or tariffs on the importation of ethanol which are expected to continue to negatively impact U.S. exports. China, the number three importer of U.S. ethanol in 2016, has imported negligible volumes year-to-date due to a 30% tariff imposed on U.S. and Brazil fuel ethanol, which took effect on January 1, 2017. However, on September 13, 2017, China’s National Development and Reform Commission, the National Energy Board and 15 other state departments issued a joint plan to expand the use and production of biofuels containing up to 10% ethanol by 2020. This joint plan may support increased exports to China; however, there is no guarantee that the joint plan will offset the adverse impacts of the tariff or that there will be any positive impact to domestic exports to China. 
On September 1, 2017, Brazil’s Chamber of Foreign Trade, or CAMEX, issued an official written resolution, imposing a 20% tariff on U.S. ethanol imports in excess of 150 million liters, or 39.6 million gallons per quarter. The ruling is valid for two years. The export market is beginning to see the impact of the imposition of these tariffs. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, during September 2017, Brazil fell out of the top two customers of U.S. ethanol exports for the first time in 16 months 
3

which is most likely the result of the nation's implementation of the 20% tariff on imported ethanol. Exports to Brazil in September 2017 decreased by 20% compared to August 2017 exports and by 70% compared to the peak in May 2017. The Chinese and Brazil tariffs have had, and likely will continue to have, a negative impact on the export market demand and prices for ethanol produced in the United States.
Distillers grains have become more accepted as animal feed throughout the world and therefore, distillers grains exporting has increased and may continue to increase as worldwide acceptance grows. According to the Energy Information Administration (the “EIA”), U.S. distiller’s grains exports through August 30, 2017 were approximately 4% lower than distiller’s grains exports for the same eight-month period last year with Mexico, Turkey, South Korea, Canada, Thailand and Indonesia accounting for 62% of total U.S. distillers export volumes
Historically, the United States ethanol industry exported a significant amount of distillers grains to China; however, exports to China have significantly decreased as a result of the Chinese antidumping and countervailing investigations and the implementation of significant duties on importing into China distillers grains produced in the United States. In January 2017, China announced a final ruling which set the antidumping duties at a range between 42.2% and 53.7% and anti-subsidy duties at a range between 11.2% to 12%. The imposition of these duties resulted in plummeting demand from this top importer requiring United States producers to seek out alternatives markets, most notably in Mexico and Canada. On September 1, 2017, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development of Vietnam lifted the suspension which blocked imports of U.S. dried distiller’s grains which had been in place since December 2016. Prior to the implementation of the suspension, Vietnam had historically been a substantial export market for U.S. distiller’s grains representing the third largest export market for U.S. distillers grains. The lift of this suspension may result in increased exports to Vietnam; however, there is no guarantee that the Vietnamese export market will achieve significant growth

We sell carbon dioxide directly to Air Products and we market and distribute all of the corn oil we produce directly to end users in the domestic market.
Distribution Methods
On December 5, 2014, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Ethanol Purchase Agreement (the “Ethanol Agreement”) with Bunge. Under the Ethanol Agreement, the Company has agreed to sell Bunge all of the ethanol produced by the Company, and Bunge has agreed to purchase the same.  The Company pays Bunge a percentage fee for ethanol sold by Bunge, subject to a minimum and maximum annual fee.  The initial term of the Ethanol Agreement expires on December 31, 2019, however it will automatically renew for one five-year term unless Bunge provides the Company with notice of election to terminate.
We entered into a Distillers Grain Purchase Agreement, as amended (“DG Agreement”) with Bunge, under which Bunge is obligated to purchase from us and we are obligated to sell to Bunge all distillers grains produced at our Facility.
The initial term of the DG Agreement runs until December 31, 2019, and will automatically renew for one additional five year terms unless Bunge provides the Company with notice of election to terminate.  Under the DG Agreement, Bunge pays us a purchase price equal to the sales price minus the marketing fee and transportation costs.  The sales price is the price received by Bunge in a contract consistent with the DG Marketing Policy or the spot price agreed to between Bunge and the Company. Bunge receives a marketing fee consisting of a percentage of the net sales price, subject to a minimum and maximum amount. Net sales price is the sales price less the transportation costs and rail lease charges.  The transportation costs are all freight charges, fuel surcharges, and other access charges applicable to delivery of distillers grains.  Rail lease charges are the monthly lease payment for rail cars along with all administrative and tax filing fees for such leased rail cars.
 We market and distribute all of the corn oil we produce directly to end users within the domestic market.
Raw Materials
Corn Requirements

The principal raw material necessary to produce ethanol, distillers grain and corn oil is corn. We are significantly dependent on the availability and price of corn which are affected by supply and demand factors such as crop production, carryout, exports, government policies and programs, risk management and weather.  With the volatility of the weather and commodity markets, we cannot predict the future price of corn. Because the market price of ethanol is not directly related to corn prices, we, like most ethanol producers, are not able to compensate for increases in the cost of corn through adjustments in our prices for our ethanol although we do see increases in the prices of our distillers grain during times of higher corn prices. However, given that ethanol 
4

sales comprise a majority of our revenues, our inability to adjust our ethanol prices can result in a negative impact on our profitability during periods of high corn prices.
In November 2017, the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”) revised their estimates for the 2017/2018 corn crop to increase its forecast to 14.6 billion bushels with yields averaging 175.4 bushels per acre. These projections are substantially lower than the 2016/2017 results for corn yield and production in the United States. The USDA also forecasted the area harvested for corn at 83.1 million acres which is 4% lower than the 86.6 million acres harvested in the USDA report for 2016/2017. Although the revised forecast for production and yield are lower than the prior crop year, if the USDA forecasts are realized, the 2017/2018 corn crop will be the second highest production and yield on record in the United States. 
Our management expects that corn prices will continue to remain lower through the first two quarters of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 (“Fiscal 2018”) as a result of the high levels of production and yield forecasted by the USDA, as well as carryover levels from the prior year. However, if corn prices rise again, it will have an adverse impact on our operating margins unless the prices we receive for our ethanol and distillers grains are able to outpace the rising corn prices. Management continually monitors corn prices and the availability of corn near the Facility and also continually attempts to minimize the effects of the volatility of corn costs on profitability through its risk management strategies, including hedging positions taken in the corn market. 
 Our Facility needs approximately 48.3 million bushels of corn annually, to produce 140 million gallons of ethanol, or approximately 132,300 bushels per day.  During Fiscal 2017 we purchased 0.4% less corn compared to Fiscal 2016, which was obtained entirely from local markets.  The Company and Bunge also entered into an Amended and Restated Grain Feedstock Agency Agreement on December 5, 2014 (the “Agency Agreement”).  The Agency Agreement provides that Bunge will procure corn for the Company and the Company will pay Bunge a per bushel fee, subject to a minimum and maximum annual fee.  The initial term of the Agency Agreement expires on December 31, 2019 and will automatically renew for one additional five year term unless Bunge provides notice of election to the Company to terminate. 
Starting with the 2015 crop year, the Company began exploring using corn containing Syngenta Seeds, Inc.’s proprietary Enogen® technology (“Enogen Corn”) for a portion of its ethanol production needs. The Company contracts directly with growers to produce Enogen Corn for sale to the Company. Consistent with our Agency Agreement with Bunge, we also entered into a Services Agreement with Bunge regarding corn purchases (the “ Services Agreement ”). Under this Services Agreement, we originate all Enogen Corn contracts for our Facility and Bunge will assist us with certain administrative matters related to Enogen Corn, including facilitating delivery to our Facility. Fiscal year 2017 was our second full year of accepting Enogen, and deliveries constituted 14.9% of all corn deliveries, an increase from Fiscal 2016's initial level of 8.7%. 
Energy Requirements

The production of ethanol is an energy intensive process which uses significant amounts of electricity and steam or natural gas as a heat source.  Presently, about 24,000 MMBTUs of energy are required to produce a gallon of ethanol.  It is our goal to operate the plant as safely and profitably as possible, optimizing the amount of energy consumed per gallon of ethanol produced, balanced with the relative values of WDGS as compared to DDGS.  
Steam

Unlike most ethanol producers in the United States which use natural gas as their primary energy source, we have access to steam as a one of our energy sources in addition to natural gas. Historically, we have changed between steam and natural gas depending on energy costs and other factors.  We believe our ability to utilize steam makes us more competitive, as under certain energy market conditions our energy costs will be lower than natural gas fired plants.  We have entered into a Steam Service Contract (“Steam Contract”) with MidAmerican Energy Company (“MidAm”), under which MidAm provides us the steam required by us, up to 475,000 pounds per hour.  Effective in January 2013, we amended the Steam Contract to link our net energy rates and charges for steam to certain specified energy indexes, subject to certain minimum and maximum rates, so that our steam costs remain competitive with the general energy market. Effective in August 2015, we amended the Steam Contract to extend the term until November 2024. During Fiscal 2017, we purchased approximately 23.2% more steam compared to Fiscal 2016. This increase in Fiscal 2017 was due to a much slower increase in the price of steam relative to natural gas for the Company. The increase in Fiscal 2017 was partially offset by the fact that the amount of available steam from MidAm was reduced as a result of MidAm’s increased utilization of wind energy rather than coal in Fiscal 2017, which generally reduces the amount of available steam produced.
Natural Gas

5

Although steam has traditionally been considered our primary energy source, natural gas accounted for approximately 55.0% of our energy usage in Fiscal 2017, down from 65% in Fiscal 2016. This was influenced by the 30% increase in the natural gas cost per MMBTU during Fiscal 2017 combined with greater steam availability. We have two natural gas boilers for use when our steam service is temporarily unavailable. Natural gas is also needed for incidental purposes.  We entered into a natural gas supply agreement with Encore Energy in April of 2012 to fulfill our natural gas needs at the Gas Daily Midpoint pricing.  
Electricity

Our Facility requires a large continuous supply of electrical energy.  In Fiscal 2017 we used approximately 3.5% more electricity compared to Fiscal 2016. This was primarily due to higher production levels during the hot 2017 summer months as compared to 2016.
Water

We require a supply of water typical for the industry for our corn to ethanol process.  Our primary water source comes from the underground Missouri River aquifer via our three onsite wells. The majority of the water used in an ethanol plant is recycled back into the plant.  All our ground water is treated through our onsite water oxidation system. This filtered water is used throughout our process. We do treat (polish) some of this filtered water for boiler and cooling tower make-up with our Reverse Osmosis (RO) system to minimize any elements that will harm the boiler and steam systems.  We send some of our non-process (corn) contact water back to the Missouri River, including our Cooling Tower and Green Sand filtered backwash waters.  The makeup water requirements for the cooling tower are primarily a result of evaporation and cooling.  We also evaporate much of our water through our dryer system for dried corn distillers grains.  The rest of our process water is recycled back into the plant, which minimizes any waste of our water supply.  
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions
SIRE® and our SIRE® logo are registered trademarks of the Company in the United States. Other trademarks, service marks and trade names used in this report constitute common law trademarks and/or service marks of the Company. Other parties’ marks referred to in this report are the property of their respective owners. We were granted a perpetual license by ICM, Inc. (“ICM”) to use certain ethanol production technology necessary to operate our Facility.  There is no ongoing fee or definitive calendar term for this license.
Seasonality of Sales
We experience some seasonality of demand for our ethanol. Since ethanol is predominantly blended with conventional gasoline for use in automobiles, ethanol demand tends to shift in relation to gasoline demand. As a result, we experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol in the summer months related to increased driving. In addition, we experience some increased ethanol demand during holiday seasons related to increased gasoline demand. 
Risk Management and Hedging Transactions
The profitability of our operations is highly dependent on the impact of market fluctuations associated with commodity prices.  We use various derivative instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk and to reduce the risk that our ethanol production will become unprofitable when market prices among our principal commodities and products do not correlate.  In order to mitigate our commodity and product price risks, we enter into hedging transactions, including forward corn, ethanol, distillers grain and natural gas contracts, in an attempt to partially offset the effects of price volatility for corn and ethanol.  We also enter into over-the-counter and exchange-traded futures and option contracts for corn, ethanol and distillers grains, designed to limit our exposure to increases in the price of corn and manage ethanol price fluctuations.  Although we believe that our hedging strategies can reduce the risk of price fluctuations, the financial statement impact of these activities depends upon, among other things, the prices involved and our ability to physically receive or deliver the commodities involved.  Our hedging activities could cause net income to be volatile from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the change in value of the derivative instruments relative to the cost and use of the commodity being hedged.  As corn and ethanol prices move in reaction to market trends and information, our income statement will be affected depending on the impact such market movements have on the value of our derivative instruments.
Hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in situations where the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults or, in the case of exchange-traded contracts, where there is a change in the expected differential between the price of the commodity underlying the hedging agreement and the actual prices paid or received by us for the physical commodity bought or sold.  There are also situations where the hedging transactions themselves may result in losses, as when a position is purchased 
6

in a declining market or a position is sold in a rising market. Hedging losses may be offset by a decreased cash price for corn and natural gas and an increased cash price for ethanol and distillers grains.
We continually monitor and manage our commodity risk exposure and our hedging transactions as part of our overall risk management policy.  As a result, we may vary the amount of hedging or other risk mitigation strategies we undertake, and we may choose not to engage in hedging transactions.  Our ability to hedge is always subject to our liquidity and available capital.
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
As discussed above, we have marketing and agency agreements with Bunge, for the purpose of marketing and distributing our principal products.  We rely on Bunge for the sale and distribution of the majority of our products.  Currently, we do not have the ability to market our ethanol and distillers grains internally should Bunge be unable or refuse to market these products at acceptable prices.  However, we anticipate that we would be able to very quickly secure competitive marketers should we need to replace Bunge for any reason.
Competition 
Domestic Ethanol Competitors
The ethanol we produce is similar to ethanol produced by other domestic plants.  According to the Renewable Fuels Association, as of October 27, 2017 there were 214 ethanol production facilities in the United States capable of producing 16.1 billion gallons based on nameplate capacity and seven additional plants under expansion or construction with capacity to produce an additional 463 million gallons. Further, the Renewable Fuels Association estimates that virtually none of the ethanol production capacity in the United States is idled. The top five producers account for approximately 45% of domestic production.  We are in direct competition with many of these top five producers as well as other national producers, many of whom have greater resources and experience than we have and each of which is producing significantly more ethanol than we produce. In addition, we believe that the ethanol industry will continue to consolidate leading to a market where a small number of large ethanol producers with substantial production capacities will control an even larger portion of the U.S. ethanol production. In recent years, the ethanol industry has also seen increased competition from oil companies who have purchased ethanol production facilities. These oil companies are required to blend a certain amount of ethanol each year.
We may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our larger competitors and the oil companies who are capable of producing a significantly greater amount of ethanol, have multiple ethanol plants that may help them achieve certain efficiencies and other benefits that we cannot achieve with one ethanol plant or are able to operate at times when it is unprofitable for us to operate. For instance, ethanol producers that own multiple plants may be able to compete in the marketplace more effectively, especially during periods when operating margins are unfavorable, because they have the flexibility to run certain production facilities while reducing production or shutting down production at other facilities. These large producers may also be able to realize economies of scale which we are unable to realize or they may have better negotiating positions with purchasers.  Further, new products or methods of ethanol production developed by larger and better-financed competitors could provide them competitive advantages over us.
Foreign Ethanol Competitors

In recent years, the ethanol industry has experienced increased competition from international suppliers of ethanol and although ethanol imports have decreased during the past few years, if competition from ethanol imports were to increase again, such increased imports could negatively impact demand for domestic ethanol which could adversely impact our financial results. Large international companies with much greater resources than ours have developed, or are developing, increased foreign ethanol production capacities. 
Many international suppliers produce ethanol primarily from inputs other than corn, such as sugarcane, and have cost structures that may be substantially lower than U.S. based ethanol producers including us. Many of these international suppliers are companies with much greater resources than us with greater production capacities.
Brazil is the world’s second largest ethanol producer. Brazil makes ethanol primarily from sugarcane as opposed to corn, and depending on feedstock prices, may be less expensive to produce. Several large companies produce ethanol in Brazil, including affiliates of Bunge. In 2017, 15.0 billion gallons of corn based biofuels blending was mandated by the Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS2, when U.S. ethanol production was 15.8 billion gallons. Many in the ethanol industry are concerned that certain provisions of RFS2 as adopted may disproportionately benefit ethanol produced from sugarcane. This could make sugarcane based ethanol, which is primarily produced in Brazil, more competitive in the United States ethanol market. If this were to occur, it could reduce demand for the ethanol that we produce. In recent years, sugarcane ethanol imported from Brazil has been one of the most 
7

economical means for certain obligated parties to comply with the RFS2 requirement to blend 4.3 billion gallons of advanced biofuels.
Effective March 16, 2015, the Brazilian government increased the required percentage of ethanol in vehicle fuel sold in Brazil to 27% from 25% which, along with more competitively priced ethanol produced from corn, significantly reduced U.S. ethanol imports from Brazil as compared to imports during 2015 and 2016. However, there has been an increase in U.S. ethanol imports from Brazil during calendar year 2017 as compared to calendar 2016. Brazil favored sugar production over ethanol production, as they were encouraged by the higher prices for the sweetener in the international market. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) data shows ethanol imports from Brazil rose to 1,766 thousand barrels in the first eight months of calendar 2017 from 819 thousand barrels in the first eight months of calendar 2016. Based on the current strength of the United States Dollar compared to the Brazilian Reis along with very favorable prices for sugarcane based ethanol in the United States, specifically in California, it is possible that ethanol imports from Brazil may continue to increase in Fiscal 2018 which will further impact the level of ethanol supplies in the United States and may result in ethanol price decreases.
Depending on feedstock prices, ethanol imported from foreign countries, including Brazil, may be less expensive than domestically-produced ethanol.  However, foreign demand, transportation costs and infrastructure constraints may temper the market impact on the United States.
Local Ethanol Production

Because we are located on the border of Iowa and Nebraska, and because ethanol producers generally compete primarily with local and regional producers, the ethanol producers located in Iowa and Nebraska presently constitute our primary competition.  According to the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, as of September, 2017, Iowa had 43 ethanol refineries in production, with a combined nameplate capacity to produce 4.05 billion gallons of ethanol.  The Nebraska Energy Office reports that as of September 2017, there are currently 22 existing ethanol plants in production inNebraska with a combined ethanol nameplate production capacity of approximately 1.94 billion gallons.
Competition from Alternative Renewable Fuels
We anticipate increased competition from renewable fuels that do not use corn as feedstock. Many of the current ethanol production incentives are designed to encourage the production of renewable fuels using raw materials other than corn, including cellulose. Cellulose is the main component of plant cell walls and is the most common organic compound on earth. Cellulose is found in wood chips, corn stalks, rice straw, amongst other common plants. Cellulosic ethanol is ethanol produced from cellulose. Research continues regarding cellulosic ethanol, and various companies are in various stages of developing and constructing some of the first generation cellulosic plants. Several companies have commenced pilot projects to study the feasibility of commercially producing cellulosic ethanol and are producing cellulosic ethanol on a small scale and at a few companies in the United States have begun producing on a commercial scale. Additional commercial scale cellulosic ethanol plants could be completed in the near future, although these cellulosic ethanol plants have faced some financial and technological issues, If this technology can be profitably employed on a commercial scale, it could potentially lead to ethanol that is less expensive to produce than corn based ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol may also capture more government subsidies and assistance than corn based ethanol. This could decrease demand for our product or result in competitive disadvantages for our ethanol production process.
Because our Facility is designed as single-feedstock facilities, we have limited ability to adapt the plant to a different feedstock or process system without additional capital investment and retooling.
A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems using fuel cells, plug-in hybrids, electric cars or clean burning gaseous fuels. Like ethanol, the emerging fuel cell industry offers a technological option to address worldwide energy costs, the long-term availability of petroleum reserves and environmental concerns. Fuel cells have emerged as a potential alternative to certain existing power sources because of their higher efficiency, reduced noise and lower emissions. Fuel cell industry participants are currently targeting the transportation, stationary power and portable power markets in order to decrease fuel costs, lessen dependence on crude oil and reduce harmful emissions. If the fuel cell industry continues to expand and gain broad acceptance and becomes readily available to consumers for motor vehicle use, we may not be able to compete effectively. This additional competition could reduce the demand for ethanol, which would negatively impact our profitability.
Distillers Grain Competition
Ethanol plants in the Midwest produce the majority of distillers grains and primarily compete with other ethanol producers in the production and sales of distillers grains. According to the Renewable Fuels Association's Ethanol Industry Outlook 2017 
8

(the “RFA 2017 Outlook”), ethanol plants produced more than 42 million metric tons of distillers grains and other animal feed .  We compete with other producers of distillers grains products both locally and nationally.
The primary customers of distillers grains are dairy and beef cattle, according to the RFA 2017 Outlook. In recent years, an increasing amount of distillers grains have been used in the swine, poultry and fish markets. Numerous feeding trials show advantages in milk production, growth, rumen health, and palatability over other dairy cattle feeds. With the advancement of research into the feeding rations of poultry and swine, we expect these markets to expand and create additional demand for distillers grains; however, no assurance can be given that these markets will in fact expand, or if they do, that we will benefit from such expansion.
The market for distillers grains is generally confined to locations where freight costs allow it to be competitively priced against other feed ingredients. Distillers grains compete with three other feed formulations: corn gluten feed, dry brewers grain and mill feeds. The primary value of these products as animal feed is their protein content. Dry brewers grain and distillers grains have about the same protein content, and corn gluten feed and mill feeds have slightly lower protein contents. Distillers grains contain nutrients, fat content, and fiber that we believe will differentiate our distillers grains products from other feed formulations. However, producers of other forms of animal feed may also have greater experience and resources than we do and their products may have greater acceptance among producers of beef and dairy cattle, poultry and hogs.
Principal Supply & Demand Factors
Ethanol

Ethanol prices stayed low during Fiscal 2017, partially in response to lower corn and oil prices and the large supply of corn and oil.  The increased production of ethanol within the United States also impacted ethanol prices during Fiscal 2017. The increase in ethanol production resulted from the domestic producers responding to the consistently low corn prices during Fiscal 2017. 
Management currently expects ethanol prices will continue to adjust to the supply and demand factors of ethanol and oil and will generally fluctuate with, but not be directly correlated to, the price of corn.  
Management believes the industry will need to grow both retail product delivery infrastructure and demand for ethanol in order to increase production margins in the near and long term.
Management also believes it is important that ethanol blending capabilities of the gasoline market be expanded to increase demand for ethanol.  Recently, there has been increased awareness of the need to expand retail ethanol distribution and blending infrastructure, which would allow the ethanol industry to supply ethanol to markets in the United States that are not currently selling significant amounts of ethanol.
The overall demand for transportation fuel also impacts the demand for ethanol. The demand for transportation fuel peaked in 2007, dropped dramatically during the recession, stabilized, and in 2016 has returned to 2007 levels. According to EIA data, there is a demand for approximately 143 billion gallons of total gasoline demand in the United States in 2016. The fuel efficiency of vehicles and the total number of miles traveled by consumers affects the overall demand for transportation fuel and thus also impacts the demand for ethanol. According to the EIA, in 2016, the increase in gasoline consumption reflects a forecasted 2.5% increase in highway travel (because of employment growth and lower retail prices), that is partially offset by increases in vehicle fleet fuel economy. Market acceptance of E15 and E85, as approved by the Environmental Protection Agency for use in passenger cars from the 2001 model year or later will continue the growth in ethanol sales in the near future. 
Distillers Grains
Distillers grains compete with other protein-based animal feed products. In North America, over 80% of distillers grains are used in ruminant animal diets, and are also fed to poultry and swine.  Every bushel of corn used in the dry grind ethanol process yields approximately 17 pounds of dry matter distillers grains, which is an excellent source of energy and protein for livestock and poultry.  The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease. The prices of competing animal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which these products are derived. Downward pressure on commodity prices, such as soybeans and corn, will generally cause the price of competing animal feed products to decline, resulting in downward pressure on the price of distillers grains.
Historically, sales prices for distillers grains have correlated with prices of corn. However, there have been occasions when the price increase for this co-product has not been directly correlated to changes in corn prices. In addition, our distillers grains compete with products made from other feedstocks, the cost of which may not rise when corn prices rise. Consequently, 
9

the price we may receive for distillers grains may not rise as corn prices rise, thereby lowering our cost recovery percentage relative to corn.
Management expects that distillers grain prices will continue to generally follow the price of corn during Fiscal 2018.
Competition for Supply of Corn
During crop year 2017, according to the USDA November report, 83.1 million acres of corn were planted, which was down 4.0% from 2016. Although there were less acres planted, the expected yield is 175.4 bushels per acre, which is slightly above 2016's record results. Prices for corn are expected to stay low as a result of the high levels of production and yields forecasted by the USDA.
Competition for corn supply from other ethanol plants and other corn consumers exists around our Facility.  According to Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, as of September, 2017, there were 43 operational ethanol plants in Iowa. The plants are concentrated, for the most part, in the northern and central regions of the state where a majority of the corn is produced. The existence and development of other ethanol plants, if any, particularly those in close proximity to our Facility, may increase the demand for corn which may result in even higher costs for supplies of corn.
We compete with other users of corn, including ethanol producers regionally and nationally, producers of food and food ingredients for human consumption (such as high fructose corn syrup, starches, and sweeteners), producers of animal feed and industrial users. According to the USDA, for 2016/2017, 5.5 billion bushels of U.S. corn were used in ethanol production, with 6.9 billion bushels being used in food and other industrial uses, and 1.9 billion bushels used for export.  As of September 2017, the USDA has forecast the amount of corn to be used for ethanol production during the current marketing year at 5.4 billion bushels approximately the same as the prior year.
Federal Ethanol Support and Governmental Regulations

RFS and Related Federal Legislation

The ethanol industry is dependent on several economic incentives to produce ethanol, including ethanol use mandates. One significant federal ethanol support is the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard (the “RFS”) which has been and will continue to be a driving factor in the growth of ethanol usage. The RFS requires that in each year a certain amount of renewable fuels must be used in the United States. The RFS is a national program that does not require that any renewable fuels be used in any particular area or state, allowing refiners to use renewable fuel blends in those areas where it is most cost-effective.   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) is responsible for revising and implementing regulations to ensure that transportation fuel sold in the United States contains a minimum volume of renewable fuel.  
The RFS2 requirements increase incrementally each year through 2022 when the mandate requires that the United States use 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels.  Starting in 2009, the RFS required that a portion of the RFS must be met by certain “advanced” renewable fuels. These advanced renewable fuels include ethanol that is not made from corn, such as cellulosic ethanol and biomass based biodiesel. The use of these advanced renewable fuels increases each year as a percentage of the total renewable fuels required to be used in the United States.
Annually, the EPA is supposed to pass a rule that establishes the number of gallons of different types of renewable fuels that must be used in the United States which is called the renewable volume obligations.On November 30, 2015, the EPA issued its final rules for the annual 2014, 2015 and 2016 renewable volume obligations (the “Final 2014 - 2016 Rules”). On May 18, 2016, the EPA released a proposed rule to set 2017 renewable volume requirements under RFS2 which set the annual volume requirement for renewable fuel at 18.8 billion gallons per year, of which 14.8 billion gallons may be met with corn-based ethanol. The EPA issued the final rule for 2017 and increased the total volume requirements from 18.8 billion gallons to 19.24 billion gallons (the “Final 2017 Rule”). Although the volume requirements set forth in the Final 2017 Rule are a significant increase over the 2016 volume requirements and the 2017 requirements originally proposed in May 2016, the 2017 volume requirements are still below the 2017 statutory mandate of 24 billion gallons per year. However, in connection with the issuance of the Final 2017 Rule, the EPA increased the number of gallons which may be met by corn-based ethanol from 14.8 billion gallons to 15 billion gallons. This brings the renewable volume obligations for conventional renewable fuels that can be met by corn-based ethanol back to the levels called for in the statutory mandate for 2017/
On July 5, 2017, the EPA released a proposed rule to set the 2018 renewable volume requirements which would set the annual volume requirement for renewable fuel at 19.24 billion gallons of renewable fuels per year (the “Proposed 2018 Rule”). On November 30, 2017, the EPA issued the final rule for 2018 which varied only slightly from the Proposed 2018 Rule with the 
10

annual volume requirement for renewable fuel set at 19.29 billion gallons of renewable fuels per year (the "Final 2018 Rule"). Although the volume requirements set forth in the Final 2018 Rule are slightly higher than the 19.28 billion gallons required under the Final 2017 Rule, the volume requirements are still significantly below the 26 billion gallons statutory mandate for 2018 with significant reductions in the volume requirements for advanced biofuels. However, the Final 2018 Rule does maintain the number of gallons which may be met by conventional renewable fuels such as corn-based ethanol at 15.0 billion gallons.
The following chart sets forth (in billion gallons) the statutory volumes, the Final 2014-2016 Rule volumes, the Final 2017 Rule volumes and the Final 2018 Rule volumes.

 | | Total Renewable Fuel Volume Requirement | Portion of Volume Requirement That Can Be Met By Corn-based Ethanol
2014 | Statutory | 18.15 | 14.10 
Final 2014-2016 Rules | 16.28 | 13.61 
2015 | Statutory | 20.50 | 15.00 
Final 2014-2016 Rules | 16.93 | 14.05 
2016 | Statutory | 22.25 | 15.00 
Final 2014-2016 Rules | 18.11 | 14.50 
 | Statutory | 24.00 | 15.00 
2017 | Final 2017 Rule | 19.28 | 15.00 
2018 | Statutory | 26.00 | 15.00 
Final 2018 Rule | 19.29 | 15.00 

Under RFS, if mandatory renewable fuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumes through 2022. Since 2018 is the first year the total volume requirements are more than 20% below statutory levels, the EPA Administrator directed his staff to initiate the required technical analysis to perform any future reset consistent with the reset rules. If 2019 volume requirements are also more than 20% below statutory levels, the reset will be triggered under RFS and the EPA will be required to modify statutory volumes through 2022 within one year of the trigger event, based on the same factors used to set the volume requirements post-2022.
The volume requirements mandated in the Final 2014-2016 Rules, the 2017 Final Rule and the Final 2018 Rule are still below the volume requirements statutorily mandated by Congress. These reduced volume requirements, combined with the potential elimination of such requirements by the exercise of the EPA waiver authority or by Congress, could decrease the market price and demand for ethanol which will negatively impact our financial performance.
 However, in connection with the issuance of the Final 2017 Rule and the Final 2018 Rule, the EPA maintained the renewable volume obligations for conventional renewable fuels that can be met by corn-based ethanol back to the levels called for in the statutory mandate. Although this signals a sign of support of the RFS by the EPA and a rejection of arguments by the oil industry relating to the “blend wall,” there is no guarantee that for future years the EPA will adhere to the statutory mandate for conventional renewable fuels. 

Beginning in January 2016, various ethanol and agricultural industry groups petitioned a federal appeals court to hear a legal challenge to the EPA Final Rule. In addition, various representatives of the oil industry have also filed challenges to the EPA Final Rule. If the EPA's decision to reduce the volume requirements under the RFS is allowed to stand, or if the volume requirements are further reduced, it could have an adverse effect on the market price and demand for ethanol which would negatively impact our financial performance.
The U.S. Federal District Court for the D.C. Circuit ruled on July 28, 2017, in favor of the Americans for Clean Energy and its petitioners against the EPA related to its decision to lower the volume requirements as set forth in the Final 2016 Rule. The Court concluded the EPA erred in how it interpreted the “inadequate domestic supply” waiver provision of RFS, which authorizes 
11

the EPA to consider supply-side factors affecting the volume of renewable fuel available to refiners, blenders, and importers to meet the statutory volume requirements. The waiver provision does not allow the EPA to consider the volume of renewable fuel available to consumers or the demand-side constraints that affect the consumption of renewable fuel by consumers. As a result, the Court vacated the EPA’s decision to reduce the total renewable fuel volume requirements for 2016 through its waiver authority, which the EPA is expected to address according to Administrator Pruitt's letter. The Company currently believes this decision will benefit the industry overall with the EPA's waiver analysis now limited to supply considerations only.
Management anticipates that there will be further legal challenges to the EPA's reduction in the volume requirements, including the Final 2017 Rule. However, if the EPA's decision to reduce the volume requirements under the RFS is allowed to stand, or if the volume requirements are further reduced, it could have an adverse effect on the market price and demand for ethanol which would negatively impact our financial performance.
On October 19, 2017, EPA Administrator Pruitt issued a letter to several U.S. Senators representing states in the Midwest reiterating his commitment to the text and spirit of the RFS. He stated that the EPA will meet the November 30, 2017 deadline for issuing final 2018 volume requirements, that the EPA’s preliminary analysis suggests that final volume requirements should be set at amounts at or greater than those provided in the Proposed 2018 Rule which is consistent with the requirements set forth in the Final 2018. Rule, The letter also stated that the EPA would soon finalize a decision to deny the request to change the point of obligation for renewable identification numbers, or RINs, from refiners and importers to blenders, that the EPA is actively exploring its authority to remove arbitrary barriers to the year-rounds use of E15 and other mid-level ethanol blends so that E15 may be sold throughout the year without disruption and that the EPA will be not pursue regulations to allow ethanol exports to generate RINs. All of these statements represent actions that would likely have a positive impact on the ethanol industry either directly or indirectly.
Although the release of the Final 2018 Rule and the maintenance of the 15 billion gallon threshold for volume requirements that may be met with corn-based ethanol together with the letter issued by Administrator Pruitt signals support from the EPA and the Trump administration for domestic ethanol production, the Trump administration could still elect to materially modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate the RFS2 and it is unclear what regulatory framework and renewable volume requirements, if any, will emerge as a result of such reforms; however, any such reform could adversely affect the demand and price for ethanol and the Company's profitability.
On February 3, 2010, the EPA implemented new regulations governing the RFS which are referred to as "RFS2". The most controversial part of RFS2 involves what is commonly referred to as the lifecycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, the EPA adopted rules to determine which renewable fuels provided sufficient reductions in greenhouse gases, compared to conventional gasoline, to qualify under the RFS program. RFS2 establishes a tiered approach, where regular renewable fuels are required to accomplish a 20% greenhouse gas reduction compared to gasoline, advanced biofuels and biomass-based biodiesel must accomplish a 50% reduction in greenhouse gases, and cellulosic biofuels must accomplish a 60% reduction in greenhouse gases. Any fuels that fail to meet this standard cannot be used by fuel blenders to satisfy their obligations under the RFS program. Our ethanol plant was grandfathered into the RFS due to the fact that it was constructed prior to the effective date of the lifecycle greenhouse gas requirement and is not required to prove compliance with the lifecycle greenhouse gas reductions.
Based on the final regulations, we believe our Facility, at its current operating capacity, was grandfathered into the RFS given it was constructed prior to the effective date of the lifecycle greenhouse gas requirement and therefore is not required to prove compliance with the lifecycle greenhouse gas reductions.   However, expansion of our Facility will require us to meet a threshold of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas, or GHG emissions to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS2 mandate. In order to expand capacity at our Facility, we may be required to obtain additional permits, install advanced technology, or reduce drying of certain amounts of distillers grains. 
Many in the ethanol industry are concerned that certain provisions of RFS2 as adopted may disproportionately benefit ethanol produced from sugarcane. This could make sugarcane based ethanol, which is primarily produced in Brazil, more competitive in the United States ethanol market. If this were to occur, it could reduce demand for the ethanol that we produce.
Due primarily in response to the drought conditions experienced in 2012, claims that blending of ethanol into the motor fuel supply will be constrained by unwillingness of the market to accept greater than 10% ethanol blends, or the blend wall, and other industry factors, new legislation aimed at reducing or eliminating renewable fuel use required by RFS2 has been introduced. The Renewable Fuel Standard Elimination Act, originally introduced in April 2013 and reintroduced as H.R. 703 in February 2015, targeted the repeal of the renewable fuel program of the EPA. Also introduced in April 2013, and reintroduced as H.R. 704 in February 2015, was the RFS Reform Bill which tried to prohibit more than ten percent (10%) ethanol in gasoline and reduce the RFS2 mandated volume of renewable fuel. Both of these bills failed to make it out of congressional committee and were not enacted into law. 
12

Recently, similar legislation aimed at reducing or eliminating the renewable fuel use required by the RFS has been introduced in the United States Congress. On January 3, 2017, the Leave Ethanol Volumes at Existing Levels (LEVEL) Act (H.R. 119) was introduced in the House of Representatives. The bill would freeze renewable fuel blending requirements under the RFS at 7.5 billion gallons per year, prohibit the sale of gasoline containing more than 10% ethanol, and revoke the EPA’s approval of E15 blends. On January 31, 2017, a bill (H.R. 777) was introduced in the House of Representatives that would require the EPA and National Academies of Sciences to conduct a study on “the implications of the use of mid-level ethanol blends”. A mid-level ethanol blend is an ethanol-gasoline blend containing 10-20% ethanol by volume, including E15 and E20, that is intended to be used in any conventional gasoline-powered motor vehicle or non-road vehicle or engine. Also on January 31, 2017, a bill (H.R. 776) was introduced in the House of Representatives that would limit the volume of cellulosic biofuel required under the RFS to what is commercially available. On March 2, 2017, a bill (H.R. 1315) was introduced in the House of Representatives that would cap the volume of ethanol in gasoline at 10%. On the same day, a new version of the RFS Elimination Act (H.R. 1314), which was originally introduced in April 2013, was introduced and seeks to fully repeal the RFS.
All of these bills were assigned to a congressional subcommittee, which will consider them before possibly sending any of them on to the House of Representatives as a whole. The enactment of any of these bills or similar legislation aimed at eliminating or reducing the RFS mandates could have a material adverse impact on the ethanol industry as a whole and our business operations.
On April 17, 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation, or DOT, announced rail safety changes for transportation of ethanol and other liquids. Effective immediately, transportation of Class 3 flammable liquids, such as ethanol, are subject to new safety advisories, notices and an emergency order issued by the DOT, Federal Railroad Administration and Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. The emergency order limits trains to a maximum authorized operating speed limit when passing through highly populated areas and carrying large amounts of ethanol or other Class 3 flammable liquids.
On May 1, 2015, the DOT, in coordination with Transport Canada, announced the final rule, “Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operational Controls for High-Hazard Flammable Trains.” The rule calls for an enhanced tank car standard known as the DOT specification 117 tank car and establishes a schedule that began in May 2017 to retrofit or replace older tank cars carrying crude oil and ethanol. U.S. and Canadian shippers have until May 1, 2023, to phase out or upgrade older DOT111 tank cars servicing ethanol. Shippers have until July 1, 2023, to retrofit or replace non-jacketed CPC-1232 tank cars, and until May 1, 2025, to retrofit or replace jacketed CPC-1232 tank cars, transporting ethanol in the U.S. and Canada. The rule also establishes new braking standards intended to reduce the severity of accidents and “pile-up effect.” New operational protocols are also applicable, which include reduced speed, routing requirements and local government notifications. In addition, companies that transport hazardous materials must develop more accurate classification protocols.

State Initiatives and Mandates

In 2006, Iowa passed legislation promoting the use of renewable fuels in Iowa.  One of the most significant provisions of the Iowa renewable fuels legislation is a renewable fuels standard encouraging 10% of the gasoline sold in Iowa to consist of renewable fuels.  This renewable fuels standard increases incrementally to 25% of the gasoline sold in Iowa by 2020. To reach that goal, the use of E85 will have to climb dramatically. Gas stations that embrace E85 will be in line for state tax credits and also incentives. To qualify under the bill, ethanol must be agriculturally-derived. 
E85

Demand for ethanol has been affected by moderately increased consumption of E85 fuel, a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline.  In addition to use as a fuel in flexible fuel vehicles, E85 can be used as an aviation fuel, as reported by the National Corn Growers Association, and as a hydrogen source for fuel cells. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, there are currently more than 21 million flexible fuel vehicles capable of operating on E85 in the United States and nearly all of the major automakers have available flexible fuel modes and have indicated plans to produce several million more flexible fuel vehicles per year.  The Renewable Fuels Association reports that there are more than 3,700 retail gasoline stations supplying E85 with 1,200 new stations scheduled to open in the next 18 months.  While the number of retail E85 suppliers has increased each year, this remains a relatively small percentage of the total number of U.S. retail gasoline stations, which is approximately 170,000.  In order for E85 fuel to increase demand for ethanol, it must be available for consumers to purchase it.  As public awareness of ethanol and E85 increases along with E85’s increased availability, management anticipates some growth in demand for ethanol associated with increased E85 consumption.The USDA provides financial assistance to help implement “blender pumps” in the United States in order to increase demand for ethanol and to help offset the cost of introducing mid-level ethanol blends into the United States retail gasoline market. A blender pump is a gasoline pump that can dispense a variety of different ethanol/gasoline blends. Blender pumps typically can dispense E10, E20, E30, E40, E50 and E85. These blender pumps accomplish these different ethanol/gasoline 
13

blends by internally mixing ethanol and gasoline which are held in separate tanks at the retail gas stations. Many in the ethanol industry believe that increased use of blender pumps will increase demand for ethanol by allowing gasoline retailers to provide various mid-level ethanol blends in a cost effective manner and allowing consumers with flex-fuel vehicles to purchase more ethanol through these mid-level blends. 
Changes in Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards have also benefited the ethanol industry by encouraging use of E85 fuel products. CAFE provides an effective 54% efficiency bonus to flexible-fuel vehicles running on E85. This variance encourages auto manufacturers to build more flexible-fuel models, particularly in trucks and sport utility vehicles that are otherwise unlikely to meet CAFE standards.
E15

E15 is a blend of higher octane gasoline and up to 15% ethanol.  E15 was approved for use in model year 2001 and newer cars, light-duty trucks, medium-duty passenger vehicles (SUVs) and all flex-fuel vehicles by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2012, This approved group of vehicles includes 80% of the cars, trucks and SUVs on the road today According to the Renewable Fuel Association, this higher octane fuel is available in 23 states at retail fueling stations. Sheetz, Kum & Go, Murphy USA, MAPCO Express, Protec Fuel, Minnoco, Thornton's and Hy-Vee all offer E15 to 2001 and newer vehicles today at several stations. According to Growth Energy, as of October 5, 2017, there were 1,043 retail stations selling E15 which is a substantial increase from the 431 stations selling E15 as of December 31, 2016.
In May 2015, the USDA announced that the agency will make significant investments in a biofuels infrastructure partnership to double the number of renewable fuel blender pumps that can supply consumers with higher ethanol blends, like E15 and E85. The program provides competitive grants, matched by states, to help implement “blender pumps” in the United States in order to increase demand for ethanol and to help offset the cost of introducing mid-level ethanol blends into the United States retail gasoline market. A blender pump is a gasoline pump that can dispense a variety of different ethanol/gasoline blends. Blender pumps typically can dispense E10, E15, E20, E30, E40, E50 and E85. These blender pumps accomplish these different ethanol/gasoline blends by internally mixing ethanol and gasoline which are held in separate tanks at the retail gas stations. Many in the ethanol industry believe that increased use of blender pumps will increase demand for ethanol by allowing gasoline retailers to provide various mid-level ethanol blends in a cost effective manner and allowing consumers with flex-fuel vehicles to purchase more ethanol through these mid-level blends. However, the expense of blender pumps has delayed their availability in the retail gasoline market. As of March 2017, the USDA biofuels infrastructure partnership program had provided $210 million to fund the installation of new ethanol infrastructure at more than 1,400 stations in 20 states. Installations began in 2016 and will continue into 2017, which will significantly increase the number of stations selling both E15 and E85.
Cellulosic Ethanol

The Energy Independence and Security Act provided numerous funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol. In addition, RFS2 mandates an increasing level of production of biofuels which are not derived from corn. These policies suggest an increasing policy preference away from corn ethanol and toward cellulosic ethanol. 
Environmental and Other Regulations and Permits
Ethanol production involves the emission of various airborne pollutants, including particulate matters, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds and sulfur dioxide.  Ethanol production also requires the use of significant volumes of water, a portion of which is treated and discharged into the environment.  We are required to maintain various environmental and operating permits.  Even though we have successfully acquired the permits necessary for our operations, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources on complying with such regulations.  In addition, if we sought to expand the Facility’s capacity in the future, above our current 140 million gallons, we would likely be required to acquire additional regulatory permits and could also be required to install additional pollution control equipment.   Our failure to obtain and maintain any environmental and/or operating permits currently required or which may be required in the future could force us to make material changes to our Facility or to shut down altogether.  
The U.S. Supreme Court has classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions. As stated above, we believe the final RFS2 regulations grandfather our plant at its current operating capacity, though expansion of our plant will need to meet a threshold of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions from a baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS2 mandate. In order to 
14

expand capacity at our plant above our current permitted 140 million gallons, we will be required to obtain additional permits and install improved technology.
Separately, the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") has adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (the "LCFS") requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissions from transportation fuels by 2020 using a lifecycle GHG emissions calculation. On December 29, 2011, a federal district court in California ruled that the California LCFS was unconstitutional which halted implementation of the California LCFS. CARB appealed this court ruling and on September 18, 2013, the federal appellate court reversed the federal district court finding the LCFS constitutional and remanding the case back to federal district court to determine whether the LCFS imposes a burden on interstate commerce that is excessive in light of the local benefits. On June 30, 2014, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal of the federal appellate court ruling and CARB recently re-adopted the LCFS with some slight modifications. The LCFS could have a negative impact on the overall market demand for corn-based ethanol and result in decreased ethanol prices. 
Part of our business is regulated by environmental laws and regulations governing the labeling, use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials. Other examples of government policies that can have an impact on our business include tariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions and outright embargos.
We also employ maintenance and operations personnel at our Facility. In addition to the attention that we place on the health and safety of our employees, the operations at our Facility are governed by the regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA.
We have obtained all of the necessary permits to operate the plant. Although we have been successful in obtaining all of the permits currently required, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources in complying with such regulations.
