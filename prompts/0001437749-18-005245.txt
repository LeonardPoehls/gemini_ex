Overview
 
Kona Grill, Inc. (referred to herein as the “Company” or “we,” “us,” and “our”) currently owns and operates 46 upscale casual restaurants in 23 states and Puerto Rico. In addition, we have three international restaurants that operate under franchise agreements. Our restaurants offer freshly prepared food, attentive service, and an upscale contemporary ambience that create an exceptional, yet affordable dining experience that we believe exceeds many traditional casual dining restaurants with whom we compete. Our restaurants feature a global menu of contemporary American favorites, award-winning sushi and craft cocktails. Our menu items are prepared from scratch at each restaurant location and incorporate over 40 signature sauces and dressings, creating memorable flavor profiles that appeal to a diverse group of customers. Our diverse menu is complemented by a full service bar offering a broad assortment of wines, craft cocktails, and beers. We believe that our innovative high-quality recipes, generous portions, and flexible price points provide customers with a compelling value proposition and allow us to attract a diverse customer base.
 
Our restaurants seat an average of 290 customers and are comprised of multiple dining areas that incorporate modern design elements to create an upscale ambience that reinforces our high standards of food and service. Our main dining area, full-service bar, indoor/outdoor patio, and sushi bar provide a choice of atmospheres and a variety of environments designed to attract new customers and encourage repeat visits from regular customers. We build our restaurants in high-activity areas such as retail centers, shopping malls, and lifestyle centers that are situated near commercial office space and residential housing to attract customers throughout the day.
 
The portability of our concept has been successfully demonstrated in a variety of markets across the United States (U.S.). Our long-term plans include strategically expanding the Kona Grill concept in both domestic and international markets. During 2017, we opened one restaurant in Scottsdale, Arizona and our franchise partners opened the first international Kona Grill restaurants in Vaughan (Toronto), Canada; Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Monterrey, Mexico.
Competitive Strengths
 
The restaurant business is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and location. We believe that the key strengths of our business include the following:
 

● | Innovative Menu Selections with Mainstream Appeal. We offer a menu of freshly prepared, high quality food that includes a diverse selection of contemporary American favorites and award-winning sushi items to appeal to a wide range of tastes, preferences, and price points. We prepare our dishes from scratch at each restaurant location using original recipes with generous portions and creative and appealing presentations. Our more than 40 signature sauces and dressings create memorable flavor profiles and further differentiate our menu items. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Distinctive Upscale Casual Dining Experience. Our creative menu, personalized service, and contemporary restaurant design blend together to create an inviting upscale casual dining experience. We design our restaurants with a unique layout and utilize modern, eye-catching design elements to enhance the customer experience. Our multiple dining areas provide customers with many distinct dining environments and atmospheres to suit a range of dining occasions. Our open exhibition-style kitchen and sushi bar further emphasize the quality and freshness of our food that are the cornerstones of our concept.


● | Significant Bar and Happy Hour Business. Our high-energy bar and patio offer a distinctive atmosphere where customers can enjoy our alcoholic beverage offerings. Our patio is a popular place for customers to enjoy our high-value happy hour and reverse happy hour offerings, where full portions of select items are offered at reduced price points. Our patio, which is enclosed in colder climate locations, provides a year-round sales opportunity and is a key driver in generating business during non-traditional periods. Aggregate revenue during these non-peak periods accounted for 23.3% of our total sales during 2017, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.

● | Personalized Customer Service. Our commitment to make every experience exceptional reinforces our upscale ambience and helps distinguish us from other casual dining restaurants. We train our service personnel to be friendly and knowledgeable about all aspects of the restaurant, which helps us provide personalized customer service that is designed to ensure an enjoyable dining experience and exceed our customers’ expectations. Our kitchen staff completes extensive training to ensure that menu items are precisely prepared to provide a consistent experience. We believe our focus on high service standards underscores our customer-centric philosophy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Multiple Daypart Model. Our appetizers, entrees, and sushi offerings provide a flexible selection of items that can be ordered individually or shared allowing customers to dine with us during traditional lunch and dinner meal periods as well as between customary dining periods such as in the late afternoon and late night. The lively ambience of our patio and bar areas provides an energetic ambience as well as provides a unique atmosphere for customers to enjoy before or after they dine with us. Our sushi bar provides another dining venue for customers while offering a wide selection of creative and flavorful menu items for health-conscious customers. We believe that our ability to attract customers throughout the day distinguishes us from many other casual dining chains.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Attractive Unit Economics. During 2017, the average unit volume of our comparable base restaurants was $4.1 million. We believe our high average unit volume helps us attract high-quality employees, leverage fixed costs, and makes us a desirable tenant for landlords. We expect the average cash investment for new restaurants to be approximately $2.6 million, net of landlord tenant improvement allowances and excluding preopening expenses. Based on historical experience, restaurants that are subject to ground leases and do not receive landlord tenant improvement allowances may require a significantly higher cash investment, but typically have lower average rental costs over the duration of the lease.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategy
 
We have grown significantly over the past several years. Starting in 2017 we have pursued more modest growth to give our existing base of restaurants the opportunity to mature. We continue to believe that there will be significant long-term opportunities to grow our sales and increase our brand awareness throughout the United States and internationally. The following sets forth the key elements of our growth strategy.
Pursue Disciplined Restaurant Growth When Appropriate
 
Historically, we have reviewed potential sites in both new and existing markets that meet our target customer demographics, real estate, and investment return criteria. We believe the location of our restaurants plays a pivotal role in determining the long-term profitability of each restaurant and, accordingly, we have spent significant time and resources to evaluate each prospective site. We utilize a disciplined site selection process involving our management team and Board of Directors. Our site selection criteria for new restaurants has included selecting sites near high activity areas such as lifestyle centers. In addition, we have focused on areas that have above-average density and income populations, have high customer traffic throughout the day from thriving businesses or retail markets, and are convenient for and appealing to business and leisure travelers. We have also focused on sites that have great visibility and ample parking to support high volumes of traffic.
 
Over the past four years, we have grown organically through opening new restaurants and doubled the number of domestic restaurants during this time from 23 to 46. Our unit growth rate was 22% in 2016, with eight openings during the year and we had 23% unit growth in 2015 with seven restaurant openings. We opened only one domestic restaurant in 2017. We believe that a modest growth rate over the next few years will allow us to focus our time and attention on restaurant operations and improving financial performance. 
 
 2



We continue to execute our strategy for international market expansion. As there is increased demand for upscale casual dining concepts overseas, we believe there is a significant opportunity to expand our concept in Canada, Latin America, the Middle East and beyond. In 2016, we signed agreements for the development of six Kona Grill restaurants in Mexico and six Kona Grill restaurants in the United Arab Emirates. In April 2017, we signed an agreement for the development of one Kona Grill restaurant in Vaughan (Toronto), Canada. The agreement allows our franchisee the right to develop additional restaurants in the Toronto market for a specified period of time following the opening of the first restaurant. Each of our three international franchise partners opened a Kona Grill restaurant in their respective countries in the second half of 2017.
Pursue Growth in Existing Restaurant Sales 
 
Our goal for existing restaurants is to increase unit volumes through consistent execution of our food and drink offerings; however our same store sales decreased in 2017 after six straight years of growth. We are focused on key initiatives designed to drive traffic, increase sales and enhance the customer experience while building our business for long-term growth. We have enhanced our cocktail and wine list and continue to utilize our Wine Down Wednesday offering to drive customer traffic by offering a 50% discount on bottle wines each Wednesday. We offer online ordering for the convenience of our customers and have also partnered with several companies for delivery services to drive incremental sales growth. We believe the strength of our differentiated concept and the appeal of our contemporary design enables us to gain market share. Furthermore, we continue to focus on the quality of our service and hospitality with extensive training for our service staff on our menu offerings. We continue to grow our customer loyalty program, Konavore™, which has grown to over 338,000 members. We utilize this e-mail based program to communicate new menu offerings, restaurant specific events, and other marketing messages to keep Kona Grill top of mind for consumers. We have also increased our presence in social marketing and engaging with customers through various social media. 
Continue Strategic Investments in Personnel and Systems
 
We believe that successful execution of our growth strategies for our existing restaurants will enable Kona Grill to be a leading upscale casual dining restaurant operator in the U.S. We have made strategic personnel investments and will make incremental investments over the long-term to support the growth of the Kona Grill brand both domestically and internationally. Additionally, we continue to implement software and tools to enhance our business while ensuring that strong financial controls are in place to minimize risks associated with our growth strategy. 
Unit Economics
 
We target a 30% net cash-on-cash return for our restaurants once they reach their mature level of operations. Maturation periods vary from restaurant to restaurant, but generally range from two to four years. The cash-based performance target for our operating restaurant operations does not include field supervision, corporate support expenses, preopening expenses, or non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization; and does not represent a targeted return on investment in our common stock.
 
Our investment cost for new restaurants varies significantly depending upon the location of the restaurant, the type of lease entered into and the amount of tenant improvement allowance we receive from landlords. We expect the cash investment cost of our prototype restaurant on average to be approximately $2.6 million, net of landlord tenant improvement allowances averaging between $0.7 million and $1.2 million, and excluding cash preopening expenses of approximately $450,000. 
 
Our ability to generate sales throughout the day is a key strength of our concept. The following table depicts the amount and percentage of contribution for each daypart of overall revenues during 2017.

Menu
 
Our menu features a wide selection of appetizers, salads, soups, flatbreads, sandwiches, noodles, seafood, signature entrees, and desserts. Our appetizers include socially interactive items that can be eaten individually or easily shared among customers. Our signature entrees feature various sauces and offer customers generous portions that are impressive in presentation and in taste. For example, our most popular entrée is the Macadamia Nut Chicken served with shoyu-cream sauce and accompanied by parmesan garlic mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables. Other favorites include Miso-Sake Sea Bass served with shrimp and pork fried rice and a seasonal vegetable and Pan-Seared Ahi served with steamed white rice, baby bok choy and a sweet chili sauce. 
We also offer an extensive assortment of sushi that includes traditional favorites as well as distinctive specialty sushi and sashimi items such as our Voodoo Roll made with spicy crawfish mix and avocado rolled inside of seaweed and topped with a habanero tuna mix and chili masago, or the Bama Roll made with crab mix, cream cheese and jalapeno in soy paper topped with tuna, avocado, fish roe and spicy mayo. Sushi sales accounted for 27.2% of our total revenue during 2017. 
 
Our menu, coupled with an expansive selection of sushi, offers ample choices for health-conscious customers. We take great pride in providing our customers the full Kona Grill experience without compromising their dietary needs and restrictions. We offer extensive gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan menus. We also feature a bento box with a variety of selections of protein and side dishes for the enjoyment of our young customers.
 
Each of our restaurants has a dedicated kitchen staff member, whom we refer to as our saucier, to oversee the preparation of more than 40 signature sauces and dressings that are made from scratch using only high-quality ingredients and fresh products. Each sauce is designed according to a proprietary recipe for specific menu items and includes unique flavors and combinations such as our honey cilantro, shoyu-cream, and spicy aioli dipping sauces, and our sesame-soy and honey dijon salad dressings. We believe that these distinctive sauces and dressings provide a unique flavor profile, which further distinguishes Kona Grill from its competitors. 
 
The versatility of our menu enables us to provide customers with dishes that can be enjoyed outside of the traditional lunch and dinner meal periods, as well as to serve our customers’ requirements for a variety of dining occasions, including everyday dining, business lunches, social gatherings and special occasions. We also offer catering, group dining menus, and sushi platters to provide additional opportunities to serve our customers’ needs. In general, our menu is consistent from location to location. We typically update our menu in the spring and the fall and make enhancements to existing items or introduce new items based on customer feedback, which helps ensure that we are meeting the needs of our customers.
 
Our restaurants also offer an extensive selection of bottled and draft beers, wines by the glass or bottle, sake and an extensive selection of liquors and craft cocktail drinks. Alcoholic beverage sales represented approximately 27.3% of our total revenue during 2017.

Decor and Atmosphere
 
We design our restaurants to offer customers a unique dining experience in a setting that is relevant for today and tomorrow. Each of our restaurants is designed with a contemporary look that is adaptable to varying real estate opportunities while incorporating signature elements such as multiple dining areas and open floor plan. Customers can expect to find a warm and inviting atmosphere that aligns with our innovative food and drink offerings and high-quality service. The layout of our restaurants focuses on creating multiple dining areas for our customers while maintaining an open atmosphere that allows customers to have a panoramic view of the entire restaurant and exhibition kitchen and sushi bar. We utilize a variety of directional lighting styles and design elements to add warmth to all dining spaces throughout our restaurants. 
 
Regardless of the experience customers are looking for, our restaurant design offers a variety of dining experiences to fit every mood and occasion. Our indoor/outdoor patio with a full-service bar incorporates a high-energy, socially interactive atmosphere for customers to enjoy appetizers or sushi while they wait to dine with us, and serves as a destination for many of our frequent customers during the late afternoon and late-night periods. Certain of our locations offer private dining rooms for parties, special occasions and business events. Additionally, three of our restaurants feature a rooftop patio and we enclose patios in colder climates to maximize utilization of the patio throughout the year. Alternatively, our dining room provides a warm and intimate ambience for special occasions or dinner with friends and family. For sushi enthusiasts, we showcase our highly trained sushi chefs creating their masterpieces at our expansive sushi bar. 
 
Food Preparation, Quality Control, and Purchasing

We believe that we have some of the highest food quality standards in the industry. Our standards are designed to protect food products throughout the preparation process. We provide detailed specifications to suppliers for food ingredients, products, and supplies. We strive to maintain quality and consistency in our restaurants through careful hiring, training and supervision of personnel. We require annual recertification training for all employees, and each employee receives extensive training relating to food and beverage preparation and restaurant operations. We also instruct kitchen managers and staff on safety, sanitation, housekeeping, repair and maintenance, product and service specifications, ordering and receiving products, and quality assurance. All of our restaurant managers are compliant with Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point, or HACCP, requirements. We monitor minimum cook temperature requirements and conduct twice-a-day kitchen and food quality inspections to further assure the safety and quality of all of the items we use in our restaurants. We have a ServSafe alcohol certification program, where every front of house employee is trained and tested to ensure we are providing responsible alcohol service. Further, to monitor and ensure compliance with required guidelines, we evaluate all of our employees on their ability to maintain sanitary conditions in their respective restaurants. 
 
We source our products and supplies with reputable and high-quality providers that are capable of providing consistent, reliable distribution to all of our restaurants. We have arrangements with national and local distributors and specialty food suppliers who provide high-quality ingredients and perishable food products. These distributors and suppliers are required to comply with food safety guidelines mandated by HACCP, the Food & Drug Administration and local statutes and regulations of the particular state, county or municipality. 
 
Our goal is to maximize purchasing efficiencies and obtain the lowest possible prices for ingredients, products, and supplies, while maintaining the highest quality. We are committed to purchasing high-quality ingredients for our restaurants at reasonable prices. We use fresh ingredients and, as a result, we maintain only modest inventories. We believe that competitively priced alternative distribution sources are available should those channels be necessary. We negotiate national supply contracts and prices for food supply throughout all of our restaurants, monitor quality control and consistency of the food supplied to restaurants, and oversee delivery of food on a nationwide basis. In order to provide the freshest ingredients and products, and to maximize operating efficiencies between purchase and usage, we utilize an automated food cost and inventory system to assist each restaurant’s management team in determining daily order requirements for food ingredients, products, and supplies. The management team orders accordingly from approved suppliers, and all deliveries are inspected to assure that the items received meet our quality specifications and negotiated prices.

Restaurant Operations
 
Executive and Restaurant Management
 
Our executive management team continually monitors restaurant operations to assure the quality of products and services and the maintenance of facilities. We have procedures to enhance efficiency, reduce costs and provide centralized and individual restaurant support systems. Our corporate operations team and directors of operation have primary responsibility for oversight of our restaurants and analyze restaurant-level performance and strategic planning. We currently employ six directors of operations who are each responsible for overseeing the restaurants in a specific region. The directors of operations’ responsibilities include supporting the general managers and helping each restaurant achieve the sales and cash flow targets for their restaurant as well as providing insight for decision making in such areas as food and beverage, people development, and process improvements to enhance the efficiency of operations and the dining experience for our customers. 
 
Our typical restaurant management team consists of a general manager, executive chef, sous chef and two to three additional managers depending upon the sales volume of each restaurant. Our restaurants employ on average approximately 75 non-management employees, many of whom work part-time. The general manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the restaurant, including the hiring, training, personnel development, execution of local marketing programs, and operating results. The chefs are responsible for overseeing the preparation of kitchen and sushi items, maintaining product quality, and closely monitoring food costs and department labor costs. 
 
Training
 
In order to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants, we carefully train and supervise restaurant personnel and adhere to high standards related to personnel performance, food and beverage preparation, and maintenance of our restaurants. All of our restaurant personnel participate in both initial and ongoing training programs under the direction of our director of training. Each restaurant manager completes a formal training program that is comprised of a mix of online and on-the-job instruction. The training covers all aspects of management philosophy and overall restaurant operations, including supervisory skills, operating and performance standards, accounting procedures, IT systems and employee selection and training necessary for top-quality restaurant operations. The training programs also involve intensive understanding of our menu and other key service protocols. 
Recruitment and Retention
 
Our future growth and success is highly dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain qualified individuals who are capable of successfully managing our high-volume, upscale casual restaurants. We believe that our high unit volume, the image and atmosphere of the Kona Grill concept, and career advancement and employee benefit programs enable us to attract high quality management and restaurant personnel. We offer restaurant management personnel competitive wages and benefits, including medical insurance and participation in our 401(k) plan with a company match. We motivate and prepare our restaurant personnel by providing them with opportunities for increased responsibility and advancement through a formal management development program. Furthermore, the management team of each restaurant shares in a bonus tied to the sales and overall profitability of their restaurant. We believe that our compensation package for managers and restaurant employees is comparable to or better than those provided by other upscale casual restaurants. We believe our compensation policies help us attract quality personnel.
 
 6



Information Systems
 
We believe that our management information systems enable us to increase the speed and accuracy of order-taking and pricing, efficiently schedule labor to better serve customers, monitor labor costs, assist in product purchasing and menu mix management, promptly access financial and operating data, and improve the accuracy and efficiency of restaurant-level information and reporting.
 
We utilize an integrated information system to manage the flow of information within each of our restaurants and between each restaurant and our corporate office. This system includes a point-of-sale (POS) local area network that helps facilitate the operations of the restaurant by recording sales transactions and printing orders in the appropriate locations within the restaurant. Additionally, we utilize the POS system to authorize, batch, and transmit credit card transactions, record employee time clock information, and produce a variety of management reports. The POS is integrated with food cost and labor scheduling software as well as our accounting system and incorporates a redundancy and back-up emergency operating plan on a temporary basis if the system experiences downtime.
 
We transmit electronically select information that is captured from the POS system to our corporate office on a daily basis. This information flow enables senior management to monitor operating results with daily and weekly sales analysis, detailed labor and food cost information, and comparisons between actual and budgeted operating results. We continually evaluate both our restaurant information systems and corporate office information systems to enhance operations. We believe our information systems are secure and scalable as we continue to build our brand.
Advertising and Marketing

Our ongoing advertising and marketing strategy consists of a loyalty program, social media, grass-root local marketing, various public relations activities and word-of-mouth recommendations. We believe that these mediums are key components in driving customer trial and repeat usage. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in marketing and branding efforts, primarily to increase revenue and expand brand awareness.
 
We implement a coordinated public relations effort in conjunction with each new restaurant opening. Approximately 60 days before a scheduled restaurant opening, we collaborate with the local media to publicize our restaurant and generate awareness of our brand. This effort is usually supplemented by targeted marketing campaigns, social media and other marketing efforts, including hosting a high-profile event in which we invite local leaders and community members as part of our preopening practice activities to introduce our concept to the local market. In addition, we use various social media platforms and our website, www.konagrill.com, to promote brand awareness.
 
Competition
 
The restaurant industry is highly competitive. Key competitive factors in the industry include the taste, quality, and price of food and drink offerings, quality and speed of customer service, brand name recognition, attractiveness of facilities, restaurant location, customer convenience and overall dining experience.
 
We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors, as follows:
 

● | We offer a global menu of contemporary American favorites, award-winning sushi items and specialty cocktails; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants through the careful training and supervision of restaurant personnel and adherence to high standards related to personnel performance, food and beverage preparation, and maintenance of our restaurants;


● | Our innovative menu with attractive price points, attentive service, and contemporary restaurant design with multiple environments blend together to create our upscale casual dining experience and enables us to attract a broad customer demographic.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We offer online ordering through our website, catering and group dining menus, and partner with third parties for delivery service of our food and drink offerings.

Although we believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors, there are a substantial number of restaurants and food service providers that compete directly and indirectly with us, many of which have significantly greater financial resources, higher revenue, and greater economies of scale. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns; national and regional employment statistics; demographic trends; weather conditions; the cost and availability of raw materials, labor, and energy; purchasing power; governmental regulations; and local competitive factors. Any change in these or other related factors or negative publicity relating to food safety could adversely affect our restaurant operations. Accordingly, we must constantly evolve and refine the critical elements of our restaurant concept over time to protect their longer-term competitiveness. Additionally, there is competition for highly qualified restaurant management employees and for attractive locations suitable for upscale, high volume restaurants.
 
Trademarks
 
We have registered the service marks “Kona Grill” and “Konavore” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and “Kona Grill” in certain foreign jurisdictions. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights, such as our distinctive menu offerings and signature sauce recipes, have significant value and are important to the marketing of our concept. We have protected in the past and will continue to vigorously protect our proprietary rights. We cannot predict, however, whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights or the use by others of restaurant features based upon, or otherwise similar to, our concept. It may be difficult for us to prevent others from copying elements of our concept and any litigation to enforce our rights will likely be costly. In addition, other local restaurant companies with names similar to ours may try to prevent us from using our marks in those locales.
Government Regulation
 
Each of our restaurants is subject to licensing and regulation by state and local departments and bureaus of alcohol control, health, sanitation, zoning, and fire and to periodic review by state and municipal authorities for areas in which the restaurants are located. In addition, we are subject to local land use, zoning, building, planning, and traffic ordinances and regulations in the selection and acquisition of suitable sites for developing new restaurants. Delays in obtaining, or denials of, or revocation or temporary suspension of, necessary licenses or approvals could have a material adverse impact on our restaurant development. 
 
Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities for a license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be subject to penalties, temporary suspension or revocation for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations impact many aspects of the daily operations of our restaurants, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. We have not encountered any material problems relating to alcoholic beverage licenses or permits to date. The failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain its liquor license would adversely affect that restaurant’s operations and profitability.
 
We are subject to “dram shop” statutes in most of the states in which we operate. Those statutes generally provide a person who has been injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to such person. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance which we believe is consistent with coverage in the full-service restaurant industry. Even though we carry liquor liability insurance, a judgment against us under a “dram shop” statute in excess of our liability coverage could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 
 8



Our operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship requirements, and overtime. Several states have set minimum wage rates higher than the current federal level. A significant number of hourly personnel at our restaurants are paid at rates related to state and federal minimum wage laws and, accordingly, state minimum wage increases implemented during the last several years have increased our labor costs. Increases in the minimum wage rate or the cost of workers’ compensation insurance, changes in tip-credit provisions, employee benefit costs (including costs associated with mandated health insurance coverage), or other costs associated with employees could adversely affect our operating results. To our knowledge, we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal, state, and local laws affecting our business.
 
Employees
 
As of February 28, 2018, we employed 3,638 people of whom 3,588 worked in our restaurants and 50 were employed at our corporate office. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a major work stoppage, strike, or labor dispute. We consider our relations with our employees to be favorable.
Access to Information
 
Our website is located at www.konagrill.com. The information on our website is not part of this filing. Through our website, we make available free of charge our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
