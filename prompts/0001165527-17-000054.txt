Item 1 - Business
General
 
Eight Dragons Company (Company), formerly known as Tahoe Pacific Corporation, Pacific Holdings, Inc. and Ameri-First Financial Group, respectively, was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 27, 1996.
 
On October 24, 2007, the Company changed its state of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada by means of a merger with and into Eight Dragons Company, a Nevada corporation formed on September 26, 2007 solely for the purpose of effecting the reincorporation.  The merger was consummated through an exchange of 100 shares in the Nevada corporation for each share then issued and outstanding in the Delaware corporation.  The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Nevada corporation are the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the surviving corporation.  Such Articles of Incorporation modified the Company’s capital structure to allow for the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value common stock and up to 50,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value preferred stock.
 
For periods prior to 2000, the Company participated in numerous unsuccessful ventures and corporate name changes, as have been disclosed and discussed in greater detail in previous Annual Report(s) on Form 10-K and/or  Form 10-KSB which were filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Since 2000, the Company has had no operations, significant assets or liabilities.
 
Currently, the Company has no known exposures to any current or proposed climate change legislation which could negatively impact the Company’s operations or require capital expenditures to become compliant.
 
Current Status
 
The Company’s current business plan is to contemplate a possible future merger by the Company and either an affiliated entity or an as yet unknown other entity.
 
The Company’s common stock is currently quoted on the QB tier of the OTC Markets under the ticker symbol “EDRG”.
 
Since the disposition of all operating assets and operations in 2000, the Company may be referred to as a reporting shell corporation. Shell corporations have zero or nominal assets and typically no stated or contingent liabilities.  Private companies wishing to become publicly trading may wish to merge with a shell (a reverse merger or reverse acquisition) whereby the shareholders of the private company become the majority of the shareholders of the combined company.  The private company may purchase for cash all or a portion of the common shares of the shell corporation from its major stockholders.  Typically, the Board and officers of the private company become the new Board and officers of the combined Company and often the name of the private company becomes the name of the combined entity.

The Company has very limited capital, and it is unlikely that the Company will be able to take advantage of more than one such business opportunity.  The Company intends to seek opportunities demonstrating the potential of long-term growth as opposed to short-term earnings. However, at the present time, the Company has not identified any business opportunity that it plans to pursue, nor has the Company reached any agreement or definitive understanding with any person concerning an acquisition.

It is anticipated that the Company’s officers and directors will contact broker-dealers and other persons with whom they are acquainted who are involved with corporate finance matters to advise them of the Company’s existence and to determine if any companies or businesses that they represent have a general interest in considering a merger or acquisition with a blind pool or blank check or shell entity.  No direct discussions regarding the possibility of merger are expected to occur until after the effective date of this registration statement.  No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in finding or acquiring a desirable business opportunity, given the limited funds that are expected to be available for acquisitions.  Furthermore, no assurance can be given that any acquisition, which does occur, will be on terms that are favorable to the Company or its current stockholders.
 
The Company’s search will be directed toward small and medium-sized enterprises, which have a desire to become public corporations.  In addition these enterprises may wish to satisfy, either currently or in the reasonably near future, the minimum tangible asset requirement in order to qualify shares for trading on NASDAQ or on an exchange such as the American Stock Exchange.  The Company anticipates that the business opportunities presented to it will (I) either be in the process of formation, or be recently organized with limited operating history or a history of losses attributable to under-capitalization or other factors; (ii) experiencing financial or operating difficulties; (iii) be in need of funds to develop new products or services or to expand into a new market, or have plans for rapid expansion through acquisition of competing businesses; (iv) or other similar characteristics.  The Company intends to concentrate its acquisition efforts on properties or businesses that it believes to be undervalued or that it believes may realize a substantial benefit from being publicly owned.  Given the above factors, investors should expect that any acquisition candidate may have little or no operating history, or a history of losses or low profitability.
 
The Company does not propose to restrict its search for investment opportunities to any particular geographical area or industry, and may, therefore, engage in essentially any business, to the extent of its limited resources.  This include industries such as service, finance, natural resources, manufacturing, high technology, product development, medical, communications and others.  The Company’s discretion in the selection of business opportunities is unrestricted, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions, and other factors.
 
Any entity that has an interest in being acquired by, or merging into the Company, is expected to be an entity that desires to become a public company and establish a public trading market for its securities. In connection with such a merger or acquisition, it is highly likely that an amount of stock constituting control of the Company would either be issued by the Company or be purchased from the current principal stockholders of the Company by the acquiring entity or its affiliates. If stock is purchased from the current principal stockholders, the transaction is likely to result in substantial gains to the current principal stockholders relative to their purchase price for such stock. In the Company’s judgment, none of the officers and directors would thereby become an underwriter within the meaning of the Section 2(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) as long as the transaction is a private transaction rather than a public distribution of securities. The sale of a controlling interest by certain principal shareholders of the Company would occur at a time when minority stockholders are unable to sell their shares because of the lack of a public market for such shares.
 
Depending upon the nature of the transaction, the current officers and directors of the Company may resign their management and board positions with the Company in connection with a change of control or acquisition of a business opportunity.  In the event of such a resignation, the Company’s current management would thereafter have no control over the conduct of the Company’s business.
 
It is anticipated that business opportunities will come to the Company’s attention from various sources, including its officers and directors, its other stockholders, professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community, and others who may present unsolicited proposals. The Company has no plan, understandings, agreements, or commitments with any individual for such person to act as a finder of opportunities for the Company.
 
Investigation and Selection of Business Opportunities with an Affiliated Entity or Other Potential Entities
 
To a large extent, a decision to participate in a specific business opportunity may be made upon management’s analysis of the quality of the other Company’s management and personnel, the anticipated acceptability of new products or marketing concepts, the merit of technological changes, the perceived benefit the business opportunity will derive from becoming a publicly held entity, and numerous other factors which are difficult, if not impossible, to analyze through the application of any objective criteria.  In many instances, it is anticipated that the historical operations of a specific business opportunity may not necessarily be indicative of the potential for the future because of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the possible need to expand substantially, shift marketing approaches, change product emphasis, change or substantially augment management, raise capital and the like.
 
It is anticipated that the Company will not be able to diversify, but will essentially be limited to the acquisition of one business opportunity because of the Company’s limited financing.  This lack of diversification will not permit the Company to offset potential losses from one business opportunity against profits from another, and should be considered an adverse factor affecting any decision to purchase the Company’s securities.

Certain types of business acquisition transactions may be completed without any requirement that the Company first submit the transaction to the stockholders for their approval.  In the event the proposed transaction is structured in such a fashion that stockholder approval is not required, holders of the Company’s securities (other than principal stockholders holding a controlling interest) should not anticipate that they will be provided with financial statements or any other documentation prior to the completion of the transaction.  Other types of transactions require prior approval of the stockholders.
 
In the event a proposed business combination or business acquisition transaction is structured in such a fashion that prior stockholder approval is necessary, the Company will be required to prepare a Proxy or Information Statement describing the proposed transaction, file it with the Securities and Exchange Commission for review and approval, and mail a copy of it to all Company stockholders prior to holding a stockholders meeting for purposes of voting on the proposal.  Minority shareholders that do not vote in favor of a proposed transaction will then have the right, in the event the transaction is approved by the required number of stockholders, to exercise statutory dissenter’s rights and elect to be paid the fair value of their shares.
 
The analysis of business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company’s officers and directors, none of whom are professional business analysts.  Although there are no current plans to do so, Company management might hire an outside consultant to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities, and might pay a finder’s fee.  Since Company management has no current plans to use any outside consultants or advisors to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities, no policies have been adopted regarding use of such consultants or advisors, the criteria to be used in selecting such consultants or advisors, the services to be provided, the term of service, or the total amount of fees that may be paid.  However, because of the limited resources of the Company, it is likely that any such fee the Company agrees to pay would be paid in stock and not in cash.
 
Otherwise, in analyzing potential business opportunities, Company management anticipates that it will consider, among other things, the following factors:
 
 
· | Potential for growth and profitability indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion, or new products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Company’s perception of how any particular business opportunity will be received by the investment community and by the Company’s stockholders;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Whether, following the business combination, the financial condition of the business opportunity would be, or would have a significant prospect in the foreseeable future of becoming, sufficient to enable the securities of the Company to qualify for listing on an exchange or on a national automated securities quotation system, such as NASDAQ, so as to permit the trading of such securities to be exempt from the requirements of Rule 15g-9 adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements, or from other sources;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | Competitive position as compared to other companies of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strength and diversity of existing management or management prospects that are scheduled for recruitment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potential; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance, and other required items.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In regard to the possibility that the shares of the Company would qualify for listing on NASDAQ, the current standards for initial listing include, among other requirements, that the Company (1) have net tangible assets of at least $4.0 million, or a market capitalization of $50.0 million, or net income of not less that $0.75 million in its latest fiscal year or in two of the last three fiscal years; (2) have a public float (i.e., shares that are not held by any officer, director or 10% stockholder) of at least 1.0 million shares; (3) have a minimum bid price of at least $4.00; (4) have at least 300 round lot stockholders (i.e., stockholders who own not less than 100 shares); and (5) have an operating history of at least one year or have a market capitalization of at least $50.0 million.  Many, and perhaps most, of the business opportunities that might be potential candidates for a combination with the Company would not satisfy the NASDAQ listing criteria.

No one of the factors described above will be controlling in the selection of a business opportunity, and management will attempt to analyze all factors appropriate to each opportunity and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data.  Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.  Potential investors must recognize that, because of the Company’s limited capital available for investigation and management’s limited experience in business analysis, the Company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired.
 
The Company is unable to predict when it may participate in a business opportunity.  It expects, however, that the analysis of specific proposals and the selection of a business opportunity may take several months or more.
 
Prior to making a decision to participate in a business opportunity, the Company will generally request that it be provided with written materials regarding the business opportunity containing as much relevant information as possible, including, but not limited to, such items as a description of products, services and Company history; management resumes; financial information; available projections, with related assumptions upon which they are based; an explanation of proprietary products and services; evidence of existing patents, trademarks, or service marks, or rights thereto; present and proposed forms of compensation to management; a description of transactions between such Company and its affiliates during the relevant periods; a description of present and required facilities; an analysis of risks and competitive conditions; a financial plan of operation and estimated capital requirements; audited financial statements, or if they are not available, unaudited financial statements, together with reasonable assurance that audited financial statements would be able to be produced within a reasonable period of time not to exceed 60 days following completion of a merger or acquisition transaction; and the like.
 
As part of the Company’s investigation, the Company’s executive officers and directors may meet personally with management and key personnel, may visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis or verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of the Company’s limited financial resources and management expertise.
 
It is possible that the range of business opportunities that might be available for consideration by the Company could be limited by the impact of Securities and Exchange Commission regulations regarding purchase and sale of penny stocks.  The regulations would affect, and possibly impair, any market that might develop in the Company’s securities until such time as they qualify for listing on NASDAQ or on an exchange which would make them exempt from applicability of the penny stock regulations.
 
Company management believes that various types of potential merger or acquisition candidates might find a business combination with the Company to be attractive.  These include acquisition candidates desiring to create a public market for their shares in order to enhance liquidity for current stockholders, acquisition candidates which have long-term plans for raising capital through public sale of securities and believe that the possible prior existence of a public market for their securities would be beneficial, and acquisition candidates which plan to acquire additional assets through issuance of securities rather than for cash, and believe that the possibility of development of a public market for their securities will be of assistance in that process.  Acquisition candidates, which have a need for an immediate cash infusion, are not likely to find a potential business combination with the Company to be an attractive alternative.
 
Form of Acquisition
 
It is impossible to predict the manner in which the Company may participate in a business opportunity.  Specific business opportunities will be reviewed as well as the respective needs and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity and, upon the basis of the review and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters, the legal structure or method deemed by management to be suitable will be selected.  Such structure may include, but is not limited to leases, purchase and sale agreements, licenses, joint ventures and other contractual arrangements.  The Company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation or other form of organization.  Implementing such structure may require the merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with other corporations or forms of business organization.  In addition, the present management and stockholders of the Company most likely will not have control of a majority of the voting stock of the Company following a merger or reorganization transaction.  As part of such a transaction, the Company’s existing directors may resign and new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.
 
It is likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of Common Stock or other securities of the Company.  Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called “B” tax free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, depends upon the issuance to the stockholders of the acquired Company of a controlling interest (i.e., 80% or more) of the common stock of the combined entities immediately following the reorganization.  If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other tax free provisions provided under the Internal Revenue Code, the Company’s current stockholders would retain in the aggregate 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares. This could result in substantial additional dilution in the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to such reorganization.  Any such issuance of additional shares might also be done simultaneously with a sale or transfer of shares representing a controlling interest in the Company by the current officers, directors and principal stockholders.

It is anticipated that any new securities issued in any reorganization would be issued in reliance upon one or more exemptions from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws to the extent that such exemptions are available.  In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of the transaction, the Company may agree to register such securities either at the time the transaction is consummated or under certain conditions at specified times thereafter.  The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market that might develop in the Company’s securities may have a depressive effect upon such market.
 
The Company will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of a written agreement.  Although the terms of such agreement cannot be predicted, generally such an agreement would require specific representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto, specify certain events of default, detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties thereto prior to such closing, outline the manner of bearing costs if the transaction is not closed, set forth remedies upon default, and include miscellaneous other terms.
 
As a general matter, the Company anticipates that it, and/or its principal stockholders will enter into a letter of intent with the management, principals or owners of a prospective business opportunity prior to signing a binding agreement.  Such a letter of intent will set forth the terms of the proposed acquisition but will not bind any of the parties to consummate the transaction.  Execution of a letter of intent will by no means indicate that consummation of an acquisition is probable.  Neither the Company nor any of the other parties to the letter of intent will be bound to consummate the acquisition unless and until a definitive agreement is executed.  Even after a definitive agreement is executed, it is possible that the acquisition would not be consummated should any party elect to exercise any right provided in the agreement to terminate it on specific grounds.
 
It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others.  If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable.  Moreover, because many providers of goods and services require compensation at the time or soon after the goods and services are provided, the inability of the Company to pay until an indeterminate future time may make it impossible to produce goods and services.
 
Investment Company Act and Other Regulation
 
The Company may participate in a business opportunity by purchasing, trading or selling the securities of such business.  The Company does not, however, intend to engage primarily in such activities.  Specifically, the Company intends to conduct its activities so as to avoid being classified as an investment Company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Act), and therefore to avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
 
The Company’s plan of business may involve changes in its capital structure, management, control and business, especially if it consummates the reorganization as discussed above.  Each of these areas is regulated by the Investment Act, in order to protect purchasers of investment Company securities. Since the Company will not register as an investment Company, stockholders will not be afforded these protections.
 
Competition
 
The Company expects to encounter substantial competition in its efforts to locate attractive business combination opportunities.  The competition may in part come from business development companies, venture capital partnerships and corporations, small investment companies, brokerage firms, and the like.  Some of these types of organizations are likely to be in a better position than the Company to obtain access to attractive business acquisition candidates either because they have greater experience, resources and managerial capabilities than the Company, because they are able to offer immediate access to limited amounts of cash, or for a variety of other reasons.  The Company also will experience competition from other public companies with similar business purposes, some of which may also have funds available for use by an acquisition candidate.
Employees
 
The Company currently has no employees.  Management of the Company expects to use consultants, attorneys and accountants as necessary, and does not anticipate a need to engage any full-time employees so long as it is seeking and evaluating business opportunities.  The need for employees and their availability will be addressed in connection with the decision whether or not to acquire or participate in specific business opportunities.
