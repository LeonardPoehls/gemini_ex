ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Telenav is a leading provider of location-based products and services for connected cars and advertising. We utilize our connected car platform and our advertising platform to deliver these products and services. Our connected car platform allows us to deliver enhanced location-based navigation services to automobile manufacturers and tier one suppliers, or tier ones. Our advertising platform, which we provide through our Thinknear subsidiary, leverages our location expertise and delivers highly targeted advertising services to advertisers and advertising agencies. We report results in three business segments: automotive, advertising and mobile navigation. Our fiscal year ends June 30. In this Form 10-K, we refer to the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and ending June 30, 2019 as fiscal 2016, fiscal 2017, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, respectively. Our total revenue was $183.3 million in fiscal 2016, $169.6 million in fiscal 2017 and $106.2 million in fiscal 2018. Our net loss was $35.3 million in fiscal 2016, $47.3 million in fiscal 2017 and $89.1 million in fiscal 2018.
We derive revenue primarily from automobile manufacturers and tier ones, advertisers and advertising agencies. We receive revenue from automobile manufacturers and tier ones whose vehicles or systems incorporate our proprietary personalized navigation software and services. These manufacturers and tier ones generally do not provide us with any volume or revenue guarantees. In addition, we have a strategic business in mobile advertising where our customers are primarily advertising agencies, which represent national and regional brands, and channel partners, which work closely with local and small business advertisers.
Our legacy mobile navigation business has declined steadily since fiscal 2013, and we expect it to continue to decline and represent less than 10% of our consolidated revenue commencing in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We began offering our mobile navigation services in 2003. Our mobile navigation business generates revenue from our partnerships with wireless carriers who sell our navigation services to their subscribers either as a standalone service or in a bundle with other data or services. The mobile navigation business has declined both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue from $116.4 million, or 61% of our revenue, in fiscal 2013 to $13.4 million, or 12% of our revenue, in fiscal 2018, as subscriptions for paid navigation services declined in favor of free or freemium navigation services offered by our competitors with greater resources and name recognition, such as Google and Apple. We have experienced and anticipate that we will continue to experience the non-renewal of our agreements for these services by our wireless carrier customers as demand from their subscribers declines. In the event our mobile navigation business ceases to be profitable we may ultimately elect to terminate our legacy wireless carrier mobile navigation business to the extent allowable under our contractual arrangements.
For our automotive manufacturer and tier one customers, we offer our connected car products and services for distribution with their vehicles and systems. We believe our history as a supplier of cloud-based navigation services combined with our proven track record of delivering navigation solutions to three of the top five global automobile manufacturers provides a unique advantage in the automotive navigation marketplace over our competitors. 
We offer four variations of our connected car products and services to our automobile manufacturer and tier one customers. First, we offer on-board navigation systems that are built into vehicles with all key elements of the system residing in the vehicle as a self-contained application along with the related software and content. Our on-board navigation products do not require access to the Internet or wireless networks to function. Second, we offer advanced navigation solutions that contain on-board functionality and also add cloud functionality such as cloud search, cloud routing, map updates and “live” data. We refer to these solutions as hybrid navigation. Third, we offer mobile phone-based navigation solutions that run on the phone and provide an interactive map and navigation instructions to the vehicle's video screen and audio system, which we refer to as brought-in navigation. Finally, we offer a Navigation Software Development Kit, or SDK, that enables our customers to add mapping and location capabilities to their cloud, mobile and on-board automotive applications.
We provide our connected car products and services directly to automobile manufacturers such as Ford Motor Company and affiliated entities, or Ford, which represented 55% of our revenue in fiscal 2018, General Motors Holdings and its affiliates, or GM, and Toyota Motor Corporation, or Toyota. We also provide our products and services indirectly through tier ones such as XEVO, Inc., or XEVO, for certain Toyota solutions; LG Electronics, Inc., or LG, for certain Opel solutions; and Panasonic Automotive Systems Company of America, or Panasonic, for certain Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, or FCA, solutions.

Our technology focuses on leveraging the complexity and scale associated with mobile location data to deliver better mobile campaigns for our advertising partners. We deliver mobile advertisements by leveraging our proprietary in-house ad serving technology. Our inventory, or accessible market, is comprised of thousands of mobile applications and mobile websites that are accessed through advertising exchanges using programmatic real-time bidding, or RTB, tools.
Automotive Navigation
Industry background
The automotive industry is going through a significant transformation due to the convergence of connectivity, autonomy, shared mobility and electrification, or CASE. In addition, due to high consumer expectations set by mobile phones, consumers are demanding user friendly products that are well integrated, always up-to-date and easy to use. Our market research has shown that in-vehicle infotainment is one of the features that drivers value most when purchasing a new car. 
We believe, and market studies by Strategy Analytics indicate, navigation has been and will continue to be one of the highest demanded features within in-vehicle infotainment systems. With the current CASE trends, navigation and the navigation platform will become increasingly important because the services used for in-vehicle infotainment either stem from or must work with the navigation system. Therefore, navigation will become integral to providing a seamless infotainment experience. For example, driver safety continues to be a key priority for government regulators and automobile manufacturers globally and the European New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) gives safety incentive points to vehicles with the Speed Assist Systems (SAS) features, some of which require mapping and navigation software. Due to these pressures, automobile manufacturers are adding navigation as a standard feature on more vehicles.
Navigation is an essential aspect of autonomous vehicles as mapping and navigation are required to localize the vehicle and guide it to its destination. For shared mobility, finding the nearest vehicle to a rider and routing the vehicle requires mapping and navigation. For electric vehicles, range planning, optimization of energy use and finding charging stations along the route are enabled by mapping and navigation. For these reasons navigation is becoming increasingly important and a key element of future vehicle infotainment and safety systems.
Industry challenges
The automotive industry is experiencing increasing pressures from new entrants such as Tesla and other industries, such as the mobile handset industry, that have fast innovation and execution, which enable them to capitalize on current trends. As a result, traditional automobile manufacturers are striving to keep up with consumer demands for new and updated content on the infotainment system, which previously was not capable of being updated without inconveniencing the consumer. According to Strategy Analytics, a leading automotive market research firm, customers consider on-board access to connected applications an important factor in determining their purchase decision. Consumers are strongly indicating their desire to access connected apps through their vehicle’s controls and displays. Automobile manufacturers that enhance the in-vehicle experience with cloud connectivity and improved infotainment capabilities can find greater acceptance from consumers, but the delivery of these capabilities is technically challenging and not a traditional part of the automobile manufacturer's capabilities or supply chain. This challenge is driving automobile manufacturers to seek new partners to create differentiated in-car experiences. Automobile manufacturers are also under pressure because of the recent introduction of brought-in platforms and products such as Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto along with other initiatives, including Open Automotive Alliance, which take control of the products and platforms away from the automobile manufacturers or tier one and could diminish brand loyalty to the automobile manufacturer. To counter this, automobile manufacturers are investing heavily in their infotainment solutions and leveraging their ability to provide better integration of the various automobile systems resulting in hybrid navigation services that are seamlessly integrated with in-vehicle displays (center screen, cluster, heads up display, rear-seat), speakers, voice recognition and vehicle sensors and therefore extremely easy to use. This integration of the infotainment also improves the safety of the driving experience by allowing drivers to "keep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road."
Our competitive strengths
Automobile manufacturers procure the various elements of each car that they manufacture from third party suppliers directly and through tier ones. We work directly with automobile manufacturers such as Ford, GM and Toyota, as well as through tier ones. Our strong track record as a provider of connected and personalized navigation services to mobile phones and our history of working with large wireless carriers has helped us develop skills and technology that are well suited to meet the 
2

demands faced by today's automobile manufacturers and tier ones. The sales cycle for automotive navigation systems is long, consultative and requires direct and continuous engagement with the automobile manufacturer and tier ones to succeed in securing business. Often the automobile manufacturer uses the sales process to help it define the ultimate product that it delivers to its end users in a way that not only enhances customer experience but also allows the automobile manufacturer to differentiate itself from the competition. We believe that our success with on-board, brought-in and hybrid navigation solutions at Ford, GM and Toyota, and the continuing shift in emphasis to connected services has demonstrated the strength of our offerings to other automobile manufacturers and tier ones. Through our ongoing collaboration with automobile manufacturers, we remain aligned with their goals and offer solutions that allow them to differentiate against other competitors, providing their users with a superior experience and, as a result, creating brand loyalty among their customers.
Our automotive products and services
We entered the automotive navigation services business in fiscal 2008, initially with Ford, and our first on-board navigation product was launched in Ford's model year 2010 vehicles. Since that time, we have been working with Ford and other automobile manufacturers and tier ones to deploy our various navigation products and services worldwide through on-board, brought-in and hybrid systems. 
Our primary automotive customer to date, Ford, currently distributes our on-board product as a standard or optional feature in certain of its models and locations. More recently, this solution has been enhanced with a phone-based connectivity feature providing key search capabilities. Our navigation products are now included in Ford models principally manufactured and sold in North America, South America, Europe and China, as well as distributed in models sold in Australia and New Zealand. In each geography where we provide navigation products to it, Ford also provides a map update program under which Ford owners in North America, South America, China and Europe with SYNC® 3 and in Australia and New Zealand with SYNC® 2 or SYNC 3 are eligible to receive annual map updates at no additional cost through the contractual period with the respective entity. 
In December 2017, we announced that Ford had chosen Telenav to provide its next generation navigation solution in North America, subject to certain conditions and execution of an agreement regarding those solutions. We were not awarded the contracts for Europe, South America and Australia and New Zealand. 
We have agreements with GM to provide our on-board and hybrid navigation solutions in its vehicles. Our navigation SDK powers GM's OnStar RemoteLink, and associated branded mobile applications, MyBuick, MyCadillac, MyChevrolet and MyGMC. GM also offers a localized version of our on-board, hybrid and mobile solutions for the Opel and Vauxhall brands in Europe. GM sold its Opel and Vauxhall brands to PSA Group in August 2017, and we continue to engage in development of similar solutions for Opel and Vauxhall. 
We were selected to provide entry level on-board navigation through LG, a tier one supplier for GM's select line of vehicles, for the European market. This solution launched in Opel's Adam, Corsa, Karl and Zafira model vehicles in 2017. These products are expected to be made available in select vehicles for model years 2019 to 2022. 
In February 2017, GM launched its first model featuring integration of our hybrid navigation solution in North America, the 2017 Cadillac CTS and CTS-V. Our solution is now available on the 2018 Cadillac CTS, CTS-V, ATS and XTS models, as well as select 2018 GM Terrain vehicles. GM also recently launched our hybrid navigation solution on model year 2019 truck and SUV/CUV models, including Chevy Silverado, GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Equinox. GM has launched vehicles with our hybrid navigation solution in China and the Middle East. Our hybrid navigation solution is scheduled to become available in additional regions and GM models for model years 2019 to model year 2025.
We have a partnership with Toyota for brought-in navigation services where our Scout GPS Link mobile application is enabled to connect with select Entune® Audio equipped Toyota vehicles and in select Lexus Enform® equipped Lexus models in the United States and Canada. Toyota and Lexus vehicles enabled to connect with our Scout GPS Link began shipping in August 2015 and September 2016, respectively. 
In January 2017, we and Xevo announced that Scout GPS Link and XevoTM Engine Link were chosen to provide brought-in navigation services, including a fully interactive moving map, for select Toyota vehicles equipped with Entune 3.0 Audio, as well as select Lexus vehicles equipped with Lexus Enform. Our fully interactive solution is available on select model year 2018 Toyota Camry and Sienna and Lexus NX and RC models, and was recently expanded to select model year 2019 Toyota Corolla hatchback, Avalon and CHR models. On these same Toyota and Lexus models, a premium embedded connected navigation option is also available that provides cloud-based search, powered by our navigation SDK. While we have seen expansion of our latest version of Scout GPS Link solution across more Toyota and Lexus models in fiscal 2019, we expect that Toyota may limit the number of future models or vehicles on which Scout GPS Link is offered by Toyota and Lexus due in part 
3

to the offering of alternative brought-in solutions such as Apple’s CarPlay, which Toyota recently announced it is offering across certain Toyota models, and the expanded offering of Google’s Android Auto solution across more automobile manufacturers.
In August 2017, Daimler AG, or Mercedes, selected Telenav’s enhanced OpenStreetMap, or OSM, platform and navigation SDK to power its Mercedes-Benz COMAND TOUCH® Rear Seat Entertainment system throughout the world. Our solution will provide mapping for rear seat entertainment.
In January 2018, we announced that our on-board navigation solution will be offered in select Jeep and Chrysler vehicles in the China market through Panasonic, a tier one supplier for FCA, in the FCA Uconnect system. Our embedded navigation is included in the 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Grand Commander and is expected to be included in Jeep Cherokee and Compass when those models debut in China later in the year.
Going forward, we anticipate more automobile manufacturers and tier ones will offer our hybrid navigation solutions with up-to-date data such as traffic, fuel prices, maps and points of interest, or POIs, to deliver an enhanced user experience. In addition, as the market transitions to cars that are “always connected,” we expect our product and service offerings to become more personalized, safer and seamlessly integrated with other functions in the infotainment system, resulting in a better overall user experience. 
Platform and architecture
Our automotive navigation product architecture is designed with flexibility in mind such that we may deliver custom solutions efficiently, to meet the unique requirements of automobile manufacturers and tier ones. We have created and continue to enhance our automotive reference product, or ARP, which will serve as the foundation for our custom solutions and also allow us to show automobile manufacturers our latest on-board, brought-in and hybrid navigation capabilities. In addition, we provide our cloud services via a standard application programming interface, or API, via our navigation SDK for those manufacturers seeking cloud services only, such as GM's mobile companion app. 
We have developed proprietary technologies to provide location-based on-board, brought-in and hybrid mapping and navigation services. Our on-board navigation products include a broad set of services including local search for addresses and business, converting addresses to latitude and longitude coordinates known as geocoding, routing, map rendering, traffic decoding and processing, multi-level map matching, map updates, navigation and guidance. We have also developed customized technology to improve the quality of speech recognition for address and POI searches.
Our cloud location-based services platform includes our engines for routing, mapping, local search, voice recognition, geo data aggregation, traffic, personalization, sensor processing, and a digital location-based advertising platform. We leverage our existing back-end cloud technologies for deployment to automobile manufacturer and tier one applications.
Our proprietary location-based services platform provides fast route and map generation while optimizing the route based on real-time traffic conditions. It also includes a local search technology so users can find addresses and POIs easily, to which users can then be routed. Because our proprietary platform uses computing resources efficiently, we are able to scale our servers economically for our automotive solutions.
Our back-end cloud services allow us to deliver up-to-date location based data and services to support our on-board navigation technologies. Our platform is designed to be content agnostic and offers the flexibility to use various data providers for maps, POIs, traffic and other location-based content services. This enables the automobile manufacturer or tier one to offer best of breed content, by region, to delight their drivers. It also allows more competitive content pricing by offering the automotive manufacturer or tier one the option of seeking bids from more than one content provider. We have expanded our navigation offering to add Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, or ADAS, capabilities. Our initial ADAS feature, called e-horizon, predicts the path of the user and extracts relevant map attributes to tell the vehicle about upcoming road characteristics such as curvature and elevation. This information may be used by the vehicle to alert the driver of unsafe conditions, actuate the car and also improve fuel economy.
In January 2014, we acquired skobbler GmbH, or skobbler, a leading provider of technologies that enhance the collection and use of OSM mapping data. By combining skobbler's technologies with other proprietary Telenav technologies, we have developed a range of OSM capabilities that allow us to use crowd sourced maps for more advanced services such as navigation. We deployed OSM as part of our Toyota Entune Audio Plus and Lexus Display Audio multimedia products. We believe that focusing our efforts on OSM will provide us with a competitive advantage and expand the nature and extent of our product offerings.

Advertising Platform
Industry background
Mobile advertising provides advertisers with many benefits over traditional advertising media and PC-based online advertising, such as anytime, anywhere access, personalization, location targeting and relevance. The development of the mobile advertising ecosystem has mirrored the development for online PC-based advertising. Advertising delivered to mobile devices has the potential to increase the impact and relevance of an ad to the user, because of the ability to identify the current location of the user and remember the user's prior locations. Location is a powerful indicator of an individual's interests and likely actions because it provides context about the user that is not available in traditional advertising. For example, an ad can be targeted to a consumer who is in close proximity to a retail store, or to a consumer who may live in an area that advertisers wish to target based on demographics or other characteristics. Given the benefits of mobile advertising as compared to traditional offline advertising and PC-based online advertising, we expect that marketers will continue to shift their advertising budgets to mobile as this market continues to grow. 
Industry challenges
The mobile advertising marketplace is a dynamic, fast growing industry with many new participants. Advertisers are transitioning significant portions of their marketing budgets to the mobile market where many of the traditional approaches to engaging customers are not effective. These advertisers need to be able to conduct ad campaigns that achieve favorable return on investment, or ROI. To measure ROI, advertisers typically include elements related to message reach, audience targeting capabilities and campaign effectiveness measurements.  Advertisers are particularly focused on measures of effectiveness for mobile ad campaigns, but the elements by which ROI of mobile ad campaigns are measured are evolving and not as well understood as traditional advertising campaigns. The mobile advertising market is comprised of application developers, advertising networks, advertising agencies, advertising exchanges and demand-side platforms, among others.  The various market participants tend to focus on specific elements of the market and each tries to deliver unique technology offerings to assist advertisers. Some focus on targeting, others on audience data and still others on the location information that makes the mobile marketplace distinct from all other advertising opportunities. Thinknear uses location data to build consumer insights, develop targeting tools, and create unique audiences that enable brands to connect with mobile consumers. While we are optimistic about the potential for in-vehicle advertising, we expect that it will take two to three years or longer before we start seeing any significant revenue from this channel.
Our competitive strengths 
Our location-based advertising solution combines large scale access to programmatic inventory, our ability to focus on particular audiences, and dynamic user content that is customizable based on location.
We have developed a number of techniques that allow us to differentiate between the effectiveness of ad impressions that include highly-accurate location data and those that do not. Our proprietary Location Score™ technology measures the accuracy of location information within advertising impressions in order to build audience segments that can be targeted for our customers. Our ability to effectively filter out inaccurate data is a key competitive advantage in the rapidly shifting mobile advertising space.
Because of our ability to identify real-time and historical location data, as well as our ability to ingest contextual targeting data, we can target our ads on specified demographics and advertiser-defined customer segments. For example, an ad delivered in a geographic area where it happens to be raining can provide a rain-related message. An ad for sunblock can be limited to areas with a high level of sunlight and ultraviolet radiation. In addition, it is our ability to do this at significant scale due to number of users and volume of data that allows advertisers to reach their target audience. We continue to believe that our location-based advertising business is a strategic component of our connected car roadmap, especially as it relates to potential new revenue streams from in-car ads.
Our services
Our advertising services are built around the ability to provide sophisticated location-based advertising in a manner that allows advertisers to connect with consumers on mobile devices. For example:
Creative - We run a wide range of creative ad units, including static, dynamic, mobile video and rich media content. Our creative allows national advertisers to easily “localize” their content without having to create thousands of individual campaigns. Our creative focuses on leveraging location data to incorporate local context such as distance to a store location, information on where to purchase a product or nearby events that could impact the potential consumer.
5

Targeting - We offer a variety of targeting tools to our advertising clients to improve the performance of the campaigns. Our targeting tools include both audience-focused tools centered on reaching specific customer segments and proximity-based tools focused on driving foot traffic to retail locations and other direct-response-related metrics.
Reports and metrics - We offer clients a broad range of reporting tools that allow them to monitor their advertising campaigns. The rich set of analytics and insights provided by our platform enable advertisers to understand in real time what is happening with respect to any of the campaigns being run by us. 
Platform and architecture
Our mobile advertising platform is hosted in the cloud, primarily by Amazon Web Services, or AWS. We leverage the flexibility and scalability of cloud service providers to meet our scale requirements. 
We have developed proprietary technologies that enable us to deliver location-based advertising across all types of mobile devices at scale. Our platform integrates location-enabled mobile advertising inventory with a number of contextual and location-based triggers to allow us to target mobile users. Our platform permits us to analyze, bid and deliver ad impressions through advertising exchanges in less than 30 milliseconds and to do so on billions of potential impressions every day. In addition, we are able to target our mobile campaigns based on a variety of criteria beyond location. Our platform was built to provide scalability through the use of machine-based decision processes, which allows us to execute thousands of campaigns, each with complex targeting criteria across multiple inventory sources.

Infrastructure and operations
Automotive Navigation
Our end users rely on our services primarily while on the road. As a result, we strive to ensure the continuous availability of our services through our high quality hosting platform and operational excellence.
Data center facilities. We developed our infrastructure with the goal of maximizing the availability of our applications, which are hosted on a highly scalable and available network located in AWS facilities in California, Oregon, Virginia, Germany, Ireland and South Korea. 
We entered into hosted service agreements with AWS for primary resource capacity and disaster recovery capacity. Pursuant to the service agreements, AWS provides leased facility space, power, cooling and Internet connectivity for a term of one year, and such agreements are subject to renewal.
We have similar arrangements with Alibaba Group Holding Limited’s cloud computing business unit, Alibaba Cloud, to provide hosting services for our location services in China.
Advertising platform
We developed our advertising platform infrastructure with the goal of maximizing the performance of our platform. Our platform is hosted on a highly scalable and available network provided by AWS. Our advertising platform has been designed to place significant focus on the location of any particular unit of display advertising made available for purchase on real time bidding ad exchanges. This focus on location provides us with the speed and capability to more rapidly bid on the inventory that we believe is best suited for our customers' advertising needs. Our use of AWS provides significant flexibility with respect to service capability to meet any peaks in demand from our advertisers.
Research and development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development and testing of our services and products. Our engineering team has deep expertise and experience in in-car embedded software, mobile software, location technologies and cloud services and we have a number of personnel with longstanding experience with location services applications and scaling hosted service models. In addition, through our acquisition of Thinknear and our own internal efforts, we have developed expertise in real time bidding and targeted advertising capabilities.

Our U.S., China and Romanian research and development operations function together to provide service and product development for our automotive customers. Our Romanian development efforts also focus on our OSM products. Our research and development expenses were $68.9 million, $73.1 million and $87.5 million for fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. 
Marketing and sales
Automotive Navigation
In connection with sales efforts directed at automobile manufacturers and tier ones, we employ a sales team that focuses on targeted customers and responds to requests for proposals and related sales opportunities.
The development and sales cycle for automotive navigation products and services is substantially longer than those associated with our advertising network services. The automotive sales cycle is consultative and requires direct and continuous engagement with the customer to succeed in securing a design win. A typical sales cycle is 12 to 18 months long. Often the automobile manufacturer uses the sales process to help it to define the ultimate product that it chooses to deliver to its end users. Generally, design wins for vehicles are awarded 24 to 36 months prior to the anticipated model year launch of the vehicle, as it takes this much time to develop and integrate the software and cloud services. Once we launch services with an automobile manufacturer, our application and services are typically bundled with vehicles for multiple years.
Advertising Platform
Marketing. We market our advertising services based upon our location and data expertise. We are building brand recognition and customer relationships based upon a consultative relationship with key advertising buyers, primarily advertising agencies and large brand marketers. 
Sales. We are engaged in direct sales efforts to expand the reach of our mobile advertising solutions. We strive to improve the efficiency and productivity of our sales force to help us grow the business to sustainable profitability.
Customers
We derive revenue primarily from automobile manufacturers and tier ones, and advertisers and advertising agencies. More specifically, we derive our revenue primarily from automobile manufacturers and tier ones whose vehicles contain our proprietary software and are able to access our navigation services. In addition, we have a strategic business in mobile advertising where our customers are primarily advertising agencies that represent national and regional brands, and channel partners that work closely with local and small business advertisers. To a lesser extent, we have legacy relationships with wireless carrier customers to provide mobile navigation services to their subscribers through mobile phones.
7

We generate revenue from automobile manufacturers and tier ones for delivery of customized software and royalties from the distribution of this customized software for on-board and hybrid automotive navigation solutions. In addition, we earn royalties from brought-in navigation services for vehicle applications powered by our location-based services platform. We typically enter into long term supply arrangements with our auto customers to provide our solutions across multiple car models in multiple regions around the world.
We also generate revenue from advertisers and advertising agencies for the delivery of advertising impressions based on the specific terms of the advertising contract. 
Our revenue from customers located in the United States comprised 97%, 88% and 94% of our total revenue for fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.
Ford
We are substantially dependent on Ford for our billings and revenue. In fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018, Ford represented 71%, 69% and 55% of our revenue, respectively, and 68%, 68% and 66% of billings, respectively. We expect Ford to represent a significant portion of our billings and revenue for the foreseeable future, with Ford's percentage of our revenue anticipated to increase with our adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, on July 1, 2018. 
We provide on-board navigation solutions to Ford pursuant to an agreement dated October 12, 2009. Our automotive products are now included in Ford models manufactured and sold in North America, Europe and China, as well as distributed in models sold in South America, Australia and New Zealand. On December 14, 2017, Ford awarded to Telenav a further extension of the agreement to December 31, 2020 for each jurisdiction in which we currently provide our products to Ford, subject to certain conditions and execution of a subsequent amendment to the agreement. The subsequent amendment was executed in March 2018. On December 14, 2017, Ford also selected us to provide its next generation navigation solution in North America, subject to certain conditions and execution of an agreement regarding those solutions. We were not awarded the contracts for Europe, South America and Australia and New Zealand. 
We are the preferred provider for on-board navigation integrated with Ford's SYNC 2 and SYNC 3 platforms during the term of the agreement. 
We have also entered into amendments with Ford such that Ford Europe and Ford Australia and New Zealand also provide a map update program under which Ford owners with SYNC 2, with respect to Australia and New Zealand only, or SYNC 3 in all geographies where we provide SYNC 3 products are eligible to receive annual map updates at no additional cost through the contractual period. 
In fiscal 2017, we also entered into amendments of our agreement with Ford pursuant to which Ford’s joint venture in China, Changan Ford Automobile Co., Ltd, became the primary contracting party for our relationship with Ford in that region.
Our agreement with Ford relating to navigation solutions integrated with Ford's SYNC 2 and SYNC 3 platforms allows for renewals for successive 12-month periods if either party provides notice of renewal at least 45 days prior to the expiration of the applicable term, and the other party agrees to such renewal. Our agreement with Ford also allows either party to terminate the agreement if the other party is insolvent or materially breaches its obligations and fails to cure such breach.
GM and LG 
We have an agreement with GM to provide our navigation services for GM's vehicles globally, which expires on December 31, 2025. Additionally, we have an agreement with LG to provide our on-board navigation solution to LG for select Opel vehicles for the European market. Such agreement expires June 30, 2022. Our agreements with GM, as well as our agreement with LG, allow either party to terminate the agreement if the other party is insolvent or breaches its obligations and fails to cure such breach, and permit GM, or LG as applicable, to terminate at its convenience.
Our hybrid navigation solutions are available on select model year 2018 GM vehicles in markets including North America, Australia and New Zealand, and in China with Shanghai-GM, or SGM. Our on-board navigation solutions are available on select model year 2018 Opel vehicles. We have also started offering our hybrid and on-board navigation solutions in select model year 2019 GM vehicles. Under our agreements with GM, we are obligated to provide our navigation products and services for additional models and regions through model year 2025.

Under our agreements with Ford and GM, we have obligations to indemnify each of them against, among other things, losses arising out of or in connection with any claim that our technology or services infringe third party proprietary or intellectual property rights. Our agreements with each of Ford and GM may be terminated in the event an infringement claim is made against us and it is reasonably determined that there is a possibility our technology or service infringed upon a third party's rights.
Safeguards against unauthorized data usage
We employ administrative, physical and technical safeguards as part of our efforts to prevent unauthorized collection, access, use and disclosure of our end users' private data and to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. We do not use any end user data for direct marketing or promotions without the consent of the user and do not store any user location information that personally identifies the end user except to deliver and support our services. We are also required to comply with our customers' privacy and data securities policies.
Intellectual property 
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving. Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services and products are available.
We seek to patent key concepts, components, protocols, processes and other inventions. As of June 30, 2018, we held 148 U.S. patents and 133 foreign patents expiring between April 11, 2020 and April 27, 2036, and have 61 U.S. and 34 foreign patent applications pending. Of the pending 61 U.S. patent applications, 60 are nonprovisional utility patent applications. These patents and patent applications may relate to features and functions of our services and the technology platforms we use to provide them. We have filed, and will continue to file, patent applications in the United States and other countries where there exists a strategic technological or business reason to do so. Any future patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Any patents that may issue in the future with respect to pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.
As of June 30, 2018, we owned the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office registered trademarks for Geocookie®, ONMYWAY®, Scout®, Sipity®, skobbler®, Telenav®, and Thinknear®, as well as the logos for Telenav, Scout and skobbler. We also own the Telenav registered trademark in Canada, China, the European Union, Mexico and the United Kingdom. We have several unregistered trademarks, including the marks Chatbaka™, Geobehavioral™, Geolink™, HopOver™, LivingMap™, Location Index ™, Location Score ™, MapStream™, OpenTerra™, RealReach™, RoadSense™, Scout GPS Link™, Situational Targeting™, Telenav GPS Navigator™, Telenav Navigator™, Telenav Scout™, Thinknear GeoVideo™, ThinkPolitical™, TrueDelta™, and TurnStream ™, as well as the Thinknear logo. 
We endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and with parties with which we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or that infringe our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on the success of our legal actions against these infringers, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.
We also enter into various types of licensing agreements to obtain access to technology or data that we utilize in connection with our navigation services. Our contracts with certain licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments, which are payable regardless of the ultimate volume of revenue derived from the number of paying end users. Our most important agreements are with the providers of maps pursuant to which we generally pay a monthly fee per end user or copy or a per transaction fee. We obtain map data from HERE North America, LLC, or HERE, pursuant to a master data license agreement dated December 1, 2002. HERE is principally owned by a consortium consisting of Audi AG, or Audi, BMW AG, or BMW, and Mercedes. Our agreement with HERE was automatically renewed under its existing terms through January 31, 2019, and automatically renews for successive one year periods unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the applicable term. In addition, we have entered into separate territory license agreements with HERE under which we are licensed to use certain map data for particular programs with certain of our current automotive customers to fulfill their requirements. The term of these territory licenses with HERE vary based on the customer and program, and can be extended for additional periods. Our agreement with HERE also allows a party to terminate the agreement if the other party materially breaches its obligations and fails to cure such breach.

In addition, we obtain other data such as map, weather updates, gas prices, POI and traffic information from additional providers.
Competition
The markets for development, distribution and sale of location services and advertising services are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, public relations, sales, distribution and other resources than we do.
We compete in the automotive navigation market with established automobile manufacturers and tier ones and providers of on-board navigation services such as AISIN AW CO., Ltd, or AISIN, AutoNavi Software Co., Ltd., or AutoNavi, Robert Bosch GmbH, or Bosch, Elektrobit Corporation, or Elektrobit, Garmin Ltd., or Garmin, HERE, Navinfo Co., Ltd., or Navinfo, NNG LLC, or NNG, Shenyang MXNavi Co., Ltd., or MXNavi, and TomTom North America, Inc., or TomTom, as well as other competitors such as Apple and Google.
We compete in the advertising services business with mobile platform providers, including Google, Facebook, Inc., or Facebook, Oath, Inc., or Oath, GroundTruth, Inc., or GroundTruth, Verve Wireless, Inc., or Verve Wireless, PlaceIQ, Inc., or PlaceIQ, and NinthDecimal, Inc., or NinthDecimal, among others. 
Competition in our markets is based primarily on pricing and performance including features, functions, reliability, flexibility, scalability and interoperability; automobile manufacturer, tier one and advertising agency relationships; technological expertise, capabilities and innovation; price of services and products and total cost of ownership; brand recognition; and size and financial stability of operations. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors based upon the performance, reliability and breadth of our services and products and our technical experience.
Some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, including with respect to the following:

• | significantly greater revenue and financial resources;


• | ownership of mapping and other content allowing them to offer a more vertically integrated solution;


• | stronger brand and consumer recognition in a particular market segment, geographic region or worldwide;


• | the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products;


• | access to core technology and intellectual property, including more extensive patent portfolios;


• | access to custom or proprietary content;


• | quicker pace of innovation;


• | stronger automobile manufacturer, tier one, advertising agency and advertiser relationships;


• | more financial flexibility and experience to make acquisitions;


• | lower labor and development costs; and


• | broader global distribution and presence.

Our competitors’ and potential competitors’ advantages over us could make it more difficult for us to sell our navigation services and advertising services, and could result in increased pricing pressures, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and failure to increase, or even the loss of, market share or expected market share, any of which would likely cause harm to our business, operating results and financial condition.
Employees
As of June 30, 2018, we employed 784 people, including 644 in research and development, 56 in sales and marketing, 27 in customer support, data center operations, and advertising operations, and 57 in a general and administrative capacity. As of that date, we had 271 employees in the United States, 256 in China, 236 in Romania, 13 in Germany, 6 in Korea and 2 in Japan. We also engage a number of temporary employees and consultants.
