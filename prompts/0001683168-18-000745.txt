ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
History
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 6, 2010 under the name “Advanced Ventures Corp.” Effective January 6, 2014, we changed our name to “Gold Union Inc.” Effective March 26, 2018, our name will be changed to Noble Vici Group, Inc. We expect our trading symbol to change to NVGI shortly thereafter.
 
In connection with our former business, we entered into an exclusive worldwide patent sale agreement (the “Patent Transfer and Sales Agreement”) with Ilanit Appelfeld (the “Seller”), to acquire a patented technology, U.S. Patent Number: 6,743,209 (the “Patent”), for a catheter with a integral anchoring mechanism on July 27, 2010. We acquired the patent and technology for $17,500 (seventeen thousand five hundred United States Dollars), according to the terms and conditions specified in the Patent Transfer and Sales Agreement related to U.S. Patent Number: 6,743,209.
 
During the second quarter of 2011 the Company raised gross proceeds of $75,000 pursuant to an effective Form S-1 Registration Statement and issued 37,500,000 post forward stock split shares of common stock that were registered pursuant to the Form S-1 Registration Statement.
 
Effective March 7, 2012, we increased the number of our authorized shares of common stock to three billion shares (3,000,000,000) and engaged in a forward stock split of its common shares whereby each one share of our common stock was split into fifteen shares of our common stock.
 
During the second fiscal quarter of 2014, we elected to discontinue our business of exploiting the Patent and began to consider other business opportunities that may bring quicker and greater value to our stockholders. We initially considered entering into the business of trading precious metal bullion primarily in the Asia Pacific region. Therefore, effective January 6, 2014, we changed our name to “Gold Union Inc.” to more adequately reflect our initial intended business operations.
 
On December 31, 2015, we consummated a Share Exchange Agreement with G.U. International Limited, a limited company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles and our wholly owned subsidiary (“GUI”), and Kao Wei-Chen, an individual representing herself and 8 other individuals (collectively, the “Golden Corridor Shareholders”), which agreement was amended several times to extend the closing date of the acquisition (collectively, the “Share Exchange Agreement”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we, through GUI, purchased 480 shares of Phnom Penh Golden Corridor Trading Co. Limited (the “GC Shares”), from 9 private Golden Corridor Shareholders, representing 48% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Golden Corridor. As consideration, we agreed to issue to the Golden Corridor Shareholders 2,500,000,000 shares of our common stock, at a value of US $0.002 per share, for an aggregate value of US $5,000,000.

Golden Corridor owns three parcels of land located at National Road 44, Phum Phkung, Chbarmorn Commune, Chbarmorn District, Kampong Speu Province, Kingdom of Cambodia, measuring an aggregate of 172,510 square meters (collectively, the “Properties”). Pursuant to an independent valuation conducted by a third party appraisal firm licensed under the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Cambodia and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Cambodia, the Properties have an estimated value of US $10,350,600 as of April 8, 2014. Golden Corridor intends to develop the Properties into an industrial park for rental income within the next two or three years. Golden Corridor has not yet commenced any significant operations.
 
As a result of our acquisition of the GC Shares, we elected to cease our metal bullion trading business and enter into the real estate development and rental business located in the Kingdom of Cambodia.
 
Due to difficulties in entering the real estate development and rental business, on February 2, 2018, we engaged in a corporate reorganization and effectively spun off our interest in Golden Corridor and our real estate business by distributing the GC Shares to our shareholders. On March 18, 2018, our subsidiary, G.U. Asia Limited was dissolved. As a result of the distribution, our current corporate structure is set forth below.
 

Gold Union Inc. (Delaware)
--------------------------


G.U. International Limited (Republic of Seychelles)
---------------------------------------------------

Description of Business
 
Prior to our distribution of the GC Shares, we had anticipated engaging in the business of purchasing, selling and leasing of land and houses, as well as making investments in industrial properties through our ownership of the GC Shares. As a result of our distribution, we are now a shell company with nominal assets.
 
Our current business plan is to seek business combination opportunities with existing businesses. The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company’s officers. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not entered into any agreement with any party regarding acquisition opportunities for us. We have unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we will consider the following kinds of factors:
 

· | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds from the Registrant, from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other relevant factors.

In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available acquisition opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the business to be acquired. In addition, we will be competing against other entities that possess greater financial, technical and managerial capabilities for identifying and completing business combinations. In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible given the lack of information that may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel and financial resources.
 
We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business’s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage. Our lack of funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or other associated with the target business seeking our participation.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us. 
 
Additionally, we are in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. We are, and will continue to be, an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with, joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private and public entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination.
 
Near-Term Requirements For Additional Capital 
 
For the immediate future, we intend to finance our business efforts and any future acquisitions through sales of our securities to existing shareholders and loans from existing shareholders or financial institutions. We have not yet generated revenues. We expect to incur relatively small operating losses over the next twelve months until we acquire an operating company. There can be no assurance that that we will be successful in consummating a business acquisition or that such business will be successful after acquisition.
Employees

We currently do not have any full time or part time employees. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Secretary, Lim Yew Chuan, is expected to carry out all administrative functions. Once we consummate a business acquisition, we expect to hire additional officers and employees for such operations.
 
We do not have any union employees.
