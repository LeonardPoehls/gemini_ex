Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

General
 
We are engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing and selling aerospace quality component parts for commercial and military aircraft, space vehicles, power plants and surface and undersea vessels.   Our initial products will be self-lubricating spherical bearings for commercial aircraft. These bearings are integral to the operation of commercial aircraft and help with several flight-critical tasks, including aircraft flight controls and landing gear. As of the date of this report, we have not had significant commercial manufacture and sale of our products.
 
We commenced our aircraft component business in February 1, 2010. To date, our operations have focused on the development of our production facility in Dongguan, China and the design and engineering of our initial product line of spherical bearings. Our production facility in Dongguan, China is held and operated by TPAC. Naval Air Systems Command (“NAVAIR”) of the United States Navy has completed the qualification testing of our initial line of bearings. Godfrey and TPAC received final approval from NAVAIR on March 5, 2013. However, we expect that we will need to raise at least $1 million of capital, or to develop a strategic partnership, through which the partner will contribute working capital, in order to better develop international marketing and production.
 
Our strategy is to leverage our product design and engineering expertise to form business relationships with local partners in markets outside the United States who will provide manufacturing, sales and distribution capabilities, similar to our relationship with Godfrey. Our initial target markets for establishing foreign partnerships are China, Australia, India and the Middle East.  We intend to partner in these foreign markets with local businesses that can establish in-country production facilities using our product design and engineering expertise, and thereby take advantage of economies available only to local producers. We intend to serve as the primary distributor of products manufactured by our foreign partners. In addition to our partners’ foreign based operations, we plan to establish our own manufacturing facility in the United States to provide component parts to U.S. military weapon systems and commercial aerospace end users.

We believe our strategy will permit us to compete more effectively with our larger competitors, who generally have greater financial resources, by:
 

· | Reducing our capital requirements by focusing on the design and engineering portions of the value chain;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Utilizing our partners' established raw material access, manufacturing facilities and sales and distribution networks;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Entering emerging international markets that have little in-country component parts manufacturing capacity and little established competition;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Taking advantage of local sales "offset" regulations that require aircraft original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Airbus and Boeing to procure and utilize local made components for incorporation into products sold; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Partnering with existing aerospace companies and investors within our initial target markets to provide us with working capital, political and economic resources and regional business and cultural expertise.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We currently have no joint venture in place for the manufacture or sale of our products other than our arrangements with Godfrey, but have supplier/distribution agreements with U.S., China, European and Australia related entities.
 
Recent Developments
 
Change of Control. On September 8, 2016, William McKay, our President and Chief Executive Officer gained control of the Company via issuance of the 10,000 shares of Series A preferred Stock issued to him. Following issuance of such shares, the Company had 3,920,880,936 shares of common stock and 14,421 shares of Series A preferred stock outstanding. Based on the current conversion price, each share of Series A preferred stock is entitled to 1 million votes per share. Accordingly, there were 18,341,880,936 votes outstanding voting together as a single class on September 8, 2016. The 10,000 shares of Series A preferred stock issued to Mr. McKay (along with the 300 shares of Series A preferred stock then held by him) provided him with approximately 56% of the total votes, resulting in change of control. The shares of Series A Preferred were issued to obtain voting control to make certain board decision at the best interest of the Company. The 10,000 shares are subsequently returned after October 31, 2016. Prior to the issuance of the control block of Series A Preferred, no singular person had control of the Company, although the Series A Preferred as a class accounted for 53% of the total votes outstanding prior to the issuance of the 10,000 shares to Mr. McKay. The 1,300 shares of Series B preferred stock issued to Mr. McKay on November 30, 2016 (pursuant to which he received an additional 1.3 trillion votes) increased his voting control over the Company to approximately 86% based on 4,268,880,936, 14,959 and 1,500 shares of Common Stock, Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock outstanding, respectively on such date (and thus 1,519,227,880,936 outstanding on such date). Each shares of Series B preferred stock is entitled to 100 million votes. On December 8, 2016, Mr. McKay cancelled and returned 10,000 shares of Series A preferred stock to treasury. However, he still retained approximately 86% of the outstanding voting control of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock, Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock voting together as a single class on such date.
 
Reincorporation as a Wyoming Corporation. Effective January 27, 2017, we completed a change of domicile (the “Reincorporation”) to Wyoming from Nevada by means of a merger of Trans-Pacific Aerospace Company Inc., a Nevada corporation with and into the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Trans-Pacific Aerospace Company, Inc., a Wyoming corporation. Following the Reincorporation, the affairs of the Company ceased to be governed by Nevada corporation laws pursuant to the Nevada Revised Statutes (“NRS”) and become subject to Wyoming corporation laws pursuant to the Wyoming Business Corporation Act (the “WBCA”). The Company’s governance is pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation filed in Wyoming and the Bylaws, reflecting, among other things, application of the WBCA. The resulting Wyoming corporation (TPAC-WY), is deemed to be same entity as the Company previously incorporated in Nevada (TPAC-NV), and there was no change in the Company’s business, management, employees, headquarters, benefit plans, assets, liabilities or net worth. Each of TPAC-NV’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock and of preferred stock automatically converted into an equivalent number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock of TPAC-WY, without any action on the part of our shareholders. The number of issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of TPAC-WY is identical to the Company’s capital stock existing immediately prior to the Reincorporation. The terms of the Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock of TPAC-WY is identical to the terms of the Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock of TPAC-NV.

Godfrey (China) Limited
 
Our initial operations have focused on the Chinese and U.S. bearings market and are conducted through TPAC. On March 30, 2010, we acquired 25% of the outstanding share capital of Godfrey in exchange for our contribution to Godfrey of technology used for the design and production of SAE-AS81820, 81934 and 81935 self-lubricated spherical bearings, bushings and rod-end bearings. These bearings and component parts are designed to meet the specifications and standards of NAVAIR and are widely used in the manufacture of commercial aircraft, among other products. In 2013 we acquired an additional 30% interest in Godfrey (China).
 
In September 2010, we opened our production facility in Guangzhou, China. As of the date of this report, TPAC and Godfrey have received qualification approval by NAVAIR. As of September, 2014, the Company was placed on the US Navy Qualified Producers List, allowing all Chinese and international airframe manufacturers, sub-tier suppliers, MRO facilities, airlines and distributors to purchase parts produced there.  The Company moved to a new facility in Dongguan, China in 2015 at a savings of approximately $60,000 annually. The Company, whose factory is located in close proximity to Hong Kong, was the first and remains the only company in China qualified for the production of SAE-AS81820 and 81934 spherical bearings and bushings.
 
Products
 
We are engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing and selling aerospace quality component parts for commercial and military aircraft, space vehicles, power plants and surface and undersea vessels.  Our product designs address over 3,000 component parts that are utilized in new and used commercial aircraft and military aircraft, space vehicles, power plants and surface and undersea vessels. Our initial products are self-lubricating spherical bearings for commercial aircraft. These bearings are integral to the operation of commercial aircraft and help with several flight-critical tasks, including aircraft flight controls and landing gear. We also intend to manufacture for sale bushings and rod-end bearings. We have received all regulatory approvals required for the manufacture and sale of our initial line of self-lubricating spherical bearings and bushings and intend to pursue regulatory approval of our initial line of rod-end bearings.
 
Spherical bearings facilitate proper power transmission from one plane surface to another, provide for articulation of mating parts and reduce friction. In general, a spherical bearing permits angular rotation about a central point in two orthogonal directions within a specified angular limit based on the bearing geometry. Typically, these bearings support a rotating shaft in the bore of the inner ring that must move not only rotationally, as most shafts, but also at angle. Spherical bearings permit freedom of rotation on the two axes that are not parallel with the shaft axis (although some bearings do permit this also). Comprised of one ball and one race, the ball is essentially a sphere with a hole bored through the center and the race is a ring that surrounds the ball. The ends of the sphere extend out past the surface of the race. These bearings are not used in rotational applications, but are used in misalignment applications or in hinging applications.
 
Spherical bearings act much like an elbow, wrist or knee joint acts in that they allow for slight rotation and severe misalignment. In aircraft, they are used on doors, hatches, landing gears, some flight control surfaces, slats, leading edges and trailing edges and on horizontal and vertical stabilizers. They are also used in engines as engine hangers and to open and close stator vanes.
 
Customers and Market
 
We plan to supply bearings for use in commercial, military and private aircraft, naval vessels, power plants, wind turbines and sophisticated commercial applications. Our potential customers include large aerospace companies such as Airbus, Boeing, Embraer, COMAC, General Electric, Rolls Royce, Pratt & Whitney, Honeywell and various aftermarket channels.
Manufacturing and Operations
 
We have commenced commercial manufacture of our products and are continuing to develop our commercial market. Our initial operations have focused on the Chinese and U.S. bearings markets and are conducted through Company facilities located in Dongguan, China.
 
As of the date of this report, TPAC and Godfrey have received qualification approval by NAVAIR of the United States Navy. In September 2014 the Company was placed on the US Navy Qualified Producers List, allowing all Chinese and international airframe manufacturers, sub-tier suppliers, MRO facilities, airlines and distributors to purchase parts produced by TPAC and Godfrey. The facility, located in close proximity to Hong Kong, is the first and only facility in China qualified for the production of SAE-AS81820 and 81934 spherical bearings and bushings. We anticipate providing NAVAIR with test samples for approval under SAE-AS81935 for the production of rod end bearings in 2016.

The production of our spherical bearings will occur in six general steps: (1) machining of ball and race; (2) preparation of self-lubricating liners; (3) assembly of race and liner; (4) swaging of ball in race; (5) final curing; and (6) final machining. These general steps take approximately 14 days to complete and employ a variety of tools, equipment and processes, some of which can be outsourced or performed at different facilities. For the foreseeable future, we expect that our production facilities and those of our partners will outsource the machining of the ball and race and the preparation of the liners. All other steps will be conducted at our production facilities or the facilities of our foreign partners. Our production facility in Dongguan, China is presently capable of conducting all production steps, other than the machining of the ball and race and final grinding of the bearings, at a capacity that will handle demand for the foreseeable future.
 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
We have commenced commercial sales of our products and are continuing to develop our commercial market.  Our current strategy is to form business relationships with local partners in markets outside the United States who will provide sales, marketing, and manufacturing capabilities. We will supply our product design and engineering expertise and also serve as the primary distributor of products manufactured by our joint venture partners. However, we expect that we will need to raise at least $1 million of capital, or to develop a strategic partnership, through which the partner will contribute working capital, in order to better develop international marketing and production
 
Our initial sales, marketing and distribution efforts focus on the self-lubricated spherical bearings, bushings and rod-ends manufactured at our production facility in Dongguan, China. We have received all regulatory approvals required for the manufacture and sale of our initial line of self-lubricating spherical bearings and bushings and intend to pursue regulatory approval of our initial line of rod-end bearings.
 
We expect to supplement the sales activities of our local-market partners with direct sales efforts by our executive management and internal sales staff. During the first quarter of 2014, we signed a marketing and sales agreement with a Hong Kong aerospace marketing company with strong marketing and distribution ties to the Chinese market. During the third quarter of 2015, we signed a marketing and sales agreement with a Hong Kong aerospace marketing company with strong marketing and distribution ties to the Australian, Indian and Middle East markets. During the first quarter of 2016 we received approval and became a supplier to a U.S. based, China owned aerospace distributor, for the marketing and distribution of our products. We intend to implement a strategic brand management initiative that will seek to position the Trans-Pacific name as a global brand with local roots in various foreign countries.  In addition to standard primary touch points including OEMs, airlines and MROs, we will also reach out to leading bearing distributors, the sub-assembly industry and others. We do expect to market to the U.S. military. Our marketing elements will include:
 

· | Participation in major air and aerospace trade shows (e.g., China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition; Farnborough/Paris; Dubai; Singapore; Zhuhai);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Participation in trade fairs (for airlines and MROs) sponsored by Boeing, Airbus and Embraer;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Trade publicity;
--+-----------------


· | Key market tours to coincide with government-sponsored expositions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sponsorship of “best practice” seminars for airlines and MROs; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sales support materials for distributors (promotional collateral and product DVDs).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
The markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide. Due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry, competition in these categories comes from both U.S. and foreign companies. Competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations that have significantly greater financial, technological and marketing resources than we do, to small privately-held entities, with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios.
 
The largest competitors in the sale of spherical bearings for the commercial aircraft industry are Minebea Co. Ltd., an international manufacturer of bearing products headquartered in Tokyo, Japan and traded on the Nikkei Stock Exchange, and RBC Bearings, Inc., an international manufacturer of bearing products headquartered in Oxford, Connecticut and traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market.

We expect to compete on the basis of engineering, manufacturing and marketing high quality products which meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers, consistent and timely delivery, and superior customer service and support. Additionally, we plan to take advantage of established long term relationships and sales "offset" regulations (in China and our other target markets) that require aircraft OEMs such as Airbus and Boeing to procure and utilize local made components for incorporation into products sold.
 
Regulations and Laws
 
The commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by the OEMs, including Boeing and Airbus, and both the Federal Aviation Administration, or the FAA, in the United States and by the Joint Aviation Authorities in Europe and other agencies throughout the world. We, and the components we manufacture, are required to be certified or approved by one or more of these agencies and/or, in many cases, by individual OEMs in order to sell our parts for use in commercial aircraft. Our foreign sales may be subject to similar approvals or U.S. export control restrictions, however, our management believes that there are no currently existing export restrictions for the products we wish to sell.
 
In order to sell component parts to the OEMs of commercial aircraft in the United States, our products must be approved by an OEM or government agency, such as NAVAIR. These production approval holders provide quality control and performance criteria and oversight and, in effect, generally limit the number of suppliers directly servicing the commercial aerospace new parts market. In order to directly sell component parts to the aftermarket, we must conform to a separate set of FAA regulations providing for an independent parts manufacturing authority, or PMA, process, which enables suppliers who conform to FAA PMA requirements to sell products to the aftermarket, irrespective of whether the supplier is an approved supplier to the OEM for original equipment or products. Currently, we are approved by NAVAIR and are an approved supplier to Boeing Commercial Aircraft Company. We are working toward Boeing Supplier Qualification Approval, which would greatly enhance the opportunity to quote on products from Boeing.
 
As of the date of this report, TPAC and Godfrey have received qualification approval by NAVAIR. As of September, 2014 the Company was placed on the US Navy Qualified Producers List, allowing all Chinese and international airframe manufacturers, sub-tier suppliers, MRO facilities, airlines and distributors to purchase parts produced there. The Dongguan facility, located in close proximity to Hong Kong, is the first and only facility in China qualified for the production of SAE-AS81820 and 81934 spherical bearings and bushings. We anticipate providing NAVAIR with test samples for approval under SAE-AS81935 for the production of rod end bearings during 2017. Our spherical bearings are now eligible for sale to OEMs in the U.S. Since the PMA process is unavailable to manufacturers in China, products produced at our facilities in China will not be entitled to be sold in the U.S. aftermarket directly by our Chinese manufacturing company. However, because TPAC is located in the USA, we are able to utilize our facility in the United States in order to sell to the aftermarket the parts manufactured by our facilities in China.
 
In addition, sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by non-U.S. entities are subject to compliance with U.S. export control laws. Our management believes that none of the products we intend to design or manufacture currently are listed as restricted commodities on the U.S. Commerce Control List and that none of the products nor the technology to manufacture the products currently are subject to export license requirements from any agency of the United States federal government.
 
Our operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws. Our manufacturing facility in China is in compliance with all state and local laws.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Because we have few proprietary rights, others can provide products substantially equivalent to ours. We hold no patents. Although we have developed designs and processes for our line of spherical bearing products, we believe that most of the technology used by us in the design of our products is generally known and available to others. Consequently, others can develop spherical bearing products similar to ours. We rely on a combination of confidentiality agreements and trade secret law to protect our confidential information. In addition, we restrict access to confidential information on a ‘‘need to know’’ basis. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information. If our proprietary rights are violated, or if a third-party claims that we violate their proprietary rights, we may be required to engage in litigation. Proprietary rights litigation tends to be costly and time consuming. Bringing or defending claims related to our proprietary rights may require us to redirect our human and monetary resources to address those claims.

Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the storage, handling and disposal of wastes and the health and safety of employees. We also may be liable under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act or similar state laws for the costs of investigation and clean-up of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us, or at other facilities at which we have disposed of hazardous substances. In connection with such contamination, we may also be liable for natural resource damages, government penalties and claims by third parties for personal injury and property damage. Agencies responsible for enforcing these laws have authority to impose significant civil or criminal penalties for noncompliance. We believe we are currently in material compliance with all applicable requirements of environmental laws. We do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental compliance in fiscal 2016. Our operations in the U.S. do not involve any manufacturing or production and do not generate any hazardous waste.
Employees
 
As of the date of this report, we have six employees, including two employees of our China facility. We expect to add additional employees subject to our commencement of manufacturing operations.
