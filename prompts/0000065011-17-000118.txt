ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
Meredith Corporation has been committed to service journalism for 115 years. Meredith began in 1902 as an agricultural publisher. In 1924, the Company published the first issue of Better Homes & Gardens. The Company entered the television broadcasting business in 1948. Today, Meredith uses multiple media platforms—including broadcast television, print, digital, mobile, and video—to provide consumers with content they desire and to deliver the messages of our advertising and marketing partners. The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Iowa. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MDP.
The Company operates two business segments: local media and national media. Our local media segment consists of 17 television stations located across the United States (U.S.) concentrated in fast growing markets with related digital and mobile media assets. The television stations include seven CBS affiliates, five FOX affiliates, two MyNetworkTV affiliates, one NBC affiliate, one ABC affiliate, and two independent stations. Local media's digital presence includes 12 websites, 12 mobile-optimized websites, and approximately 30 applications (apps) focused on news, sports, and weather-related information.
Our national media segment includes leading national consumer media brands delivered via multiple media platforms including print magazines and digital and mobile media, brand licensing activities, database-related activities, and business-to-business marketing products and services. It focuses on the food, home, parenting, and lifestyle markets and is a leading publisher of magazines serving women. In fiscal 2017, we published in print more than 20 subscription magazines, including Better Homes & Gardens, Shape, Parents, Family Circle, Martha Stewart Living, Rachael Ray Every Day, FamilyFun, and Allrecipes, and nearly 140 special interest publications. Most of our brands are also available as digital editions on one or more of the major digital newsstands and on major tablet devices. The national media segment's extensive digital presence consists of more than 50 websites, nearly 50 mobile-optimized websites, and nearly 20 apps. The national media segment also includes digital and customer relationship marketing, which provides specialized marketing products and services to some of America's leading companies; a large consumer database; brand licensing activities; and other related operations.
Financial information about industry segments can be found in Item 7-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Note 15.
The Company's largest revenue source is advertising. National and local economic conditions affect the magnitude of our advertising revenues. Both local media and national media revenues and operating results can be affected by changes in the demand for advertising and consumer demand for our products. Television advertising is seasonal and cyclical to some extent, traditionally generating higher revenues in the second and fourth fiscal quarters and during key political contests and major sporting events. Magazine circulation revenues are generally affected by national and regional economic conditions and competition from other forms of media.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS
During fiscal 2017, Meredith renewed its licensing program with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Walmart). This program features more than 3,000 SKUs of Better Homes & Gardens branded products at 5,000 Walmart stores and on walmart.com. In addition, in September 2016, EatingWell-branded frozen entrées were launched through a variety of regional and national grocers. Due to the strong consumer demand for these products, additional distribution will be added in the second half of calendar 2017.
During fiscal 2017, Meredith continued to expand our reach to the consumer through magazine brand launches. In July 2016, Meredith announced a partnership with Joanna and Chip Gaines, owners of the successful Magnolia brand, to launch the Magnolia Journal, a quarterly lifestyle magazine. Due to strong demand, two weeks after its newsstand debut in October 2016, Meredith went back to press to increase the distribution from 400 thousand to 600 thousand. The title quickly became Meredith's strongest-selling launch in recent history, and is on track to become the most profitable title in the first year of operation in Meredith history. The title is now selling more than 900,000 copies each issue through both paid subscriptions and at newsstand. In addition to the Magnolia Journal launch, Meredith released a bookazine based on the House & Garden brand and a newsstand magazine based on the Forks Over Knives brand.
In fiscal 2017, Meredith debuted redesigns of our two largest subscription magazines. The September 2016 issue of Family Circle introduced a new logo with refreshed layouts, fonts, and bolder photography. This redesign allows easier navigation with more entry points, quick takeaways, and engaging story formats. The January 2017 issue of Better Homes & Gardens revealed a new logo. The new logo provides equal balance to both components and creates a cohesive brand identity across multiple platforms.
In April 2017, Meredith acquired WPCH-TV (Peachtree TV), an independent station in Atlanta, Georgia. Prior to its acquisition, Meredith had managed the day-to-day operations of Peachtree TV, including advertising sales, marketing and promotions, and technical operations. This acquisition created Meredith's fifth owned-and-operated duopoly market, as Meredith also owns WGCL, the CBS affiliate in Atlanta.
In May 2017, Meredith, in partnership with Andrews McMeel Universal, launched the Posh Coloring Studio, the first on-demand, all-access, coloring club for adults. The Posh Coloring Studio is a membership program that provides members with continuously added designs from top coloring creators, exclusive editorial features, and social community connection with other Posh Coloring Studio members.

1 Designated Market Area (DMA) is a registered trademark of, and is defined by, Nielsen Media Research. The national rank is from the 2016-2017 DMA ranking. 
2 Average audience share represents the estimated percentage of households using television tuned to the station in the DMA. The percentages shown reflect the average total day shares (6:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.) for the November 2016, February 2017, and May 2017 measurement periods. 

Operations
The principal sources of the local media segment's revenues are: 1) local non-political advertising focusing on the immediate geographic area of the stations; 2) retransmission of our television signals by cable, satellite, and telecommunications service providers; 3) national non-political advertising; 4) political advertising which is cyclical with peaks occurring in our odd fiscal years (e.g., fiscal 2015, fiscal 2017) and particularly in our second fiscal quarter of those fiscal years; and 5) digital advertising on the stations' websites, mobile-optimized websites, and apps.
The stations sell commercial time to both local/regional and national advertisers. Rates for spot advertising are influenced primarily by the market size, number of media competitors, including in-market broadcasters, and audience ratings and demographics. The larger a station's audience in any particular daypart, the more leverage a station has in negotiating advertising rates. Generally, as supply and demand fluctuate in the market, so do a station's advertising rates. Most national advertising is sold by an independent representative firm. The sales staff at each station generates local/regional advertising revenues.
Typically 40 to 50 percent of a market's television advertising revenue is generated during local newscasts. Stations are continually working to grow their news ratings, which in turn increase advertising revenues.
Meredith's 16 national network affiliations at our television stations also influence advertising rates. Generally, a network affiliation agreement provides a station the exclusive right to broadcast network programming in its local service area. In return, the network has the right to sell most of the commercial advertising aired during network programs.
Programming fees paid to the networks are in essence a portion of the retransmission consent fees that Meredith receives from cable, satellite, and telecommunications service providers, which pay Meredith to carry our television programming in our markets. In addition to increases in fiscal 2016, programming fees paid to the networks increased significantly in fiscal 2017.

Stations generally also pay networks for certain programming and services such as marquee sports (professional football, college basketball, and Olympics) and news services. Most of the Company's FOX affiliates also pay the FOX network for additional advertising spots during prime-time programming. While Meredith's relations with the networks historically have been very good, the Company can make no assurances they will remain so over time.
Retransmission consent revenue is generated from cable, satellite, and telecommunications service providers who pay Meredith for access to our television station signals so that they may retransmit our signals and charge their subscribers for this programming. These fees increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to renegotiations of expiring contracts and negotiated contract step-ups on existing contracts effective during the year.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has permitted broadcast television station licensees to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services such as high-definition television programming, audio, data, mobile applications, and other types of communication, subject to the requirement that each broadcaster provide at least one free video channel equal in quality to the current technical standards. Several of our stations are broadcasting one or more additional programming streams on their digital channel. Examples include: two of our markets have MyNetworkTV, three air the LAFF network, eight carry COZI TV network, and six broadcast Escape network.
The costs of television programming are significant. In addition to network affiliation fees, there are two principal programming costs for Meredith: locally produced programming, including local news, and purchased syndicated programming. The Company continues to increase our locally produced news and entertainment programming to control content and costs and to attract advertisers. Syndicated programming costs are based largely on demand from stations in the market and can fluctuate significantly.
Competition
Meredith's television stations compete directly for advertising dollars and programming in their respective markets with other local television stations, radio stations, cable television providers, and competitors' websites and mobile-optimized websites. Other mass media providers such as newspapers and their related websites and apps, are also competitors. Advertisers compare market share, audience demographics, and advertising rates, and take into account audience acceptance of a station's programming, whether local, network, or syndicated.
Regulation
The ownership, operation, and sale of broadcast television stations, including those licensed to the Company, are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which engages in extensive regulation of the broadcasting industry under authority granted by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act), including authority to promulgate rules and regulations governing broadcasting. The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest. Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands; determines stations' locations and operating parameters; issues, renews, revokes, and modifies station licenses; regulates and limits changes in ownership or control of station licenses; regulates equipment used by stations; regulates station employment practices; regulates certain program content, including commercial matters in children's programming; has the authority to impose penalties for violations of its rules or the Communications Act; and imposes annual fees on stations. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, as well as to the FCC's rules, public notices, and rulings for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations.
Broadcast licenses are granted for eight-year periods. The Communications Act directs the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the station has served the public interest and is in substantial compliance with the provisions of the Communications Act and FCC rules and policies. Management believes the Company is in substantial compliance with all applicable provisions of the Communications Act and FCC rules and policies and knows of no reason why Meredith's broadcast station licenses will not be renewed.
The FCC has, on occasion, changed the rules related to ownership of media assets, including rules relating to the ownership of one or more television stations in a market. The FCC's media ownership rules are subject to further review by the FCC, various court appeals, petitions for reconsideration before the FCC, and possible actions by Congress. We cannot predict the impact of any of these developments on our business.

The Communications Act and the FCC also regulate relationships between television broadcasters and cable, satellite, and telecommunications television providers. Under these provisions, most cable systems must devote a specified portion of their channel capacity to the carriage of the signals of local television stations that elect to exercise this right to mandatory carriage. Alternatively, television stations may elect to restrict cable systems from carrying their signals without their written permission, referred to as retransmission consent. Congress and the FCC have established and implemented generally similar market-specific requirements for mandatory carriage of local television stations by satellite television providers when those providers choose to provide a market's local television signals. These rules, including related rules on exclusivity, good faith bargaining, and "over-the-top" carriage are subject to further review by the FCC and possible actions by Congress. We cannot predict the impact of any of these developments on our business.
The FCC proposed a plan, called the National Broadband Plan, to increase the amount of spectrum available in the U.S. for wireless broadband use. In furtherance of the National Broadband Plan, Congress enacted, and the President signed into law, legislation authorizing the FCC to conduct a “reverse auction” for which television broadcast licensees could submit bids to receive compensation in return for relinquishing all or a portion of their rights in the television spectrum of their full service and/or Class A stations. Under the new law, the FCC may hold one reverse auction and a follow-up auction for the newly freed spectrum. The FCC completed both auctions earlier in calendar 2017.
Even if a television licensee did not participate in the reverse auction, the results of the auction could materially impact a station's operations. The FCC has the authority to force a television station to change channels and/or modify its coverage area to allow the FCC to rededicate certain channels within the television band for wireless broadband use. Earlier this calendar year, the FCC released a list of television stations that must change their facilities as part of this "repacking" process. Several of our stations are among the hundreds of stations selected for repacking of the television band. The repacking process will be ongoing for several years and may change. The FCC will reimburse us for certain repacking expenses subject to an overall $1.75 billion industry cap on the reimbursed expenses of all repacked television stations. We cannot predict whether or how this process will ultimately affect the Company or our television stations.
In addition to the National Broadband Plan, Congress, and the FCC have under consideration, and in the future may adopt, new laws, regulations, and policies regarding a wide variety of other matters that also could affect, directly or indirectly, the operation, ownership transferability, and profitability of the Company's broadcast stations and affect the ability of the Company to acquire additional stations. In addition to the matters noted above, these could include spectrum usage fees, regulation of political advertising rates, restrictions on the advertising of certain products (such as alcoholic beverages), program content restrictions, and ownership rule changes.
Other matters that could potentially affect the Company's broadcast properties include technological innovations and developments generally affecting competition in the mass communications industry for viewers or advertisers, such as home video recording devices and players, satellite radio and television services, cable television systems, newspapers, outdoor advertising, and internet-delivered video programming services. For example, the FCC is currently considering a proposal to allow the voluntary transition of television broadcasters to ATSC 3.0, known as Next Generation Television. We cannot predict whether or how this process will ultimately affect the Company or our television stations.
The information provided in this section is not intended to be inclusive of all regulatory provisions currently in effect. Statutory provisions and FCC regulations are subject to change, and any such changes could affect future operations and profitability of the Company's local media segment. Management cannot predict what regulations or legislation may be adopted, nor can management estimate the effect any such changes would have on the Company's television broadcasting operations.

National Media
National media contributed 63 percent of Meredith's consolidated revenues and 41 percent of the combined operating profit from local media and national media operations in fiscal 2017. Better Homes & Gardens, our flagship brand, continues to account for a significant percentage of revenues and operating profit of the national media segment and the Company.

1 | Rate base is the circulation guaranteed to advertisers. Actual circulation generally exceeds rate base and for most of the Company's titles is tracked by the Alliance for Audited Media, which issues periodic statements for audited magazines.

In addition to these major magazine titles, we published nearly 140 special interest publications under approximately 90 titles in fiscal 2017, primarily under the Better Homes & Gardens brand. The titles are issued from one to six times annually and sold primarily on newsstands. A limited number of subscriptions are also sold to certain special interest publications. The following special interest titles were published quarterly or more frequently: American Patchwork & Quilting; Country Gardens; Diabetic Living; Do It Yourself; Eat This, Not That!; The Magnolia Journal; and Quilts & More.
Magazine Advertising—Advertising revenues are generated primarily from sales to clients engaged in consumer marketing. Many of Meredith's larger magazines offer regional and demographic editions that contain similar editorial content but allow advertisers to customize messages to specific markets or audiences. The Company sells two primary types of magazine advertising: display and direct-response. Advertisements are either run-of-press (printed along with the editorial portions of the magazine) or inserts (preprinted pages). Most of the national media segment's advertising revenues are derived from run-of-press display advertising. Meredith also possesses strategic marketing capabilities, which provide clients and their agencies with access to all of Meredith’s media platforms and capabilities, including print, television, digital, video, mobile, consumer events, and custom marketing. Our team of creative and marketing experts delivers innovative solutions across multiple media channels that meet each client's unique advertising and promotional requirements.
Magazine Circulation—Subscriptions obtained through direct-mail solicitation, agencies, insert cards, the internet, and other means are Meredith's largest source of circulation revenues. Revenue per subscription and related expenses can vary significantly by source. Some subscription sources generate lower revenues than other sources, 
 7

but have proportionately lower related costs. The majority of subscription magazines are also sold by single copy. Single copies sold on newsstands are distributed primarily through magazine wholesalers, who have the right to receive credit from the Company for magazines returned to them by retailers.
Digital and Mobile Media
We have 21 of our titles available as digital editions, with an audience of approximately 1.2 million. Digital subscriptions and single copy sales collectively represent 4 percent of our total rate base.
National media's more than 50 websites and nearly 50 mobile-optimized websites provide ideas and inspiration. These branded websites focus on the topics that women care about most—food, home, entertaining, and meeting the needs of moms—and on delivering powerful content geared toward lifestyle topics such as health, beauty, style, and wellness. Our Allrecipes brand alone accounts for 19 web and mobile sites serving 24 countries in 12 languages, one app across multiple platforms, and one Skill for Amazon Alexa. Digital traffic across our various platforms averaged 77 million unique monthly visitors in fiscal 2017. Our brands have a strong social networking presence as well. In fiscal 2017, national media reached over 30 million Facebook fans, nearly 13 million Twitter followers, about 5 million Instagram followers, and nearly 6 million Pinterest followers.
Other Sources of Revenues
Other revenues are derived from digital and customer relationship marketing, other custom publishing projects, brand licensing agreements, and ancillary products and services.
Meredith Xcelerated Marketing—Meredith Xcelerated Marketing (MXM) is a strategic and creative agency with digital expertise across multiple channels. MXM provides fully-integrated marketing solutions for some of the world's top brands, including The Kraft Heinz Co., Benjamin Moore, Allergan, TGIFridays, and WebMD. MXM's revenue is independent of advertising and circulation, though sometimes its services are sold as part of larger programs that include advertising components.
Brand Licensing—Meredith owns a portfolio of valuable registered trademarks. Meredith brand licensing generates royalty revenue through multiple long-term licensing agreements with retailers, manufacturers, and service providers benefiting through the use of those trademarks. Brand licensing extends the reach of Meredith brands into additional consumer channels in the U.S. and abroad.
For almost 10 years, Meredith has had a direct-to-retail licensing agreement with Walmart for Better Homes & Gardens-branded products sold at Walmart stores in the U.S., Walmart.com, and emerging in stores in Mexico and China. We recently extended our licensing agreement with Walmart through 2019. Meredith also has a long-term agreement to license the Better Homes & Gardens brand to Realogy Corporation, which continues to build a residential real estate franchise system as Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate, LLC. The network now includes more than 300 offices and more than 11,000 agents across the U.S., Canada, and the Bahamas. Other licensing agreements include Better Homes & Gardens floral arrangements with FTD.com and SHAPE Active, an activewear collection designed for women.
During fiscal 2017, the EatingWell branded line of healthy frozen food entrées manufactured and distributed by Bellisio Foods Inc. launched across a variety of regional and national grocers. Due to strong consumer response, these "Better For You" entrées are expected to continue to gain retail distribution in the second-half of calendar 2017. 
Meredith's national media brands are currently distributed in nearly 80 countries, including a localized presence in more than 30 countries such as Australia, China, India, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey in print and digitally.
The Company continues to pursue activities that will serve consumers and advertisers while also extending and strengthening the reach and vitality of our brands.

Meredith has licensed exclusive global rights to publish and distribute books based on our consumer-leading brands, including the powerful Better Homes & Gardens imprint, to a book publisher. Meredith creates book content and retains all approval and content rights while the publisher is responsible for book layout and design, printing, sales and marketing, distribution, and inventory management. Meredith receives royalties based on sales subject to a guaranteed minimum.
Production and Delivery
Paper, printing, and postage costs accounted for 27 percent of the national media segment's fiscal 2017 operating expenses.
Coated publication paper is the major raw material essential to the national media segment. We directly purchase all of the paper for our magazine production and custom publishing business. The Company has contractual agreements with major paper manufacturers to ensure adequate supplies for planned publishing requirements. The price of paper is driven by overall market conditions and is therefore difficult to predict. In fiscal 2017, average paper prices decreased 5 percent. They declined 2 percent in fiscal 2016 and 3 percent in fiscal 2015. Management anticipates paper prices will be stable during fiscal 2018 and that fiscal 2018 average paper prices will be relatively flat compared to fiscal 2017 given no significant shifts in the current supply and demand structure are anticipated.
Meredith has multi-year printing contracts with two major domestic printers for the printing of our magazines.
Postage is a significant expense of the national media segment. We continually seek the most economical and effective methods for mail delivery, including cost-saving strategies that leverage work-sharing opportunities offered within the postal rate structure. Periodical postage accounts for over 80 percent of Meredith's postage costs, while other mail items—direct mail, replies, and bills—account for nearly 20 percent. The Governors of the United States Postal Service (USPS) review prices for mailing services annually and adjust postage rates periodically. In general, postage rate changes are capped by law at the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index. The most recent rate change was an increase of less than one percent effective January 2017. With the exception of fiscal 2016, postage prices have risen in each of Meredith's last five fiscal years. In fiscal 2016, we saw a rare reduction in postage prices due to a roll-back of the temporary 4.3 percent exigent increase implemented in January 2014. While we expect postage prices to again increase in January 2018, a legislatively mandated calendar 2017 review of the existing law by the Postal Regulatory Commission could potentially result in adjustments to the current rate setting regime. The impact of any such change could be effective as early as the first quarter of calendar 2018. Meredith continues to work independently and with others to encourage and help the USPS find and implement efficiencies to contain rate increases. We cannot, however, predict future changes in the postal rates or the impact they will have on our national media business.
Subscription fulfillment services for Meredith's national media segment are provided by third parties. National magazine newsstand distribution services are also provided by third parties through multi-year agreements.
Competition
Publishing is a highly competitive business. The Company's magazines and related publishing products and services compete with other mass media, including the internet and many other leisure-time activities. Competition for advertising dollars is based primarily on advertising rates, circulation levels, reader demographics, advertiser results, and sales team effectiveness. Competition for readers is based principally on editorial content, marketing skills, price, and customer service. While competition is strong for established titles, gaining readership for newer magazines and specialty publications is especially competitive.

EMPLOYEES
As of June 30, 2017, the Company had approximately 3,500 full-time and 120 part-time employees. Only a small percentage of our workforce is unionized. We consider relations with our employees to be good.
OTHER
Name recognition and the public image of the Company's trademarks (e.g., Better Homes & Gardens and Parents) and television station call letters are vital to the success of our ongoing operations and to the introduction of new businesses. The Company protects our brands by aggressively defending our trademarks and call letters.
The Company had no material expenses for research and development during the past three fiscal years. Revenues from individual customers and revenues, operating profits, and identifiable assets of foreign operations were not significant. Compliance with federal, state, and local provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and to the protection of the environment had no material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or the Company's competitive position.

We have tried, where possible, to identify such statements by using words such as believe, expect, intend, estimate, may, anticipate, will, likely, project, plan, and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Any forward-looking statements are and will be based upon our then-current expectations, estimates, and assumptions regarding future events and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements that are part of this filing; actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
