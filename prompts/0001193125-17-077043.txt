Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Our Company 
 We are a leading national producer and distributor of value-added, convenient, ready-to-eat sandwiches, sandwich components and other entrées and snacks. We hold the number one or number two market share position by sales or volume in nearly all our major product categories, with net sales of $1.6 billion in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (Fiscal 2016) and the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016 (Fiscal 2015). We offer a differentiated value proposition to our customers due to our scale, broad product portfolio, customization capabilities, national distribution and food safety track record. 
 We market and distribute approximately 2,900 stock keeping units (SKUs) across all day parts in multiple product categories, including: (1) ready-to-eat sandwiches (such as breakfast sandwiches, peanut butter and jelly (PB&J) sandwiches and hamburgers); (2) sandwich components (such as flame-grilled hamburgers and chicken patties and Philly steaks) and (3) other entrées and snacks (such as country fried steak, stuffed entrées, chicken tenders and cinnamon dough bites). In Fiscal 2016, 66.7% of our net sales were attributable to the fast-growing ready-to-eat sandwiches and sandwich component categories. Our products are shipped frozen to our customers and sold under our commercial and retail brands, as well as private label and licensed brands. 
 We control more steps within the production process than most of our competitors. This integrated approach allows us to add value throughout our processes, generate attractive margins and provides us with a significant competitive advantage. Our value-added processes include recipe formulation, pre-preparation by chopping, breading, seasoning and marinating, food preparation by baking, charring, frying and grilling, assembly and packaging. Our integrated bread and biscuit production capabilities are a key differentiator due to proprietary formulations that (based on consumer testing data) produce superior tasting sandwiches.

We sell to a diverse set of over 3,000 customers and have an average relationship tenure of approximately 20 years with our top 20 customers and enjoy category captain status (meaning, preferred vendor status), for many of our product categories with our largest foodservice customers. We employ a customer-centric approach, which is rooted in market-leading R&D capabilities, product quality and customer service. We have dedicated marketing and sales teams for each of our channels to serve the specific needs of our customers. In many cases, we collaborate with our customers to develop new products, customizing recipes and flavors in a cost efficient manner. We believe our customer-centric approach gives us a competitive advantage while helping our customers grow their businesses, which, in turn, can lead to accelerated organic growth and profitability. 
 We sell our value-added products to the foodservice, retail and convenience channels, which correspond to our three core segments. We also sell our products in the industrial channel. We believe our diversification across these channels provides us with a stable revenue base through economic cycles. In Fiscal 2016, 54.2% of our net sales were generated from our Foodservice segment, where our commercial brands are highly sought-after and trusted by chefs, cooks and other purchasers. In our Retail segment, in addition to selling our branded products, we also leverage our R&D capabilities to co-create exclusive products and packaging designs with our customers under their private label brands. In our Convenience segment, we are a leading supplier of ready-to-eat sandwiches and sandwich components to national and regional convenience chains and vending providers. 
 We have an attractive financial profile with steady, organic volume growth, healthy margins, modest capital expenditures and limited working capital requirements. These characteristics enable our business to generate strong cash flows. Our earnings profile also benefits from a lean selling, general and administrative (SG&A) cost structure and a scaled, efficient supply chain network. We intend to use these attributes to enhance stockholder value by paying regular dividends, reducing our indebtedness, strategically deploying our capital to fund organic growth opportunities and financing value-enhancing acquisitions. Our values are, Passion for Food, Respect, Integrity, Profitable Growth, Helping One Another and Community. 
 We have expanded our business platform scale through several strategic merger and acquisition transactions: 
 

 | In September 2010, we combined Pierre Foods, Inc., Advance Food Company, Inc. and Advance Brands, LLC. to create our principal wholly-owned subsidiary, AdvancePierre Foods, Inc. Pierre Foods, Inc. was founded in 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, and held leading market positions in handheld sandwiches and other value-added meals and snacks, serving the Foodservice, Retail and Convenience channels. Advance Food Company, Inc. was a family owned business founded in 1973 in Enid, Oklahoma, and was a leading developer, producer and marketer of a wide variety of value-added, portion controlled and ready-to-serve products serving the Foodservice channel. Advance Brands, LLC was formed in 2001 and was a leader in producing convenient chicken and beef products serving the Retail channel.

 | In May 2011, we acquired Barber Foods, a leading producer and marketer of stuffed chicken entrées primarily for the Retail channel.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In January 2015, we acquired the wholesale business and production operations of Landshire, Inc., an Illinois-based producer of premium frozen, ready-to-eat sandwiches. In April 2015, we acquired the business and production assets of Better Bakery, a producer of premium handcrafted stuffed sandwiches.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In October 2016, we acquired Allied Specialty Foods, Inc. (Allied), a producer of fully cooked and raw beef and chicken Philly steak products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We completed an initial public offering (IPO) of our common stock on July 20, 2016, which is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) under the symbol APFH.

Our Recent Performance and the APF Way 
 During the year ended December 28, 2013 (Fiscal 2013) and the year ended January 3, 2015 (Fiscal 2014), we revamped our cost structure, budgeting tools and pricing methodology by implementing a continuous improvement program that we call the APF Way. The APF Way uses a data-driven analytical framework to drive growth and profitability through improved commercial decision-making, excellence in sales and marketing and improved productivity in procurement, logistics and production. We believe that the APF Way has fundamentally changed the cost structure of our business and has been a major factor in our recent volume, sales and profitability growth. Initially, we focused on reducing our cost structure by executing on productivity programs and re-aligning trade promotion allowances, resulting in approximately $157.0 million in implemented annualized savings between Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2016. In addition, we eliminated approximately $155.0 million of sales associated with lower margin contracts. We have invested in new systems and processes that enable us to deliver continuous productivity savings and effectively manage margins and profitability. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin, which we calculate as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales, expanded from 10.9% in Fiscal 2013 to 19.1% in Fiscal 2016, even as our raw material costs varied. In our three core segments, our net sales and volume grew at a compounded annual growth rate of 5.8% and 3.4%, respectively, between Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2016. We believe that these investments and our disciplined-approach will allow us to continue to deliver attractive margins and opportunities for growth. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss). 
 We manage and report our business in four segments, with Foodservice, Retail and Convenience representing our core segments. Our fourth segment, Industrial, consists of sales to other food producers under short-term co-manufacturing agreements. Fiscal 2016 net sales by segment were as follows: 
 


Foodservice. Our Foodservice customers include leading national and regional distributors, who in turn sell our products to end-customers such as restaurant operators, schools, healthcare providers, hospitality providers and the U.S. military. We supply 95 of the largest 100 school districts in the US, directly and through distributors, and work closely with such school districts to develop nutritious, good quality meal options that deliver good value for money. We also directly supply many national restaurant chains. 
 We sell a diverse portfolio of products into the Foodservice channel, including ready-to-eat sandwiches (such as breakfast sandwiches, PB&J sandwiches and hamburgers), sandwich components (such as flame-grilled hamburgers and chicken patties and Philly steaks) and other entrées and snacks (such as country fried steak, stuffed entrées, chicken tenders and cinnamon dough bites). We primarily sell our products under our own commercial brands, which are highly sought-after and trusted by chefs, cooks and other purchasers. For Fiscal 
 
5 
 
 2016, 69.7% of our Foodservice net sales were attributable to our own commercial brands, such as The Pub, Advance, Steak-Eze, Philly Freedom and Smart Picks, and 30.3% to private label brands. 
 As Foodservice operators attempt to differentiate and broaden their product offerings, they are more frequently working with solution-oriented partners with strong new product development capabilities and national distribution scales, such as AdvancePierre Foods. 
 Retail. We serve a wide array of Retail customers including national and regional grocery chains, major warehouse club stores, mass retailers and dollar stores. 
 Key products that we sell into the Retail channel include ready-to-eat sandwiches (such as breakfast sandwiches, grilled chicken sandwiches and stuffed pockets), sandwich components (such as chicken patties and Philly steaks), and other entrées and snacks (such as stuffed chicken breasts). In addition to selling our branded products, we also leverage our R&D capabilities to co-create exclusive products and packaging designs with our Retail customers under their private label brands. For Fiscal 2016, 65.2% of our Retail net sales were attributable to our Retail brands, such as Barber, Pierre and Fast Fixin, 32.5% to private label brands and the rest to licensed brands. 
 Convenience. The Convenience channel represents an important outlet for our ready-to-eat sandwiches and includes sales to vending providers. We currently sell to approximately 90,000 Convenience locations in the US and we are the largest supplier of ready-to-eat sandwiches to vending providers. Currently, we sell to approximately 100,000 vending locations in the US. 
 We partner with our Convenience customers to develop customized, ready-to-eat sandwiches (such as breakfast sandwiches and hamburgers), sandwich components (such as chicken patties), and other entrées and snacks (such as cinnamon dough bites). We are able to meet specific demands from our Convenience customers by providing private label brand products and innovative new products. For Fiscal 2016, 70.5% of our Convenience net sales were attributable to our retail brands, such as BIG AZ, 28.0% to private label brands and the remainder to licensed brands. 
 Industrial. In order to optimize capacity utilization across our production network, we opportunistically enter into short-term co-manufacturing agreements with other food producers, such as packaged food companies. Due to the lower margin nature of this business, we have strategically reduced sales in this segment. As a result, sales from this segment decreased from 15.7% of net sales in Fiscal 2013 to 5.0% of net sales in Fiscal 2016. 
 For additional financial information about our segments, see the audited consolidated financial statements, which are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K (the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Our Products 
 We market and distribute a broad range of great-tasting products across all day parts in multiple product categories, including: (1) ready-to-eat sandwiches (such as breakfast sandwiches, PB&J sandwiches and hamburgers); (2) sandwich components (such as flame-grilled hamburgers and chicken patties and Philly steaks); and (3) other entrées and snacks (such as country fried steak, stuffed entrées, chicken tenders, popcorn chicken and cinnamon dough bites). We market and distribute approximately 2,900 SKUs across all day parts to a diverse mix of customers in our Foodservice, Retail, Convenience and Industrial segments. Many of our products have been customized to fit specific customer needs. In Fiscal 2016, 66.7% of our net sales were attributable to the fast-growing ready-to-eat sandwiches and sandwich component categories. Our products are shipped frozen to our customers and sold under our commercial and retail brands, as well as private label and licensed brands. Additional information related to our products is included in the table below.

 Ready-to-Eat Sandwiches. We are the largest manufacturer of ready-to-eat lunch and dinner sandwiches, and produce over 600 million sandwiches per year, which we ship frozen to our customers. We possess vertically integrated bakery, production and assembly capabilities which differentiate us from our competitors and support high margins in this product category. Our superior bread quality is an important purchase driver for our sandwiches. Our ready-to-eat sandwiches are sold under a variety of our own brands, such as BIG AZ, Pierre, Landshire and Better Bakery, licensed brands and several leading private label brands. 
 Sandwich Components. We are a leading producer of sandwich components, such as flame-grilled hamburger patties (sold under The Pub brand), Philly steaks (sold under the Steak-EZE brand), pork rib patties, chicken patties, meatballs and fajita steaks. All of our sandwich components are also offered under leading private label distributor brands in our Foodservice segment and leading private label brands. 
 Other Entrées and Snacks. We are a leading producer of convenient entrées and snacks, including stuffed entrées (sold under the Barber Foods brand), country fried steak (sold under the Advance brand), chicken tenders (sold under the Fast Fixin brand), crispy sausage snacks and cinnamon dough bites.

Our Strengths 
 We believe the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and will contribute to our ongoing success: 
 Leading Market Positions in Attractive, Growing Categories 
 We hold the number one or number two market share position by sales volume in nearly all of our major product categories and are well positioned to capitalize on growth in our markets. We are the number one player with market shares ranging from approximately 35% to 70% in our top five product categories, which represented 67% of our net sales in Fiscal 2016. Within most of our major product categories, we are the only full-service operator of scale and compete against smaller, regional players with limited product breadth, production capacity and capabilities. We typically do not compete against large packaged food companies given our Foodservice focus and the customization requirements of our customers. 
 We produce over 600 million sandwiches per year and 66.7% of our net sales in Fiscal 2016 were related to ready-to-eat sandwiches and sandwich components. We are a leading provider of lunch and dinner sandwiches to the Foodservice, Retail and Convenience channels. Our superior bread quality is an important purchase driver for our sandwiches. 
 Long-Standing, Collaborative Customer Relationships Create a High Barrier to Entry 
 Our strong customer relationships across a diverse set of customers provide a significant competitive advantage and create a high barrier to entry. For Fiscal 2016, our top ten customers accounted for 58.2% of our net sales, with our three largest customers, Sysco Corporation Inc., U.S. Foods, Inc. and Walmart Stores Inc. (including Sams Club) accounting for 13.7%, 12.3% and 10.8%, respectively, of our net sales in Fiscal 2016. Our three largest customers collectively source over 1,900 SKUs from our portfolio and buy across multiple contracts for a diverse set of end-customers, making us an important supplier and giving us a stable and consistent revenue base. Sales to Sysco Corporation Inc. and U.S. Foods, Inc. are primarily generated in the Foodservice segment. Sales to Walmart Stores Inc. (including Sams Club) is primarily generated in the Retail segment. 
 We have deep and collaborative relationships with an average tenure of approximately 20 years with our top 20 customers and maintain our relationships through our segment-focused marketing teams and an experienced sales force of approximately 100 associates who work closely with customers to meet their needs. Our Foodservice commercial brands are highly sought-after and trusted by chefs, cooks and other purchasers for their consistent food safety, premium quality and taste profile. Given our track record, we enjoy category captain status in many of our product categories. 
 
8 
 
We produce approximately 2,900 SKUs for our customers, who source a high volume and a variety of products from us, making us an important supplier and partner. We expect to continue to have a competitive advantage as our customers focus on large scale suppliers in order to streamline and optimize their supply chains. We offer a differentiated value proposition to our customers due to our scale, broad product portfolio, customization capabilities, national distribution and food safety track record. 
 Leader in On-Trend, Fast-to-Market New Product Development 
 We believe our customer-centric approach, which is rooted in market-leading R&D capabilities, product quality and customer service, differentiates us from our competitors and has allowed us to accelerate our organic growth and improve our profitability. Our product innovation and R&D expertise span areas such as flavor development, recipe formulation, nutrition science, bakery science and food safety. In recent years, we have enhanced our new product development and customer insight capabilities, and, in 2015, we opened a modern and efficient 3,200 square foot R&D facility in West Chester, Ohio. 
 The food industry today is characterized by rapidly changing menus and evolving consumer taste profiles. In this environment, our customers value our ability to co-create new products with flavor profiles that differentiate their offerings and successfully commercialize new products with speed and efficiency. We launched approximately 600 new SKUs in the last three years, accounting for 11.1% of our net sales in Fiscal 2016. Our innovation team along with our sales and marketing teams collaborate with customers to co-create highly customized products and together, they are able to deliver rapid mobilized responses to our customers requests. 
 Scale and Production Efficiency with a National Distribution Footprint 
 We benefit from a national, scaled production, procurement and logistics network with low production, freight and warehousing costs and believe our efficient cost structure provides a sustainable competitive advantage and enables us to offer a customized and varied set of products to our customers at competitive prices. 
 We have two integrated bakery facilities which allow us to source approximately 65% of our bread in-house (excluding bread for our PB&J sandwiches). Our eleven production facilities benefit from economies of scale, which, when combined with our national distribution capabilities, differentiate us from our competitors and make us a valuable supplier for both national and regional customers. Except for the production facility previously owned by Allied, which we acquired in October 2016 and are in the process of improving, all of our facilities have achieved Safe Quality Food (SQF) Level 3 certification, the highest level of such certification from the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). 
 Attractive Financial Profile 
 We have an attractive financial profile with steady, organic volume growth in our core segments, healthy margins, modest capital expenditures and limited working capital requirements. 
 We are able to deliver attractive Adjusted EBITDA margins due to the high value-added nature of our products. Our margin profile is well protected given our ability to proactively adjust pricing frequently to reflect input cost movements with minimal lag time. Only 17.9% of our net sales in Fiscal 2016 were subject to fixed price arrangements. We also have a lean and scalable cost structure and plan to continue leveraging the APF Way to deliver operational productivity savings, improve our business mix and increase the effectiveness of our trade promotion allowances. 
 Our business has relatively low capital expenditure requirements, with maintenance expenditures typically averaging approximately 1% of our net sales.

Proven Acquisition Expertise 
 We have a successful track record of sourcing, executing and integrating acquisitions, beginning with the combination of Pierre Foods, Inc., with Advance Food Company, Inc. and Advance Brands, LLC in 2010. Given our scale and breadth of capabilities, we believe we are well positioned to consolidate the fragmented industry in which we operate. We maintain a highly disciplined approach to acquisitions, focusing on opportunities that diversify our products, add production capabilities, expand production capacity and allow for meaningful synergy realization. In addition to realizing cost synergies, we leverage our sales teams to expand distribution of newly acquired brands and products and cross-sell across our channels to drive sales synergies. 
 Since 2011, we have completed four accretive acquisitions. In June 2011, we acquired Barber Foods, a producer of premium stuffed entrées, which strengthened our retail presence and expanded our chicken-based product offering. In January 2015, we acquired the wholesale business and production assets of Landshire, which broadened our portfolio of premium sandwiches to include sliced meat sandwiches and added incremental, margin-enhancing baking and assembly production capabilities. In April 2015, we acquired the business and production assets of Better Bakery to expand into stuffed sandwiches, one of the largest ready-to-eat sandwich categories. In October 2016, we acquired Allied, a producer of beef and chicken Philly steak products, which we expect will expand our market position in Philly steaks by adding fully cooked product offerings. The addition of Allied also expands our geographic reach and increases our sandwich component production capacity. 
Talented Management Team with a Track Record of Driving Growth and Reducing Costs 
 We have assembled an experienced management team through the strategic hiring of key leaders. We have also expanded our organizational capabilities in R&D, sales and marketing. Our management team has an average of 25 years of expertise in the Foodservice, Retail and Convenience industries and has demonstrated its ability to deliver on key strategic actions, which have transformed our business performance. In the last two years, our management teams key accomplishments include implementation of the APF Way, the successful integration of two value-enhancing acquisitions and significant margin improvement. 
 Between October 2013 and November 9, 2016, our management team was led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, John Simons. On November 9, 2016, in response to Mr. Simons planned retirement in 2017, we announced a succession and transition plan for the President and Chief Executive Officer positions. As part of the plan, Christopher Sliva, who has over a decade of experience as a public food company executive, became our President and a member of our board of directors. It is anticipated that Mr. Simons will remain as our Chief Executive Officer until March 31, 2017, when he will retire and be succeeded by Mr. Sliva as our President and Chief Executive Officer. 
 Our Strategy 
 Expand Our Market Leading Positions in Growing Channels and Categories 
 We are focused on expanding our leadership position within our core segments of Foodservice, Retail and Convenience, and believe the ready-to-eat breakfast sandwich category is a key growth opportunity for us. We hold the number one position, with a 47% market share, in breakfast sandwiches sold in the Convenience channel, based on a survey that we compiled in 2014. We are also the largest supplier of private label breakfast sandwiches in the Retail channel, with a 71% market share, according to IRI data prepared in 2016. Private label sales of Retail frozen breakfast sandwiches is an underpenetrated market compared with the frozen food market, and, therefore, we believe that area is poised for significant growth. We will continue to leverage our sandwich expertise and customer relationships to grow our market share in breakfast sandwiches in the Retail channel, with Foodservice distributors and with schools. 
 We believe we have multiple growth opportunities across our core segments. In Foodservice, we plan to expand distribution of our products to new customers, such as national chains, schools and hospitality providers. 
 
10 
 
 In Retail, in addition to growing our sandwich business, we are launching product extensions for Barber Foods and Better Bakery and expanding distribution within rapidly growing dollar stores. In Convenience, we are expanding our breakfast product portfolio, refreshing core items and expanding our launch of Better Bakery products. We are also expanding our lineup of products to take advantage of recent consumer trends, and have successfully launched snacking-oriented products, such as PB&J snack bars and cinnamon dough bites, as well as better-for-you products, such as all natural breaded poultry. 
 Drive Growth Through Focus on Innovation 
 Our product categories offer the potential for value-added product innovation. We believe our innovation capabilities, combined with our investments in consumer insights and our ability to partner with customers to co-create products, will enable us to continue to introduce successful new products to drive sales growth and margin improvement across our portfolio. 
 Our R&D team is focused on developing products in line with key consumer trends, such as breakfast sandwiches, better-for-you products and snacking-oriented products. Examples of products in our innovation pipeline include ready-to-eat breakfast sandwiches that meet the new K-12 nutrition guidelines, premium offerings for club stores and new limited time offers for key Convenience store chain customers. We are also partnering with various customers to develop on-trend, protein-based snacks. 
 Deliver Attractive Margins through Dynamic Pricing and the Leveraging of the APF Way 
 We believe that we are well positioned to deliver attractive margins given the high value-added nature of our products, our dynamic pricing model and our ability to generate ongoing productivity savings by leveraging the APF Way. In addition, our focus on improving our product mix, leveraging our scalable organizational structure and realizing synergies from acquisitions supports our margin profile. Under the APF Way, we are implementing multiple programs across the areas of production, procurement, commercial and logistics that we expect will deliver ongoing productivity savings and help offset potential operational headwinds and cost inflation. 
 Acquire Value-Enhancing Businesses 
 We believe our scale and integration expertise allows us to make value-enhancing acquisitions. We operate in a highly fragmented industry with many opportunities to execute accretive transactions. For example, in October 2016, we acquired Allied, a producer of beef and chicken Philly steak products, which we expect will expand our market position in Philly steaks by adding fully cooked product offerings. The acquisition of Allied will also expand our geographic reach and increase our sandwich component production capacity. Our integration expertise allows us to rapidly capture cost synergies and we are able to generate revenue synergies by leveraging existing customer relationships and marketing expertise to cross-sell products across channels. Our management team has an active pipeline of acquisition opportunities and maintains a regular dialogue with potential targets. 
Capital Return and Leverage Reduction 
 We believe our capital structure enables us to invest in our business and reduce our indebtedness, thereby creating value for our stockholders. We also expect to return capital to our stockholders through regular dividend payments. We paid regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.14 per share in the third and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2016 (September 28, 2016 and December 6, 2016), and declared a dividend on February 16, 2017 of $0.16 per share for first quarter 2017, which was paid on March 6, 2017. The 2017 first quarter dividend reflects an increase of 14.3% and we expect to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends, subject to the approval of our Board of Directors.

Our Customers 
 We have a few large customers that account for a significant portion of our sales. Sysco Corporation, U.S. Foods, Inc. and Walmart Stores Inc. (including Sams Club) accounted for 13.7%, 12.3% and 10.8%, respectively, of our net sales in Fiscal 2016. Our three largest customers source over 1,900 SKUs from our portfolio and buy across multiple contracts for a diverse set of end-customers, making us an important supplier and giving us a stable and consistent sales base. No other customer contributed 10% or more to our net sales in Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 or Fiscal 2014. Our top ten customers accounted for 58.2% of our net sales in Fiscal 2016. In Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, the top ten customers accounted for 53.4% and 54.7%, respectively. 
 Customers located in the US account for almost all of our net sales. Sales to customers located outside of the US totaled $15.6 million, $15.4 million and $20.0 million in Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, respectively. None of our long-lived assets were located outside of the US during Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 or Fiscal 2014. 
 Our Sales and Distribution Functions 
 We maintain sales and distribution functions to support sales within our three core segments and have approximately 145 employees within our segment-specific sales and marketing teams. We also rely on our 19-member customer service team. In addition, our 46-member demand management team manages customer forecasts, orders, deliveries and feedback. 
 Foodservice. Approximately 30 marketing professionals, 70 direct sales representatives and 15 national and regional brokers service our diverse field of Foodservice customers. A Foodservice-specific go-to-market team is responsible for developing tailored marketing and sales solutions for our customers. Our marketing and sales teams interact directly with major participants in the Foodservice distribution chain, including distributors, redistributors, contract management companies, group purchasing organizations and large end-use operators. We service the majority of our Foodservice customers through distributors, but we also ship directly to select customers, including large school districts, select national restaurant chains and the U.S. military. 
 Retail. We employ approximately 15 marketing professionals, 15 direct sales representatives and 10 national and regional brokers to service our retail customers. Our sales and marketing teams are designed to provide direct support to our top retail customers, to facilitate responsive and rapid product development, in addition to effective in-store promotion planning and execution. For smaller customers, we work closely with our network of sales brokers to meet the needs of these customers. Most Retail customers either collect their products from our distribution centers or request that we deliver products to their distribution centers. Certain smaller customers receive shipments from redistributors that collect products from our distribution centers. 
 Convenience. Six marketing professionals, nine direct sales representatives and 13 national and regional brokers service our Convenience customers. The team provides direct support to our top Convenience customers, thereby facilitating responsive and rapid product development, in addition to effective in-store promotion planning and execution. For smaller customers, we work closely with our network of sales brokers and distributors that deliver products to stores. The majority of large Convenience customers receive products through distributors, while smaller customers often receive products through national and regional distributors. 
 Industrial. One sales representative within our Industrial segment is responsible for sourcing business to fill any excess capacity identified within our production facilities. 
 Our distribution centers are located in Enid, Oklahoma, Cincinnati, Ohio and Rockmart, Georgia. Approximately one-third of our volume is picked up at our production facilities or distribution centers by our customers. For the remainder of our volume, we utilize third-party logistics providers to deliver products to customers and redistributor warehouses.

Our R&D Capabilities 
 In recent years, we have enhanced our new product development and customer insight capabilities and, in 2015, we opened a modern and efficient 3,200 square foot R&D facility in West Chester, Ohio. Our R&D expertise spans the spectrum of food development from meat technology and flavor development, to production and processing, ingredient bakery science and nutrition formulation. 
 In addition, our customer-centric model allows us to quickly respond to customer requests, particularly as we co-develop products with our customers to bring new ideas to market. We station satellite R&D teams in our primary production hubs where they can directly leverage the facilities capabilities when developing and scaling new products. Our central in-house R&D team is based in West Chester, Ohio and consists of over 50 professionals, including chefs, food scientists and packaging engineers who are focused on new product development, product-quality improvements, productivity improvements and package development. 
 We introduced 269, 179 and 172 new SKUs, in Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, respectively. New products released during Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 accounted for 11.1% of our net sales in Fiscal 2016. R&D expenditures totaled $8.9 million, $6.6 million, $6.0 million for Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, respectively. Our R&D team is currently focused on the development of on-trend products, such as handheld breakfast sandwiches, better-for-you and snacking-oriented products. Examples of projects in our innovation pipeline include ready-to-eat breakfast sandwiches that meet the new K-12 nutrition guidelines, premium offerings for club stores and new limited time offers for key Convenience store chain customers. We are also partnering with some of our customers in the development of on-trend, protein-based snacks. 
 Our Ingredients and Packaging 
 We believe that the ingredients and packaging used to produce our products are readily available through multiple sources. Our primary ingredients include beef, poultry, pork, bread, breadings, cheese, eggs, seasonings, soy proteins and corn. Packaging costs account for a significantly smaller portion of our costs of goods sold than our ingredients. To mitigate the impact of commodity cost fluctuations, we enter into a variety of purchasing arrangements with certain of our suppliers, including those that supply us with proteins, seasonings and packing supplies. We have not historically entered into hedging agreements for our ingredients or packaging supplies. 
Quality and Food Safety 
 Quality and food safety are paramount to us. As a result, we have developed, implemented and enforced a robust quality and food safety program. 
 The quality control teams in our production facilities are independent and report directly to our corporate quality and food safety team, a central function comprised of approximately 17 employees headed by our Senior Vice President, Quality, who reports directly to our President. This structure creates strong accountability for the quality and safety of our products at a senior level within our company. There are approximately 175 salaried and hourly quality control employees located at our production facilities. 
 We have implemented the SQF program at all of our facilities. SQF is a fully integrated food safety and quality management protocol designed by GFSI specifically for the food sector. The SQF code offers a comprehensive methodology in food safety and quality management. The SQF certification by GFSI provides an independent and external validation that a product, process or service complies with international, regulatory and other specified standards. Except for the production facility previously owned by Allied, which we acquired in October 2016, all of our production facilities have achieved SQF Level 3 Food Safety Certification, the highest level of such certification from GFSI. We also maintain systems in all of our factories that verify and validate compliance with federal, state and local regulations. 
 High quality raw materials are available to us from multiple sources and we source the raw materials used in our products from a variety of high quality suppliers that are regulated by the US Department of Agriculture 
 
13 
 
 (USDA). In order to protect the quality and safety of our products, we regularly inspect our suppliers production facilities and delivered products. As part of our quality and food safety program, our professionals continuously work with the applicable regulatory agencies, including the USDA and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the academic community, trade associations and our industry partners to stay informed of emerging issues as we continuously seek to improve and enhance food safety and quality. 
 Despite our commitment to quality and food safety, we have previously issued recalls for our products. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Business. If our products become contaminated or are mislabeled, we may be subject to product liability claims, product recalls and increased scrutiny by regulators, any of which could adversely affect our business. 
 Competition 
 We face competition in each of our respective product categories and end markets. Although we operate in a highly competitive industry, we believe that the breadth and depth of our product portfolio and product quality, have resulted in strong market share positions for us. Within most of our major product categories, we are the only full-service operator of scale and compete against smaller, regional players with limited product breadth, production capacity and production capabilities. We typically do not compete with large packaged food companies given our Foodservice focus and the customization requirements of our customers. Smaller players include CTI Foods, Devault Foods, Lopez Foods and JTM Food Group. In certain product categories, such as breakfast sandwiches and entrées and snacks, we compete with larger players such as Hormel Foods Corp., Hillshire, Nestle and The J.M. Smucker Company. We compete, among other things, on the basis of product quality, total product portfolio, price, customer service, ability to meet customer demands, effective consumer marketing, promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences. 
Seasonality 
 We sell a large percentage of our products to schools, directly and through distributors, which subjects our sales volumes and, thus, our operating results, to seasonal variations. Our quarterly operating results are affected by the seasonal fluctuations of our sales and operating income. In Fiscal 2016, we derived 16.6% of our consolidated net sales and 30.6% of our Foodservice segment net sales from schools. Because schools comprise a significant portion of our customer base, sales of our products tend to be lower during the summer months. These lower sales volumes negatively impact our operating profits during the third quarter of each fiscal year. As a result of these fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our net sales and operating income among different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful. 
Information Systems 
 We operate a single enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for substantially all of our facilities for operations, procurement, receiving, warehousing, inventory management and order processing. We also have an integrated suite of supporting financial, demand planning and material requirements planning (MRP) software modules that are effectively integrated into our core ERP platform. This enterprise-wide systems platform provides us with four key advantages. First, it provides us with real-time financial and operational reports that enable rapid decision-making and execution. Second, we efficiently process orders and ship to our customers on a one order, one invoice basis. Third, we can efficiently and cost-effectively manage the forecasting, production and inventory complexity associated with our portfolio of approximately 2,900 SKUs. In addition, our common information technology allows us to integrate acquisitions and achieve synergies quickly. We expect the integration of Allied to be substantially complete by July 1, 2017.

Government, Legal and Regulatory 
 Food Safety, Product Identity, Branding and Labeling 
 We are subject to extensive regulation, including, among others, the Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, the Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, the USDA Pathogen Reduction: Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Systems rule of 1996, the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness & Response Act of 2002, the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 and other rules and regulations promulgated by the FDA, the USDA and the sub-branches of these regulatory bodies relating to the production and introduction of human foods to commerce. These comprehensive and evolving regulatory programs govern, among other things, the manufacturing, composition, ingredients, labeling, packaging and safety of food, including compliance with specific current good manufacturing practice regulations. In addition, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 prescribes the specifics, format and content of information required to appear on the labels of food products. 
 In addition to complying with federal laws and regulations pertaining to food production, we are also required to comply with local municipality (city and county) as well as state regulations, including the registration and licensing of our plants, enforcement by state health agencies of various state standards and inspection of our facilities. 
 Compliance with federal, state and local regulation is costly and time-consuming, but is one of our top priorities. Regulatory enforcement actions for violations of federal, state and local regulations may include seizure and condemnation of products, mandatory or voluntary product recalls, cease and desist orders, injunctions and monetary-civil-criminal penalties. We believe that our practices are sufficient to maintain compliance with applicable government regulations, although there can be no assurances in this regard. It is also possible that new laws or regulations, or changes in the enforcement of existing requirements, might require us to change our compliance programs, incur additional costs or result in unexpected liabilities that could be significant. 
 Employee Safety Regulations 
 We are subject to certain health and safety regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing, health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. 
Environmental Regulations 
 We are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulations and requirements, including those governing discharges to air and water, the management of hazardous substances, the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences for us, including criminal as well as civil and administrative penalties, limitations on our operations, claims for remediation costs, as well as alleged personal injury or property damages and negative publicity. 
 From time to time, we are involved in administrative or legal proceedings relating to environmental, health and safety matters, and have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures to avoid violations of these laws and regulations. 
 Based on information currently available to us, we do not expect that costs relating to environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. However, there can be no guarantee that newly discovered information, more stringent enforcement of or changes in environmental requirements, or other unanticipated events will not result in significant costs.

Insurance 
 We maintain insurance in amounts and on terms that we believe are customary for a company like ours. Our insurance policies include, but are not limited to, policies that provide coverage for general and product liability, product contamination, property damage, workers compensation, business interruption and director and officer liability. In addition, we maintain excess insurance where we reasonably believe it to be cost effective. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 4,500 employees, of which approximately 900 were salaried. None of our employees are unionized, except for approximately 90 unionized employees of Allied. The collective bargaining agreement covering the unionized employees of Allied expires in April 2020. We believe we have good relationships with our employees. However, any increased unionization, work stoppage or labor disruptions due to our failure to renegotiate union contracts or increased labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Business.
