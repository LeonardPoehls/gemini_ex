Item 1.   Business.
Background 
 
Prism Technologies Group, Inc. was originally incorporated in California in February 1995 and re-incorporated in Delaware in October 1996. The mailing address of our headquarters is 101 Parkshore Drive, Suite 100, Folsom, CA 95630, and the telephone number at that location is (916) 932-2860. Our principal website is www.przmgroup.com.
 
From our inception through December 21, 2011, we operated an online insurance marketplace that electronically matched consumers and providers of automobile, property, health, term life and small business insurance. We discontinued this business in connection with the sale of substantially all of our assets (the “Disposition”) to Bankrate, Inc. in a transaction that closed on December 21, 2011 (“Disposition Date”). On the Disposition Date and in connection with the Disposition, we changed our name from InsWeb Corporation to Internet Patents Corporation. Since the Disposition Date, our business has consisted of licensing and enforcing a portfolio of patents relating to technology that we developed or acquired.
 
On March 26, 2015 (the “Closing Date”), we completed our acquisition of Prism Technologies, LLC (“Prism”), with Prism becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger”). Prism is a Nebraska limited liability company headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. Prism has two primary operating subsidiaries: Secure Axcess, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and Millenium Biologix, LLC, a Nebraska limited liability company. Prism also operates a patent licensing and enforcement business. Prism and its subsidiaries own a portfolio of patents with over 50 issued patents in the areas of computer and network security, semiconductors and medical technology. In September 2015, we changed our name to Prism Technologies Group, Inc. to better reflect the operations of the combined companies.
 
In the Merger, Prism’s former members received an aggregate of $16.5 million in cash and 3.5 million shares of our common stock. Subject to certain conditions, we also agreed to share future revenue related to Prism’s patents with Prism’s former members up to a maximum amount of approximately $49.5 million. Our board of directors and officers and Prism’s officers did not change following the Merger, except that Gregory J. Duman, a manager, executive officer and former member of Prism, was appointed to our board of directors.

Overview of our Business
 
Our future revenues, if any, are expected to consist of royalties from licensing our patents and damages for past infringement. In addition to general and administrative expenses, we expect to incur expenses associated with patent infringement litigation, including contingency fees arrangements with our attorneys and revenue sharing payments to third parties, both of which are typically based on a negotiated percentage of the gross settlement amount or award of money damages.
 
The importance of protecting inventions has been recognized in the United States since the adoption of the U.S. Constitution. Article I, section 8, of the U.S. Constitution authorizes Congress:
 
To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.
 
Patents in the United States are governed by the Patent Act (35 U.S. Code), which established the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO). The most common type of patent is a utility patent. Utility patents have a duration of twenty years from the date of filing, but are not enforceable until the day of issuance. To obtain protection under U.S. law, the applicant must submit a patent application to the USPTO, where it will be reviewed by an examiner to determine if the invention is patentable.
 
A patent owner is entitled to exclude others from making, selling or using the patented invention for the life of the patent, generally for a period of twenty years from our filing date, with some possible term extensions provided by statute. The patent holder may grant one or more licenses to the patented invention, typically allowing the licensee to make, use and/or sell the patented invention in return for a royalty paid to the patent owner. A patent owner also may sue and recover damages from unlicensed parties for past patent infringement and sometimes future royalties. Although we intend to attempt to negotiate a reasonable royalty for licenses to our patented technologies, we may not be able to reach a negotiated settlement with the accused infringer. In that case, we expect to vigorously litigate our infringement claims. 
 
Patent infringement lawsuits often last more than two years from the date the complaint is filed until a trial is concluded, unless the parties are able to settle the dispute before the conclusion of the trial. The timeframe is influenced by a number of factors, including the jurisdiction in which the case is filed. Patent litigation also is costly. A 2015 report from the American Intellectual Property Law Association estimates that the median litigation cost of a patent infringement lawsuit is $5 million where the amount in controversy exceeds $25 million. The costs consist of outside and local counsel, associates, paralegal services, travel and living expenses, fees and costs for court reporters, copies, couriers, exhibit preparation, analytical testing, expert witnesses, translators, surveys, jury advisors and similar expenses. Patent holders, however, often enter into contingent fee arrangements under which outside counsel are paid a percentage of the proceeds from the litigation or settlement.
 
A third party sued for patent infringement often will challenge the validity of the patent-in-suit in an administrative proceeding before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”). Such proceedings can result in a final determination by the USPTO that some or all of the patent claims are not patentable. Unless the adverse patentability ruling from the USPTO is overturned on appeal, any pending or future litigation involving those claims would be dismissed. The post grant review process and subsequent appeals often take more than 18 months to complete.

Our Patent Portfolio
 
The following table describes our patent portfolio as of March 30, 2017:
 

Patent Family | Technology | Potential Market Applications 
---------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gregg Patents | Device Authentication, Access to Protected Resources | Wireless and Mobile Commerce Online Content Delivery Software Activation Corporate Systems Access Banking and Financing Services Electronic Commerce
Glazer Patents | Image Recognition, Web Site Authentication | Online Banking and Financial Services

Prism Technologies Group Patents | E-Commerce | Online retail and financial services 

 
All of the patents described above, other than the Gregg Patents and the Prism Technologies Group Patents, were acquired from third parties, many of whom have a continuing right to receive a portion of the proceeds, if any, from our patent licensing and enforcement activities with respect to these acquired patents.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had eight full-time employees, four of whom are parties to three-year employment agreements. We have never had a work stoppage among our employees, and no employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our future success will depend in part on the continued service of our senior management. 
Competition
 
Although other companies perform services similar to ours, we believe that each of our patents represents a unique technology. We therefore do not believe that we face direct competition in enforcing our patents. However, we may from time to time seek to acquire additional patents, and we expect to compete with other patent enforcement firms in acquiring additional patents. We may also compete with venture capital firms and various industry leaders for patent licensing opportunities. We also face a form of competition known as royalty stacking. Royalty stacking refers to situations in which a single product potentially infringes on many patents, and thus may bear multiple royalty burdens. Our customers’ willingness and ability to pay reasonable royalties is, in part, affected by the number of patents infringed by a particular customer product, the concentration of the holders of those patents, the customer’s cost of licensing those patents, and the profitability of the infringing product. 
 
The key competitive factors include financial and management resources, the breadth and scope of the patent portfolio, experience in patent licensing, reputation as a licensee, litigation history and licensing strategy for the subject portfolio. Some of our competitors have more financial and management resources than we do.
