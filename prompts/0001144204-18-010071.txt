ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation (MIC) is the successor to Macquarie Infrastructure Company LLC (MIC LLC) pursuant to the conversion (the Conversion) of MIC LLC from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation on May 21, 2015. MIC LLC was formed on April 13, 2004. Except as otherwise specified, all references in this Form 10-K to MIC, we, us and our refer (i) from and after the time of the Conversion, to Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation and its subsidiaries and (ii) prior to the Conversion, to the predecessor MIC LLC and its subsidiaries. Except as otherwise specified, all references in this Form 10-K to common stock or shares refer (i) from and after the time of the Conversion, to common stock and (ii) prior to the Conversion, LLC interests. 
 MIC Level Strategy 
 We intend to own, efficiently operate and grow a diversified portfolio of infrastructure and infrastructure-like businesses with the aim of producing an attractive risk adjusted total stockholder return. We intend to achieve this by:

 | providing optimal service levels while maintaining the highest safety, environmental and governance standards;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | prudently deploying and/or opportunistically recycling capital in efforts to:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | grow our existing businesses; and
--+----------------------------------


 | develop and acquire additional businesses;
--+-------------------------------------------


 | optimizing price, volume and margin;
--+-------------------------------------


 | effectively managing expenses;
--+-------------------------------


 | optimizing capital structures and tax planning; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | realizing both cross-selling and cost synergies across our businesses.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect these efforts over time, collectively, to produce growth in the amount of cash generated by our businesses and growth in our stockholder dividend. 
 General 
 We currently own and operate a diversified portfolio of businesses that provide services to other businesses, government agencies and individuals primarily in the U.S. The businesses we own and operate are organized into four segments:

 | International-Matex Tank Terminals (IMTT): a business providing bulk liquid terminalling to third parties at 17 terminals in the U.S. and two in Canada; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Atlantic Aviation: a provider of fuel, terminal, aircraft hangaring and other services primarily to owners and operators of general aviation (GA) jet aircraft at 70 airports throughout the U.S.; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Contracted Power (CP): comprising electricity generating assets including a gas-fired facility and controlling interests in wind and solar facilities in the U.S.; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | MIC Hawaii: comprising an energy company that processes and distributes gas and provides related services (Hawaii Gas) and several smaller businesses collectively engaged in efforts to reduce the cost and improve the reliability and sustainability of energy in Hawaii. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to the businesses we own and operate in these segments, we also invest in the development of new businesses. These new businesses may be added to one of our existing segments or sold (with the resulting capital redeployed into any or all of our existing operations), or may, over time, form the basis of entirely new segments. For example, we have invested in a joint venture with a developer of solar power facilities, Intersect Power, with the expectation that the projects that may result from this will be either sold or added to our portfolio of contracted power facilities. The majority of these activities are being reported as a

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 component of the segment to which any new businesses would be added. If an appropriate segment does not exist, the activities are recorded as a component of Corporate and Other. 
 We buy, develop and invest in the growth of our businesses based on a general assumption that we will own them indefinitely. It is neither our intent nor our expectation that we will divest of a business at a particular point in our ownership or as a result of having achieved certain targets, financial or otherwise. This view of ownership as a long-term relationship does not preclude sales or recycling of assets when we believe that we have either maximized the amount of value in the asset relative to our capability, or the asset is more highly valued by another owner. We may, depending on our ability to access additional debt or equity capital on what we consider attractive terms, sell businesses or assets to generate capital for reinvestment in new or existing businesses at what we believe could be improved returns. With respect to new developments, sales may occur more opportunistically. In general, we have redeployed the proceeds from these asset sales in the development of our remaining businesses either through investment in growth projects or acquisitions of small, bolt-on operations consistent with our view of MIC as a long-term owner. 
 Deployment of growth capital has been and is expected to continue to be an important part of our strategy and the creation of stockholder value. Our sources of growth capital include the retained capital generated by our businesses but not distributed as a cash dividend to our stockholders, capital generated through the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities, or the proceeds from the sale of entire or portions of certain businesses. Over time, we expect to deploy growth capital of approximately $350.0 million per year in projects and bolt-on acquisitions across all of our businesses. Importantly, although we find value in diversification and the generally uncorrelated nature of the businesses in our current portfolio, we are not obligated to invest in the growth of any one business or segment or the addition of any new segment. 
 Equally important, we seek to drive stockholder value by focusing on business performance improvement. These efforts include upgrading systems, implementing data analytics tools, developing cross business efficiencies and deployment of enterprise-wide procurement strategies among others. In 2017, we formed MIC Global Services (MGS), a new entity into which we have begun to consolidate support functions across all of our businesses. We believe that MGS will generate significant savings relative to the cost of maintaining these functions separately in each of our operating companies. A portion of the costs associated with the operation of MGS are allocated to each of our operating companies. Any unallocated MGS costs are reported as a component of our Corporate and Other segment. We expect the implementation of MGS to deliver expense reductions (both Cost of Services/Product Sales and Selling, General and Administrative expenses) of between $10.0 million and $15.0 million in 2018 relative to a 2016 baseline. 
 Businesses 
 Our businesses, in general, are defined by a combination of the following characteristics:
 
 | ownership of long-lived, high-value physical assets that are difficult to replicate or substitute around;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a platform for the deployment of growth capital;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | broadly consistent demand for their services;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | scalability, such that relatively small amounts of growth can generate disproportionate increases in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the provision of basic, often essential services;
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | generally predictable maintenance capital expenditure requirements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | generally favorable competitive positions, largely due to high barriers to entry, including:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | high initial development and construction costs;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | difficulty in obtaining suitable land on which to operate;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | high costs of customer switching long-term concessions, leases or customer contracts; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | lack of immediate, cost-effective alternatives for the services provided.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 The different businesses that comprise our Company exhibit these above characteristics to different degrees at different times. For example, macro-economically correlated businesses like Atlantic Aviation may exhibit more volatility during periods of economic downturn than businesses with substantially contracted revenue streams. While not every business that we own will meet all of the general criteria described above, we seek to own a diversified portfolio of businesses that possesses a balance of these characteristics. 
 In addition to the benefits associated with these characteristics, net margins generated by most of our businesses tend to keep pace with historically normal rates of inflation. The price escalators built into many customer contracts, and the inflation and cost pass-through adjustments that are typically included as part of pricing terms, serve to insulate our businesses to a significant degree from the negative effects of inflation and commodity price risk. 
 Our Manager 
 We are a party to a Management Services Agreement with Macquarie Infrastructure Management (USA) Inc. (Manager). Our Manager is a member of the Macquarie Group, a diversified international provider of financial, advisory and investment services. The Macquarie Group is headquartered in Sydney, Australia and is a global leader in the management of infrastructure investment vehicles on behalf of third-party investors and advising on the acquisition, disposition and financing of infrastructure assets. 
 We pay our Manager a monthly base management fee based primarily on our market capitalization and holding company net debt and excluding debt in support of specific operating entities. For this, in accordance with the Third Amended and Restated Management Services Agreement (Management Services Agreement), the Manager provides normal ongoing corporate center functions such as facilities, technology, employee benefits and access to services including human resources, legal, finance, tax and accounting among others. Our Manager is responsible for and oversees the management of our operating businesses, subject to the oversight and supervision of our board of directors. Our Manager compensates and has assigned, or seconded, to us employees to serve as our chief executive officer and chief financial officer on a full-time basis. It also compensates and seconds or makes other personnel available as required. MIC has no employees at the holding company level. 
 Our Manager may also earn a performance fee if the quarterly total return for our stockholders (capital appreciation plus dividends) is positive and exceeds the quarterly total return of a U.S. utilities index benchmark, both in the quarter and cumulatively. If payable, the performance fee is equal to 20% of the difference between the benchmark return and the total return for our stockholders during the quarter. Per the terms of the Management Services Agreement, our Manager currently reinvests its fees, whether base or performance fees, in shares of our common stock. The Manager may elect to receive either base or performance fee, if any, in cash but may only change its election during a 20 trading day window following our earnings release. Any change would apply to fees incurred thereafter. 
 Our Businesses 
 Use of Non-GAAP measures 
 In addition to our results under U.S. GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures to assess the performance and prospects of our businesses. In particular, we use EBITDA excluding non-cash items, Free Cash Flow and certain proportionately combined financial metrics. Proportionately combined financial metrics reflect our proportionate interest in our wind and solar facilities. 
 We measure EBITDA excluding non-cash items as it reflects our businesses ability to effectively manage the volume of products sold or services provided, the operating margin earned on those transactions and the management of operating expenses independent of the capitalization and tax attributes of those businesses. 
 In analyzing the financial performance of our businesses, we focus primarily on cash generation and Free Cash Flow in particular. We believe investors use Free Cash Flow as a measure of our ability to sustain and potentially increase our quarterly cash dividend and to fund a portion of our growth. 
 See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Results of Operations  Consolidated  Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) excluding non-cash items, Free Cash Flow and Proportionately Combined Metrics in Part II, Item 7, for

IMTT 
 Industry Overview 
 Bulk liquid terminals provide an important link in the supply chain for a broad range of liquid commodities (see below). Bulk liquid terminals provide vital logistics services to vertically integrated petroleum product producers and refiners, chemical manufacturers, food processors and commodity traders. Customers typically pay terminal operators such as IMTT on an availability basis to provide tank capacity, loading and unloading access, and pipeline and trans-loading capacity, and also pay additional fees for ancillary services such as heating and blending. 
 Both domestic and international factors influence demand for bulk liquid terminals in the U.S. Demand for storage rises and falls according to local and regional consumption. In addition, import and export activity accounts for a material portion of the business. Shippers require storage for the staging, aggregation and/or distribution of products before and after transport. The extent of import/export activity depends on macroeconomic trends, such as currency fluctuations, as well as industry-specific conditions, such as supply and demand imbalances in different geographic regions. Demand for storage is also driven by fluctuations in the current and perceived future price and demand for the product being stored and the resulting temporal price arbitrage. 
 Potential entrants into the bulk liquid terminals business face several barriers. Strict environmental regulations, availability of suitable land with connectivity to pipeline and transport logistics, including marine road and rail infrastructure, local community resistance and initial investment costs may limit the construction of new bulk liquid terminals. These barriers are typically higher around waterways near major urban centers. As a consequence, new tanks are generally built where existing docks, pipelines and other infrastructure can support them. However, restrictions on land use, difficulties in securing environmental permits, and the potential for operational bottlenecks due to constraints on related infrastructure may limit the ability of existing terminals to expand the storage capacity of their facilities. 
 Business Overview 
 IMTT is one of the larger independent providers of bulk liquid terminal services in the U.S., based on capacity. IMTT handles products for a diverse range of domestic and foreign markets and end users. IMTT stores or handles primarily refined petroleum products, various commodity and specialty chemicals, renewable fuels and vegetable and tropical oils (collectively liquid commodities). Crude oil constitutes an immaterial portion of IMTTs overall storage and handling operations. The business operates a network of 19 terminals including 17 in the U.S. and two in Canada (one partially owned) with principal operations in the New York Harbor market and on the Lower Mississippi River. 
 Since our initial investment in IMTT in May 2006, we have deployed capital in the growth and development of additional storage capacity, facilities and related infrastructure (pipes, pumps, docks, etc.) and acquisitions of facilities in Illinois and a portfolio of terminals primarily in the U.S. Southeast (Epic Midstream LLC (Epic)). Consistent with IMTTs strategy below, we expect to be able to continue to deploy capital in the growth and expansion of storage capacity and capabilities provided that they generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
 IMTT also owns OMI Environmental Solutions (OMI), an environmental emergency response, industrial services, waste transportation and disposal business.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 IMTT  (continued) 
 Locations 
 As of December 31, 2017, IMTT comprised the following facilities and storage capacity, not including tanks used in packaging, recovery tanks, and/or other storage capacity not typically leased. 

Facility | Land | | Aggregate Capacity of Storage Tanks in Service (Millions of Barrels) | Percent of Ownership
Facilities in the United States: | | | | | | | 
Lower Mississippi River Terminals (4) | | Owned | | | 20.8 | 100.0 | %
Bayonne Terminal | | Owned | | | 15.9 | 100.0 | %
Other Terminals (12) | | Owned | | | 6.9 | 100.0 | %
Facilities in Canada: | | | | | | | 
Quebec City, Quebec | | Leased | | | 2.0 | 100.0 | %
Placentia Bay, Newfoundland | | Leased | | | 3.0 | 20.1 | %
Total | | | | | 48.6 | | 

 IMTT facilities generally operate 24 hours a day providing customers with prompt access to a wide range of logistical services. In each of its two key markets, IMTTs scale ensures availability of sophisticated product capabilities. IMTT continues to improve its facilities speed and flexibility of operations by investing in upgrades of its docks, pipelines and pumping infrastructure and facility management systems. 
 Lower Mississippi River Terminals (52% of gross profit) 
 On the Lower Mississippi River, IMTT currently operates four terminals (St. Rose, Gretna, Avondale and Geismar). With combined storage capacity of 20.8 million barrels, the four sites give IMTT substantial market share in the storage and handling of refined petroleum products, bulk liquid chemicals, vegetable and tropical oils on the strategically important Lower Mississippi River. These terminals serve a predominantly export market. 
 The Lower Mississippi River facilities also give IMTT a substantial presence in a key domestic transport hub. The Lower Mississippi River serves as a major transshipment point between the central U.S. and the rest of the world for agricultural products (such as vegetable and tropical oils) and commodity chemicals (such as methanol). The region also has substantial traffic related to the petroleum industry. Lower Mississippi River refiners and traders send products to other regions of the U.S. and overseas and use IMTTs Lower Mississippi River facilities to perform some of these functions. These facilities enjoy relatively unencumbered marine and road access when compared to other, more congested waterways such as the Houston Ship Channel. As oil production in North America has increased and refining has shifted to processing of lighter gravity feedstocks, exports of gasoline and distillates from the Lower Mississippi River region have increased. 
 Bayonne Terminal (37% of gross profit) 
 Located on the Kill Van Kull between New Jersey and Staten Island, New York, the 15.9 million barrel capacity terminal occupies an attractive position in New York Harbor where it has substantial market share. New York Harbor serves as the main petroleum trading hub in the northeast U.S. and a physical settlement site for certain futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In addition to waterborne shipments, products reach New York Harbor through petroleum product pipelines from the U.S. Gulf region and elsewhere. New York Harbor also serves as the starting point for refined product pipelines linked to inland markets and as a key port for refined petroleum product imports and exports. IMTT-Bayonne has more dock capacity than other terminals in New York Harbor, connections to the Colonial, Buckeye and Harbor refined petroleum product pipelines as well as rail and road connections and blending capabilities. As a result, IMTT-Bayonne provides its customers with logistical flexibility.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 IMTT  (continued) 
 IMTT-Bayonne has the capability to quickly load and unload the largest bulk liquid transport ships entering New York Harbor. The ability to provide scale terminal services to its customers is also an important competitive advantage. The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers has dredged the Kill Van Kull channel passing the IMTT-Bayonne docks to 50 feet (IMTT has dredged two of its docks to 47 feet). Most of IMTTs competitors in New York Harbor have facilities located on the southern portion of the Arthur Kill (water depth of approximately 37 feet) and force large ships to transfer a portion of their cargoes to barges (a process known as lightering) before docking. This technique increases the cost and time associated with loading and unloading. 
Competition 
 The competitive environment in which IMTT operates varies by terminal location and product. The principal competition for each of IMTTs facilities comes from other bulk liquid terminals located in the same regional market. Secondary competition for IMTTs facilities comes from bulk liquid terminals located in the same broad geographic region as IMTTs terminals. For example, IMTTs Lower Mississippi River facilities indirectly compete with bulk liquid terminals located on the Houston Ship Channel. 
 Independent terminal operators generally compete on the basis of the location, connectivity and versatility of facilities, service and price. The services typically provided by the terminal include, among other things, the safe storage of the product at specified temperature, moisture and other conditions, as well as receipt and delivery from the terminal, all of which must be in compliance with applicable environmental regulations. A favorably located terminal will have access to various cost-effective transportation modes, both to and from the terminal. Transportation modes typically include waterways, railroads, roadways and pipelines. A terminal operators ability to obtain attractive prices is often dependent on the quality, versatility and reputation of the facilities owned by the operator. 
 IMTT faces significant competition from a variety of international, national and regional energy companies, including large, diversified midstream entities, global terminal operators and large multi-national energy companies. We believe that IMTT is favorably positioned to compete in the industry due to the strategic location of terminals on the Gulf Coast and in New York Harbor and certain secondary markets, our reputation, the prices we charge for our services and the connectivity, quality and versatility of our services. In particular, we believe that IMTTs proximity to petroleum and chemical refineries in both of its key markets and to the very substantial end use market in the Northeast are sources of competitive advantage and provide diversity in our revenue drivers. 
 As noted above, we believe that significant barriers to entry exist in the terminalling business. These barriers include significant capital requirements and execution risk, a lengthy permitting and development cycle, financing challenges, a finite number of sites suitable for development, operating expertise and customer relationships. 
 Customers 
 IMTT provides bulk liquid terminal services primarily to vertically integrated petroleum product producers and refiners, chemical manufacturers, food processors and commodity traders. These customers, in turn, serve a range of end users in both domestic and foreign markets. Within its terminals, IMTT has the ability to repurpose tanks and related infrastructure for various bulk liquid products both to respond to and to anticipate changes in customer demand. IMTT does not depend on a single customer, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on IMTT.
 For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 50% of IMTTs revenue was generated by its top ten customers, of which seven were rated investment grade and three were not rated. Customers typically sign contracts which, among other things, provide for a fixed periodic payment (usually monthly) for access to and use of IMTTs facilities. This payment may be expressed in terms of cents per barrel of capacity, a dollar amount per unit of infrastructure, or a dollar amount per month. These amounts are payable whether the customer uses the facilities and services or not and does not include additional charges for thruput or ancillary services. In 2017, approximately 80% of IMTTs revenues were generated from these availability style payments for terminal capacity.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 IMTT  (continued) 
 IMTT is responsible for ensuring appropriate care of products stored at its facilities and believes it maintains adequate insurance with respect to its exposure. IMTT does not have material exposure to commodity price fluctuations because it typically does not purchase or market the products that it handles. IMTTs customers retain title to products stored and have responsibility for securing insurance or self-insuring against loss or fluctuation in value. 
Regulation 
 The rates that IMTT charges for its services are not subject to regulation. However, a number of regulatory agencies, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Department of Transportation, Department of Homeland Security and the United States Coast Guard, regulate IMTTs operations. IMTT must comply with numerous federal, state and local environmental, occupational health and safety, security, tax and planning statutes and regulations. These regulations require IMTT to obtain and maintain permits to operate its facilities and impose standards that govern the way IMTT operates its business. If IMTT does not comply with the relevant regulations, it could lose its operating permits and/or incur fines and increased liability. While changes in environmental, health and safety regulations pose a risk of higher operating costs, such changes are generally phased in over time to manage the impact on both the industry and the business. 
 Few of IMTTs facilities require significant environmental remediation. Those that do have such efforts are overseen by various state and federal agencies. Remediation efforts entail removal of the free product, groundwater control and treatment, soil treatment, repair/replacement of sewer systems, and the implementation of containment and monitoring systems. These remediation activities are expected to continue for an additional ten to twenty years, or more. See Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3, for further discussions. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, IMTT (excluding the Newfoundland terminal) had a total of 1,100 employees, of which 270 employees were unionized. We believe relations with both union and non-union employees at IMTT are good. 
 The day-to-day operations of IMTT are managed by individual terminal managers who are responsible for most aspects of the operations. IMTTs operations are overseen by senior personnel with significant experience in the bulk liquid terminals industry. Management of the business is headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Atlantic Aviation 
 Industry Overview 
 Fixed based operations (FBOs) primarily service the GA segment of the air transportation industry. Local airport authorities own the airport properties and grant FBO operators a lease to provide fueling and other services pursuant to long-term ground leases. Fueling services provide the majority of an FBOs revenue and gross margin. 
 FBOs often operate in environments with high barriers to entry. Airports tend to have limited physical space for additional FBOs and airport authorities generally do not have an incentive to add FBOs unless there is a significant demand for additional services. Securing airport approvals and completing the design and construction of a new FBO can take over a year and require significant capital expenditures. Furthermore, airports typically impose minimum standards with respect to the experience, capital investment and breadth of services provided by the FBO. 
 The ownership of FBOs in the U.S. is fragmented with the majority of facilities individually owned and operated rather than part of networks. Consolidation has been and is expected to continue to be an important feature of the industry as larger networks are able to achieve economies of scale in fuel and insurance purchasing, marketing and back office operations when acquiring locations from individual owners/operators. 

10



 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Atlantic Aviation  (continued) 
 Demand for FBO services is driven by the level of GA flight activity which is defined as the number of take-offs and landings in a given period. We believe GA flight activity will continue to expand at rates broadly consistent with overall economic activity in the U.S. 
Business Overview 
 At December 31, 2017, Atlantic Aviation operated FBOs at 70 airports in the U.S. Atlantic Aviations FBOs provide fuel, terminal, aircraft hangaring and other services to owners/operators of GA aircraft, but also to commercial, military, freight and government aviation customers. 
 Atlantic Aviation has been a part of the MIC portfolio since our IPO. In December 2004, the business owned and operated a total of 16 FBOs. Through a roll-up of FBOs, we have increased the size of the network to a total of 70 facilities. Consistent with our strategy of seeking to optimize the portfolio, we have exited markets we believe have limited growth potential in favor of entering those with better prospects. Since our IPO, we have deployed capital in Atlantic Aviation in the acquisition of FBOs and projects including the construction of terminals and aircraft hangars, fuel tank farms, aircraft parking (ramps) and a range of smaller projects.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Atlantic Aviation  (continued) 
 Operations 
 Atlantic Aviation operates high-quality facilities and focuses on attracting customers who desire personalized service. Fuel sales generated 63% of gross margin in 2017. Other services, including de-icing, aircraft parking and hangar rental, provided the balance. Fuel is stored in tank farms and each FBO operates refueling vehicles owned or leased by the FBO to move fuel from the tank farms to the aircraft being serviced. The FBO either owns or has access to the fuel storage tanks to support its fueling activities. At some of Atlantic Aviations locations, services are also provided to commercial airlines, freight operators, and military and government users. Services provided to the airlines may include refueling from the airlines own fuel supplies, de-icing and/or ground and ramp handling services. 
 Atlantic Aviation buys fuel at a wholesale price and sells fuel to customers either at a contracted price, or at a price negotiated at the point of purchase. While wholesale fuel costs can vary, Atlantic Aviation generally passes changes in fuel costs through to customers and seeks to maintain and, when possible, increase its dollar-based margin per gallon. In general, the business has minimal exposure to commodity price fluctuations as it carries a limited inventory of jet fuel. 
 Atlantic Aviation is focused on managing costs effectively and continuously evaluates opportunities to reduce expenses. Such opportunities may include business reengineering, more efficient purchasing, partnering with service providers and/or capturing synergies in acquisitions.

 Atlantic Aviations FBOs operate pursuant to long-term leases from the airport authorities who own or manage the airport. Atlantic Aviation works with these airport authorities to optimize lease lengths through capital improvements or other enhancements to the airport. 
 Atlantic Aviations EBITDA-weighted average remaining lease length (at Atlantic Aviations discretion) was 20.3 years and 19.6 years at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, notwithstanding the passage of one year. The increase reflects successful lease renewals and acquisition of facilities with leases longer than the current network-wide average. The leases at seven of Atlantic Aviations FBOs, collectively accounting for approximately 9.0% of Atlantic Aviations gross margin, are expected to be renegotiated and extended within the next five years. No individual FBO generated more than 10% of Atlantic Aviations gross margin at December 31, 2017. 
 The airport authorities have certain termination rights in each of Atlantic Aviations leases. Standard terms allow for termination if Atlantic Aviation defaults on the terms and conditions of the lease, abandons the property or becomes insolvent or bankrupt. Most of the leases allow for termination if liens are filed against the property. Fewer than twenty leases may be terminated for convenience or other similar reasons. In these cases, generally, there are compensation agreements based on amortization schedules or obligations of the airport authority to make best efforts to relocate the FBO. 
 Atlantic Aviation periodically evaluates its portfolio of FBOs and occasionally concludes that some of its sites do not have sufficient scale or do not serve a market with sufficiently strong growth prospects to warrant continued operations at these locations. In these cases, it may elect to sell the site or not renew the lease upon maturity. 
 Marketing 
 Atlantic Aviation has a number of marketing programs, each utilizing an internally-developed point-of-sale system that tracks GA flight movements. This program supports flight tracking and provides customer relationship management data that facilitates up-selling of fuel and optimization of revenue per customer. 
 Atlantic Aviation also maintains a loyalty program for pilots known as Atlantic Awards that provides an incentive to purchase fuel from Atlantic Aviation. These awards are recorded as a reduction in revenue in Atlantic Aviations consolidated financial statements.

 Competition 
 Atlantic Aviation competes with other FBO operators at more than half of its locations, and its facilities may also face indirect competition from FBOs located at nearby airports. The FBOs compete on the basis of location of the facility relative to runways and street access, service, safety, value-added features, reliability and price. Each FBO also faces competitive pressure from the fact that aircraft may take on sufficient fuel at one location and not need to refuel at a specific destination. 
 Atlantic Aviations main competitors are Signature Flight Support, Jet Aviation, Million Air, Sheltair Aviation and TAC Air. To our knowledge, other than the competitors listed, no competitor operated more than 20 FBOs in the U.S. at December 31, 2017. 
 Customers 
 Atlantic Aviation does not depend on a single customer, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the business. 
 Regulation 
 The aviation industry is overseen by a number of regulatory agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Transportation and Environmental Protection Agency, but its primary regulator is the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In addition, local airport authorities also regulate the FBOs. The business must comply with federal, state and local environmental statutes and regulations associated in part with the operation of fuel storage tank systems and mobile fueling vehicles. These requirements include tank and pipe testing for tightness, soil sampling for evidence of leaking and remediation of detected leaks and spills. 
 Atlantic Aviations FBOs are subject to regular inspection by federal and local environmental agencies as well as local fire departments and other agencies. The business does not expect that compliance and related remediation work, if any, will have a material negative impact on earnings or the competitive position of Atlantic Aviation. The business has not received notice requiring it to cease operations at any location or of any abatement proceeding by any government agency as a result of failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, the business employed 1,961 people, of which 196 employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe relations with both union and non-union employees at Atlantic Aviation are good. 
 The day-to-day operations of Atlantic Aviation are managed by individual site managers who are responsible for most aspects of the operations at their site. Atlantic Aviations operations are overseen by senior personnel with significant experience in the aviation industry. 
 Contracted Power 
 Industry Overview 
 The power industry represents a large and critical infrastructure market, both in terms of the number and value of facilities as well as their contribution to overall economic activity. In developed economies, capital spending in the sector is driven by aging infrastructure, new technologies, increased legislation regarding emissions, the use of renewable energy and modest demand growth. 
 The Energy Information Administration, an agency of the U.S. Federal Statistical System, forecasts the demand for electricity in the U.S. to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 0.9% over the next thirty years. As aging and inefficient generating capacity is retired or replaced, opportunities for deployment of capital in the growth of our CP segment are expected to increase.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Contracted Power  (continued) 
 Growth in the electricity generating sector of the industry has been driven by a combination of portfolio optimization and a significant number of renewable power projects being developed as a result of the adoption of Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS). RPS are state-level regulatory mandates that obligate utilities and other load-serving entities to provide a specific portion of their electricity generation from qualifying renewable technologies by a specified date. 
Business Overview 
 At December 31, 2017, CP consisted of controlling interests in seven solar facilities, two wind facilities and a 100% interest in a gas-fired facility. Our portfolio of solar facilities consists of two facilities in Arizona, two in California, one in Texas, one in Minnesota and one in Utah. These facilities have an aggregate generating capacity of 142 megawatts (MW). Our wind facilities are located in Idaho and New Mexico and have a combined generating capacity of 203 MW. The gas-fired facility, Bayonne Energy Center (BEC), has a generating capacity of 512 MW with a further 130 MW under construction, and is located in Bayonne, New Jersey, adjacent to IMTTs Bayonne terminal. 
 The renewable facilities utilize arrays of photovoltaic solar panels or wind turbine generators to convert energy from sunlight or wind into electricity. The electricity is aggregated and fed directly into regional power grids. These technologies tend to produce a predictable amount of electricity within the bounds of seasonal and annual variability in insolation and wind. The business also generates Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) based on the amount of electricity provided to off-takers. These RECs are either bundled with the electricity under the terms of the Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) or sold separately to third-parties. The BEC facility currently comprises eight natural gas turbine power generating sets (installed in 2012) and is being expanded by two additional sets. Power produced by BEC is transmitted via a dedicated cable beneath New York Harbor to a substation in Brooklyn, New York, from where it is distributed into the New York City power market. 
 The renewable facilities sell electricity to creditworthy off-takers, typically pursuant to multi-year contracts. Existing contracts include either long-term PPAs or subscription agreements whereby a counterparty has contracted with one of our projects for the sale of electricity and related services for a set period of time. These contracts provide a hedge against volatility in revenue from fluctuations in demand or price. The majority of BECs output is contracted with a creditworthy power wholesaler that has entered into tolling agreements with BEC for 62.5% of the facilitys capacity. The weighted average remaining life of the tolling agreements was approximately ten years at December 31, 2017. The tolling agreements generate revenue whether or not the facility is in use for power production. The remaining 37.5% of the facilitys capacity that is currently untolled generates revenue from monthly capacity payments and ancillary services provided to support grid stability whether or not the facility is dispatched, and an energy margin when the facility is dispatched. 
 In late 2015, we commenced the process of expanding the generating capacity of BEC by two turbines totaling approximately 130 MW in incremental generating capacity. This expansion is expected to reach mechanical completion by the end of the first quarter of 2018 and is anticipated to begin producing revenue in the second quarter of 2018. In addition, we have made two investments in renewable energy development companies that each have a pipeline of either new wind and solar projects. We expect to continue to seek attractive investment opportunities in renewable energy production and distribution projects and to pursue expansion opportunities at our existing facilities.

Strategy 
 Our CP businesses are pursuing a strategy that has four principal components: 
 
1. | to deliver cost-competitive electricity in a safe and reliable manner;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | to deploy additional capital at attractive risk-adjusted returns by developing or acquiring renewable energy projects across a range of technologies and geographies;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | to improve productivity, reduce costs and increase efficiencies; and
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | to opportunistically recycle capital through the sale of selected facilities or assets.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operations 
 Operation and maintenance (O&M) of the CP facilities is largely performed by our employees or by third-party service providers. Land for all our facilities is either leased under long-term contracts or owned by the facilities. Other costs such as insurance are based on annual contracts. Accordingly, a significant portion of the operating costs of these facilities is highly predictable. The business regularly evaluates which O&M services are best provided by employees or third-party service providers and has started to perform some of these O&M services itself in order to reduce costs and improve operational performance of its facilities. 
Customers 
 The primary customers of the contracted power business are creditworthy counterparties including utilities and a power marketer. These customers have entered into long-term PPAs, subscription agreements or tolling agreements with remaining terms ranging from approximately 10 to 24 years as of December 31, 2017. 
Seasonality 
 Each CP facility has a unique seasonality profile based on factors including weather and energy demand. The solar projects generate a disproportionate amount of their revenue in the summer months when insolation is highest, while wind energy revenues are generally stronger in the winter months. BEC is a peaking power plant that is dispatched when demand for power increases above the base generating capacity in New York City. This means that BEC is dispatched more often in the summer and winter months. 
Competition 
 The contracted portion of CPs business is not subject to substantial direct competitive price pressure due to the long-term nature of the PPAs, subscription agreements and tolling agreements. However, our existing BEC facility has incremental generating capacity that is not tolled and is sold into the spot power market. After the expiration of the respective PPAs, subscription agreements or tolling agreements, such facilities may face greater competition. Once completed, the expansion units at BEC will also operate on an untolled basis and will be subject to market competition.

 Regulation 
 The power and energy sectors are the subject of substantial and complex laws, rules and regulations. Sector regulators include the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). The FERC has jurisdiction over the transmission and wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce and over the transportation, storage and certain sales of natural gas in interstate commerce, including the rates, charges and other terms and conditions for such services. The NERC serves to establish and enforce reliability standards applicable to all users, owners and operators of the bulk power system. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also oversees certain environmental matters related to the construction and operations of CPs electricity generating facilities. 
 The New York competitive wholesale electricity market in which BEC participates is administered by the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). NYISO is a not-for-profit agency that serves to ensure regional grid reliability, comprehensive planning, and open and efficient markets. BEC is also subject to certain New York State and New York City regulations and to environmental regulations by the State of New Jerseys Department of Environmental Protection. 
 Each of the wind and solar facilities comprising CP is subject to regulation and oversight in the jurisdiction in which they operate. 
 Employees 
 At December 31, 2017, the CP businesses had six employees.
 We believe relations with employees of our CP businesses are good. 
 MIC Hawaii 
 Industry Overview 
 According to the Energy Information Administration, the Hawaii energy market consumes 282 trillion British Thermal Units (BTU) annually, split approximately equally between the transportation market and the industrial/commercial/residential markets. Gas in Hawaii has an approximately 2% share of the total energy market and serves primarily the residential and commercial markets with applications including water heating, drying, cooking, emergency power generation and other select uses. 
 Beginning in 2008 with the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative (HCEI), the State of Hawaii embarked on a program to be a leader in the development and deployment of clean energy solutions. The HCEIs goals include energy independence and security, a transition away from imported fuels and the development of a green economic sector. 
 In 2017, over 25% of Hawaiis electricity was generated from renewable sources, where the primary sources were solar, wind, and biomass. Hawaiis geographic location, the high cost of electricity from oil-fired electric generation, and the States renewable portfolio standard offer the potential to increase the amount renewables-based electric and gas-fired generation. MIC Hawaii has invested in multiple renewable energy projects and expects to pursue further growth opportunities in line with Hawaiis energy goals. 
 Business Overview 
 MIC Hawaii comprises Hawaii Gas and several smaller businesses collectively engaged in efforts to reduce the cost and improve the reliability and sustainability of energy in Hawaii. From 2006 to 2015, our MIC Hawaii segment consisted solely of Hawaii Gas, a combination of Hawaiis only government-franchised gas utility and an unregulated liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) distribution business. Founded in 1904, Hawaii Gas serves Hawaiis 1.4 million residents and 9.4 million visitors across Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Kauai, Molokai and Lanai (the main islands).

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 MIC Hawaii  (continued) 
 Hawaii Gas comprises a regulated gas utility and an unregulated LPG distribution business. The utility business includes the processing, distribution and sale of synthetic natural gas (SNG) and renewable natural gas (RNG) and the distribution and sale of re-gasified liquefied natural gas (LNG) on the island of Oahu and the distribution and sale of LPG via pipeline on all of the main islands. The unregulated business distributes LPG by truck to individual tanks located on customer sites or distributes LPG in cylinders filled at central locations to customers on all the main islands. The gas distributed by Hawaii Gas has a wide range of commercial and residential applications and LPG is also used as a fuel for specialty vehicles such as forklifts. Users include residential customers and a wide variety of commercial, hospitality, military, public sector and wholesale customers. 
 In 2016, MIC Hawaii expanded its presence in the Hawaiian energy complex with the development of the 7 MW Waihonu Solar facilities on Oahu and an acquisition of a design-build mechanical contractor. In 2017, we expanded our investments, adding two distributed generation projects serving commercial users under long-term contracts. 
 Hawaii Gas primary products consist of: 
 Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG):  The business converts a light hydrocarbon feedstock (naphtha) into SNG which has a similar heating value to natural gas. Hawaii Gas operates the only SNG processing capability in Hawaii at its plant located on the island of Oahu. SNG is delivered by underground pipelines to utility customers throughout Oahu. 
 Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG):  LPG is a generic name for a mixture of hydrocarbon gases, typically propane and butane. LPG liquefies at a relatively low pressure under normal temperature conditions and can be efficiently transported in a range of quantities. LPG is typically stored in cylinders or tanks and Hawaii Gas maintains the largest network of LPG storage throughout Hawaii. Domestic and commercial applications of LPG are similar to those of natural gas and SNG. 
 Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG):  LNG is transported to Hawaii in conventional intermodal cryogenic containers from the U.S. mainland. Hawaii Gas utilizes LNG to offset up to 30% of the naphtha used to produce SNG and to supply customers of the regulated utility on Oahu. 
 Renewable Natural Gas (RNG):  In August 2016, the City and County of Honolulu awarded Hawaii Gas a contract for offtake of approximately 800,000 BTUs per year of biogas from the Honouliuli Wastewater Treatment Plant commencing in late 2018. The business continues to evaluate a range of additional renewable feedstock sources including other waste water treatment plants, landfills and locally produced biomass.

4. | to maintain positive relationships with regulators, government agencies, customers, the communities MIC Hawaii serves and other stakeholders.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customers 
 The businesses of MIC Hawaii provide services to commercial, residential and governmental customers. MIC Hawaii does not depend on any single customer, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the business. 
Utility Regulation 
 Hawaii Gas utility business is regulated by the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (HPUC). The HPUC exercises broad regulatory oversight and investigative authority over all public utilities in Hawaii. 
 Rate Regulation.  The HPUC establishes the rates that Hawaii Gas can charge its utility customers via cost of service regulation. Although the HPUC sets the base rate for the gas sold by Hawaii Gas utility business, Hawaii Gas is permitted to pass through changes in its fuel costs by means of a monthly fuel adjustment charge. 
 Hawaii Gas utility rates are established by the HPUC in periodic rate cases typically initiated by Hawaii Gas. The business initiates a rate case by submitting a request to the HPUC for an increase in rates based upon, for example, increased costs related to providing services. Following initiation of the rate increase request and submissions by other intervening parties of their positions on the rate request, and potentially an evidentiary hearing, the HPUC issues a decision establishing the revenue requirements and the resulting rates that Hawaii Gas will be allowed to charge. On August 1, 2017, Hawaii Gas filed a general rate case application with the HPUC requesting an annual increase in regulated revenues of $15.0 million. To the extent that new rates are approved by regulators, we expect that interim rate increases, if any, could take effect in mid-2018. 
 Other Regulations.  In addition to regulating utility rates, the HPUC acts on requests for the acquisition, sale, disposition or other exchange of utility properties, including mergers and consolidations; acts on requests for financings; and approves material supply contracts.
Competition 
 Depending upon the end-use, Hawaii Gas competes with conventional and renewable electric generators as well as other gas providers. Electricity in Hawaii is generated by four electric utilities and various independent power producers. In addition, residential and some commercial customers in Hawaii have increased the rate at which they are installing distributed solar photovoltaic generating capacity. 
 Hawaii Gas Utility Business.  Hawaii Gas holds the only government franchise for utility gas services in Hawaii. This enables Hawaii Gas to utilize public easements for its pipeline distribution systems. This franchise also provides for the exclusive use of extensive below-ground distribution infrastructure that Hawaii Gas owns and maintains. Hawaii Gas competes on the basis of price, reliability and the energy preferences of its customers. 
 Hawaii Gas Non-Utility Business.  Hawaii Gas sells LPG in an unregulated market on the main islands of Hawaii. There are several other wholesale and small retail distributors that compete in the LPG market. Hawaii Gas believes it has a competitive advantage because of its established customer base, storage facilities, distribution network and reputation for reliable service.

 Fuel Supply, SNG Plant and Distribution System 
 Fuel Supply 
 Hawaii Gas sources naphtha feedstock for its SNG plant from Par Hawaii Refining, LLC pursuant to a feedstock supply agreement in place through December 31, 2020. The majority of Hawaii Gas LPG is purchased from an off-island supplier with the remainder purchased from the local refineries. Hawaii Gas sources LNG from a U.S. West Coast supplier pursuant to a contract through July 2021. RNG is purchased from the City and County of Honolulu under a fixed rate contract through December 31, 2024. 
SNG Plant and Distribution System (Utility Business) 
 Hawaii Gas processes and distributes SNG from a plant located west of the Honolulu business district. The life of the plant continues to be extended through routine maintenance and additional capital investments. A 22-mile transmission pipeline links the SNG plant to a distribution system at Pier 38 in south Oahu. From Pier 38, a pipeline distribution system consisting of approximately 900 miles of distribution and service pipelines transports gas to customers. On islands other than Oahu, LPG is distributed by direct deliveries from an off-island supplier by ship and by barge from Oahu to holding facilities or base-yards on those islands. It is then distributed via pipelines to utility customers. Approximately 90% of the Hawaii Gas pipeline system is on Oahu. 
Distribution System (Non-Utility Business) 
 The non-utility business of Hawaii Gas provides LPG to customers on each of the main islands who are not connected to Hawaii Gas utility pipeline system. The majority of Hawaii Gas non-utility customers are on islands other than Oahu. LPG is transported to these islands by direct deliveries from an off-island supplier by ship and by barge from Oahu. Hawaii Gas also owns the infrastructure by which it distributes LPG to its customers, including harbor pipelines, trucks, several holding facilities and storage base-yards on Kauai, Maui and Hawaii. 
Environmental Permits 
 The businesses of MIC Hawaii require environmental operating permits, the most significant of which are air and wastewater permits required for the Hawaii Gas SNG plant. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, MIC Hawaii had 599 employees, of which 417 are subject to the terms of various collective bargaining agreements. We believe relationships with both union and non-union employees are good. 
Consolidated 
 Our Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, our consolidated businesses employed approximately 3,800 people, of which approximately 23% of these were subject to collective bargaining agreements. The MIC holding company does not have any employees.
