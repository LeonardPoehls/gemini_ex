Item 1. Business.
General Overview
 
Freedom Leaf Inc. (“Freedom Leaf” and the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 21, 2013, under the name of Arkadia International, Inc. The Company was originally engaged in the business of the acquisition of in demand equipment, cars, and goods with the intent to resell these in the U.S. territories or export to overseas countries.
 
On October 3, 2014, the Company experienced a change in control. Richard C. Cowan acquired a majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company in accordance with stock purchase agreements by and between Mr. Cowan and Vladimir and Galina Shekhtman (“Sellers”). On the closing date, October 3, 2014, pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Cowan purchased from the Sellers 6,950,100 shares of the Company’s outstanding restricted common stock for $100,000, representing 93% of the total issued and outstanding at that time.
 
On November 6, 2014, the Company merged with Freedom Leaf Inc., a private Nevada corporation. The Company changed its name from Arkadia International, Inc., to Freedom Leaf Inc. As a result of the merger, the private company was dissolved, the sole officer, director and shareholder of the private company, Clifford J. Perry, became an officer and director of the Company, and Mr. Perry received approximately 48.1% of the Company’s common stock post-merger.
 
For financial reporting purposes, this merger was accounted for as a "reverse merger" rather than a business combination, and the private company was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction, with the Company deemed to be the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the operations that have been reflected in the historical financial statements of the Company prior to the merger are those of the private company, and were be recorded at the historical cost basis of the private company, and the financial statements after completion of the merger include the combined assets and liabilities of the Company and the private company, the historical operations of the private company only, and the operations of both companies from the closing date of the merger.
 
We are currently devoting our efforts to the news, arts and entertainment niche, both in print and online publications, and to providing services to the cannabis/hemp industry. The Company generates revenue through paid advertising in publications, print and online, in the cannabis/hemp marketplace. The Company earns revenue from 1) providing consulting services to companies who are in our industry, 2) contracting with companies to brand, market, and sell their products and/or services, 3) providing seminars in this space, 4) selling branded products for the Company and others the Company represents, 5) selling licenses, both domestic and foreign, for the use of the Freedom Leaf brand that includes the Company’s products and services, and 6) pursuing mergers and/or acquisitions having instituted an accelerator that began working with one company starting during the year ended June 30, 2017.
 
Our corporate headquarters are located at 3571 E. Sunset Road, Suite 420, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89120. The Company’s primary web site is www.freedomleaf.com. This web site is not incorporated in this Form 10-K.

The Industry
 
The following is a report on the industry, as published in ArcView Group’s State of Legal Marijuana Markets 5th Edition.
 
A Year Of Substantial Gains Across The Industry
 
The legal cannabis industry accelerated at a remarkable pace in 2016. North American consumers spent $6.7 billion on legal cannabis products, up 34% from 2015.
 
Cannabis is now legally sold in state-of-the-art retail dispensaries with computer-based inventory and sales tracking, fully regulated and taxed by their state governments just like any other product category. Entrepreneurs are modernizing the product just as quickly. Many successful brands have launched extracts, edibles, topicals, and other types of products that are leading consumers to spend more and, in cutting-edge Colorado, they have reduced traditional dried flowers to less than 56% of the business. More states passed laws to open new markets and expand existing ones in 2016 than in any previous year. These new markets will drive sustained revenue growth in the years ahead.
 
The legislatures of Pennsylvania and Ohio legalized medical cannabis in those major swing states, while voters in California, Maine, Nevada, and Massachusetts North Dakota, Florida, and Montana voters passed medical cannabis laws. The blistering 34% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2014 to 2016 was driven primarily by Colorado and Washington initiating adult-use sales. This rate of growth will subside somewhat in 2017 to 22%, as the eight states that voted to open or expand their cannabis markets on Election Day in November 2016 work to implement the new programs. But Arcview Market Research forecasts growth will reaccelerate beginning in 2018, as adult use sales ramp up in Canada, California, and Massachusetts along with medical sales in Florida. That will grow the $6.7-billion market of 2016 at a robust 27% CAGR to $22.6 billion in 2021.

Very few consumer industry categories reach $5 billion in annual spending and then post anything like 25% compound annual growth across the following five years. Cable television came close, growing 19% annually in the late 1980s as national networks like CNN and HBO proved to be wildly popular. Broadband internet subscription spending grew 29% per annum in the early 2000s as it became almost as much of a “must have” utility as electricity or television for the modern home. What became the ubiquitous home video business that birthed the great Blockbuster success story only grew at a 12% CAGR after reaching $5 billion in revenue in 1988.
 


That 20+% annual growth rate is likely to continue for many years past 2021 as more states and countries legalize cannabis. Arcview includes 30 states plus Canada with active legal markets by 2021 in its model, but in many of the largest markets, like New York and Florida, sales are expected to remain limited to medical-use. In the 2021-2026 period, however, many of these states will build robust legal adult-use markets, and all but a few states will make medical cannabis available legally.
 
It’s also likely that US federal prohibition will be repealed during that period, which would fuel explosive growth.
 
Canada and Mexico are included in Arcview’s North American market projections for the first time and analyzed throughout this 5th Edition of The State of Legal Marijuana Markets. The expected roll-out of Canada’s adult-use market is analyzed. The U.S. northern neighbor may be the world leader in moving toward a well-regulated legal cannabis industry. Countries around the world are already responding to the state-by-state dismantling of prohibition in America — the chief exporter of the “War on Drugs” for decades—by moving to allow medical use (as in Australia, Germany, and Colombia) or to outright legalization (as in Uruguay).
 
Robust growth through 2021 and beyond in the United States is predicted even if the US Justice Department opposes the cannabis industry. Chapter 2 provides a detailed analysis of why that kind of reversal in policy is unlikely, but a major one is the popularity of legal cannabis.
 
Polls show that 80% of Americans approve of legal access to medical cannabis and 60% approve of full adult use legalization. That level of agreement is rare on any policy issue and it’s allowing elected officials across the political spectrum to start to move past the stigma previously associated with this issue.
 
One key reason support for legalization is spreading so rapidly is that it is accomplishing a key goal: the illicit market is shrinking. The illicit market grew steadily throughout the last 40 years of the War on Drugs to what Arcview estimates was a North American total of $46.8 billion when adult-use sales first began in 2014 in Colorado and Washington. Illicit sales are now being rolled back at the fastest rates in those states with the most mature legal adult use markets (see graph, below). Most dramatically, what Arcview estimates was a $1-billion illicit market in Colorado is now less than $500 million, which represents just 27% of a $1.8-billion overall market.

Election Results
 
President Donald Trump said in 1991, “You have to legalize drugs to win that war.” He backed away from that position in his campaign for president but was remarkably consistent in his support for medical access to cannabis and his belief that cannabis policy should be up to the states. But once elected he appointed dedicated drug warrior Jeff Sessions for Attorney General. Sessions remarked “Good people don’t smoke marijuana” at a 2015 Congressional hearing. Despite conflicting signals from the new administration, investors and entrepreneurs have many other reasons to be hopeful:
 
• The newly elected Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, took office in late 2015 and immediately started the formal process of legalizing adult use.
 
• In the US November elections, voters in eight of the nine states voting on cannabis measures approved them, bringing to 63% the portion of Americans living in medical use states and 21% those in adult-use states.
 
• For the first time, the Presidential nominees of both major U.S. political parties felt free to speak approvingly of the medical use of cannabis and the right of states to experiment with different cannabis policies.
 
• In December, the Mexican Senate voted overwhelmingly (98-7) to send a medical-use legalization bill to the Chamber of Deputies.
 
These developments were inconceivable just a few years ago. The biggest political win of the U.S. election came in California. California pioneered the modern cannabis policy reform movement in 1996 when voters passed Proposition 215, the Compassionate Care Act. Though voters failed to approve adult use in 2010, they voted overwhelmingly in 2016 to make adult use legal in a state that represents the world’s sixth-largest economy. Nevada also voted to legalize adult use, though a similar initiative failed narrowly in Arizona. Massachusetts and Maine also passed voter-generated initiatives to legalize the adult use of cannabis, joining District of Columbia voters in showing the continent-wide breadth of the movement.
 
The formalizing of medical-use rules in Montana, and the approval of medical cannabis sales in Arkansas, North Dakota, and Florida (where it garnered 71% of the vote) showed that cannabis policy reform is hugely popular, even in red and swing states that voted for Trump. Earlier in the year, big swing states Ohio and Pennsylvania saw medical legalization come to pass via legislative action.
 
The two most significant votes may have come in the smallest jurisdictions: citizens of Denver narrowly approved on-site usage in licensed clubs, and Pueblo, CO, voters rejected opponents’ efforts to pass what was essentially an industry shutdown. In both cases, cannabis supporters prevailed against the early betting. These votes show that experience with legalization can lead voters to pass even more open laws, and reject efforts to roll it back.

According to the England Journal of Medicine, 76% of clinicians polled worldwide believe that the medicinal benefits outweigh the risks and potential harms. Within the next five years, the legal cannabis industry is expected to out-earn the US film industry, the organic foods industry and more than triple the revenues of the NFL.

Marketing Focus and Strategy
 
Our marketing is centered around the Freedom Leaf magazine and website. It is a two-fold strategy. First, the magazine draws businesses that are in the cannabis/hemp industry to speak to us either because they are interested in advertising in the magazine and/or for Freedom Leaf to publicize their business either through us writing an article about their company or for them to write an article about an aspect in the industry that relates to their business (content marketing). Second, Freedom Leaf will undertake cross promotion with operators of different expos, seminars and other public events that extend our reach to companies in the industry. Last of all, we also use the non-profit alliances that we have established to gain a prominent position in our Industry. This has provided Freedom Leaf with considerable credibility and the ability to attract deals with companies to either represent them accelerate them or acquire them.

Target Market
 
The State of Colorado completed a survey for the year 2014 which provides helpful information on the demographics related to our target markets:
 

Competitive Edge
 
Freedom Leaf’s credibility has been growing in the cannabis/hemp marketplace due to its support of non-profits in the space and for the excellent editorial and other content in our magazine.
 
At least 50% of our magazine distribution is through non-profit activists (to themselves and those they come in contact with) and we believe, industry activists are among the most loyal consumers any company can potentially have. All of the magazine issues are also available on our Web site in addition to other content for viewers.
 
Its digest size (5.5” x 8.5”) is perfect for people to carry around easily.
 
Competitors
 
We compete with companies of all sizes in a variety of geographies that offer solutions that compete with elements of our business plan, such as in print and online printing, advertising, etc. More specifically, however, the medical and recreational marijuana companies are a new, developing and nascent market, resulting in a highly fragmented and fractured marketplace. The federal state and municipal governments have varying degrees of legality that will affect business. Some of the companies we compete with are much larger than us, and such companies have significantly greater resources.

Most of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer or user bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Our competitors may be able to secure experienced employees, accommodate customers more efficiently and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can. Many of these current and potential competitors can devote substantially more resources to advertising, marketing and attracting experienced talent than we can. In addition, larger, more well-established and financed entities may acquire, invest in or form joint ventures with our competitors

Government Regulations
 
We believe that we are and will continue to be in compliance in all material respects with applicable statutes and the regulations passed in the United States. There are no current orders or directions relating to our company with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations.
 
Continued development of the marijuana industry is dependent upon continued legislative authorization of marijuana at the state level. Any number of factors could slow or halt progress in this area. Further, progress, while encouraging, is not assured. While there may be ample public support for legislative action, numerous factors impact the legislative process. Any one of these factors could slow or halt use of marijuana, which would negatively impact our proposed business.
 
Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal laws. There are currently 25 states and the District of Columbia allowing its citizens to use Medical Marijuana. Additionally, Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington State, as well as Washington D.C., have voted to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use. The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. The Obama administration effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct law federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. However, the Trump administration has signaled that it may reverse Obama-era guidance, and the current administration may change the prior stated policy regarding the low-priority enforcement of federal marijuana laws. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus indirectly and adversely affect our revenues and profits. Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. While we do not intend to harvest, distribute or sell cannabis in the United States, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal government or state-level regulatory or legislative changes.
 
Environmental Regulations
 
We do not believe that we are or will become subject to any environmental laws or regulations of the United States. While our products and business activities do not currently violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our products or potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Employees
 
As of June 30, 2017, we had a total of six full time employees. Our employees are not parties to any collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relationships with our employees are good.
Property
 
We lease approximately 2,800 square feet of office space in Las Vegas, Nevada, pursuant to a lease that will expire on April 15, 2019. This facility serves as our corporate headquarters.
Available Information
 
All reports of the Company filed with the SEC are available free of charge through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
