  Industry Background of Cord
 
 The human body is comprised of many types of cells with individual characteristics and specific functions. Cells with a defined or specialized function are referred to as differentiated. Examples of differentiated cells include nerve cells, red blood cells and skin cells. Differentiated cells are replaced and renewed over time from a population of rare, undifferentiated cells known as stem cells. As stem cells grow and proliferate, they are capable of producing both additional stem cells as well as cells that have differentiated to perform a specific function. Stem cell differentiation is prompted by specific cell-to-cell interactions or other molecular signals. These signals trigger a change in the cell’s genetic profile, causing specific genes to become active and others to become inactive. As a result, the cell develops specialized structures, features and functions representative of its differentiated cell type.

 There are many types of stem cells in the human body. These stem cells are found in different concentrations and in different locations in the body during a person’s lifetime. Current thinking suggests that each organ and tissue in the body is founded, maintained and possibly rejuvenated to different degrees, on a more or less continual basis, by specific stem cell populations naturally present in the body. Types of stem cells include:
 
  Hematopoietic stem cells. Hematopoietic, or blood, stem cells reside in the bone marrow, umbilical cord and placenta. They can also be found in an infant’s umbilical cord as well as circulating in very small numbers in the blood. Hematopoietic stem cells generate all other blood and immune system cells in the body.
 
  Neural stem cells. Neural stem cells can be found in the brain and spinal cord and are capable of differentiating into nerve and brain tissue.
 
  Mesenchymal stem cells. Mesenchymal stem cells can be found in bone marrow, cord tissue and adipose tissue and differentiate into bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, tendon and other connective tissues.
 
  Pancreatic islet stem cells. Pancreatic islet stem cells can be found in the pancreas and differentiate into specialized cells of the pancreas including cells that secrete insulin.
 
 The ability of a stem cell to differentiate into multiple types of cells of a certain tissue is referred to as pluripotency. For example, a hematopoietic stem cell has the ability to differentiate into many types of blood and immune system cells. However, stem cells of one tissue type may also generate specialized cells of another tissue type, a characteristic referred to as plasticity. For example, under specific conditions, hematopoietic stem cells have been shown to generate specialized cells of other systems, including neural, endocrine, skeletal, respiratory and cardiac systems. These characteristics make stem cells highly flexible and useful for a number of applications, including the potential use as therapeutics.
 
  Cell therapy. Cell therapy is the use of live cells as therapeutic agents to treat disease. This therapy involves the introduction of cells to replace or initiate the production of other cells that are missing or damaged due to disease. Currently, the most common forms of cell therapy include blood and platelet transfusions and bone marrow transplants.
 
 Bone marrow transplantation is a medical procedure in which hematopoietic stem cells are introduced into the body in order to regenerate healthy, functioning bone marrow. In this procedure, stem cells are obtained from a donor through a surgical procedure to remove bone marrow. The donated bone marrow, including any “captured” stem cells, is then transfused into the patient. Stem cells for transplantation may also be obtained from peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood donations. Sometimes the stem cells used in the procedure are obtained from the patient’s own bone marrow or blood.
 
 Bone marrow transplantation has been successfully employed in the treatment of a variety of cancers and other serious diseases since the 1960s.
 
 The flexibility and plasticity of stem cells has led many researchers to believe that stem cells have tremendous promise in the treatment of diseases other than those currently addressed by stem cell procedures. Researchers have reported progress in the development of new therapies utilizing stem cells for the treatment of cancer, neurological, immunological, genetic, cardiac, pancreatic, liver and degenerative diseases.
 
  Umbilical Cord Blood Banking
 
 The success of current and emerging cell therapies is dependent on the presence of a rich and abundant source of stem cells. Umbilical cord blood has been emerging as an ideal source for these cells. As information about the potential therapeutic value of stem cells has entered the mainstream, and following the first successful cord blood transplant performed in 1988, cord blood collection has grown. In the past decades, multiple public and private cord blood banks have been established to provide for the collection and storage of these cells. Public cord blood banks collect and store umbilical cord blood donated by women at the birth of the child. This blood is stored and made available for a significant fee to an unrelated individual who matches the cord blood stored. The Company does not currently collect or store donated cord blood units. Private, or family cord blood banks such as Cord, collect and store umbilical cord blood on a fee-for-service basis for families. This blood is stored and made available to the family in the event the family needs stem cells for a transplant.

  Umbilical Cord Tissue Banking
 
 An emerging source of stem cells found in the umbilical cord tissue for therapeutic use are Mesenchymal stem cells.  Mesenchymal stem cells, which are abundant in the cord tissue, possess the ability to regenerate into connective tissues including nerves, bones, muscles and ligaments.  While there are currently no clinically approved use for these stem cells, there are clinical trials underway, and many scientists view this source of stem cells as promising resource in the field of regenerative medicine.  In more recent years, many of the private or family cord blood banks have begun offering cord tissue related processing and storage services on a fee-for-service basis for families.   Private cord blood banks typically offer to store a whole segment of the cord tissue, or a service where the Mesenchymal stem cells are isolated from the cord tissue, expanded, and then cryogenically stored.   Cord facilitates whole segment cord tissue processing and storage services.

  Material Reclassification, Merger, Consolidation, or Purchase or Sale of Significant Assets
  
  BioCells Acquisition
  
 In September 2010, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”), with the Shareholders of Biocordcell Argentina S.A., a corporation organized under the laws of Argentina (“Bio”), providing for the Company’s acquisition of 50.004% of the outstanding shares of Bio (the “Shares).
  
  

 
 Under the Agreement, the Company paid $375,000 in cash at the closing, and was obligated to pay an additional $350,000 in October, 2010, $150,000 of which is part of the fixed portion of the purchase price for the shares, for a total minimum purchase price of $525,000. The remaining $200,000 of this payment represents advances against the contingent payments due based on Bio’s 2010 and 2011 net income performances.
  
 The Agreement provides that the Shareholders are to be paid contingent “earn-out” compensation in 2011 based on achieving certain levels of net income in 2010 of which the Shareholders were paid $500,000. As of June 22, 2012, the Company entered into an Agreement with the shareholders of Bio from whom the Company purchased its majority ownership interest in Bio in 2010 (the "Sellers") relating to the 2011 earnout. Under the Agreement, the Company would pay the Sellers the following: $25,000 on or before June 30, 2012; $10,000 on or before July 31, 2012; and $25,000 on or before September 30, 2012, for a total cash payment of $60,000. In addition, the Sellers would collect the Company’s portion of BioCells shareholder dividends for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, up to a maximum amount of $440,000, if any. Also, if BioCells is sold before April 2014 and certain thresholds for purchase price and payment are met or exceeded, then the Sellers could receive additional compensation, specifically an amount which equals $705,000 minus any amounts paid pursuant to the cash payments and payments from the Company’s shareholder dividends, which are detailed above. That sum would be paid to the Sellers out of the proceeds of such a sale.  All amounts owed by the Company described above have been paid in full.
 
 On September 29, 2014, the Company closed a transaction whereby it sold its ownership stake in BioCells, amounting to 50.004% of the outstanding shares of BioCells to Diego Rissola (Purchaser), who is the current President and Chairman of the Board of BioCells and a shareholder prior to the transaction.
 
 Under the Agreement, the Purchaser is obligated to pay the total amount of $705,000, as follows:
 
 $5,000 on or before October 12, 2014; $10,000 on or before December 1, 2014; $15,000 on or before March 1, 2015; $15,000 on or before June 1, 2015; $45,000 on or before June 1, 2016; $55,000 on or before June 1, 2017; $55,000 on or before June 1, 2018; $55,000 on or before June 1, 2019; $65,000 on or before June 1, 2020; $75,000 on or before June 1, 2021; $75,000 on or before June 1, 2022; $75,000 on or before June 1, 2023; $80,000 on or before June 1, 2024; $80,000 on or before June 1, 2025.
 
 The Purchaser is current with the payment schedule as of December 31, 2016.
 
  VidaPlus
 
 On January 24, 2011, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire up to 51% of the capital stock in VidaPlus, an umbilical cord processing and storage company headquartered in Madrid, Spain. The Agreement is organized into three tranches; the first executed at closing with an initial investment of approximately $204,000 (150,000 Euro) for an amount equivalent to 7% as follows; 1% of share capital in initial equity or approximately $30,000 and 6% or an estimated $174,000 as a loan convertible into equity within 12 months of closing. The initial investment was secured by a Pledge Agreement on 270 VidaPlus samples that were incurring annual storage fees. The second tranche provided the opportunity for an additional 28% in share capital through monthly investments based on the number of samples processed in that month (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR). In connection with Tranche 2, the Company loaned VidaPlus $246,525. Converting the investment from a loan into equity was to take place within 24 months of the date the amount of shares due to the Company pursuant to the second tranche is calculated. According to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the third tranche follows a similar loan to equity agreement as tranche two but for an additional 16% equity at the option of the Company (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR).
 
 In connection with the VidaPlus Stock Purchase Agreement entered into on January 24, 2011, the Company was obligated to make monthly loans to VidaPlus based on the number of new samples processed and up to a maximum of 550,000 Euro for each of Tranche 2 and 3 of the Agreement. Tranche 2 did contain provisions that provided the Company an option to discontinue funding if certain performance targets were not met.
 
 In January 2012, the Company exercised its right to convert its Tranche 1 loan into 6% of the outstanding shares of VidaPlus, and as a result, the Company owned a total of 7% of the outstanding shares. At the time of the equity conversion, the Company no longer maintained its Pledge on the 270 VidaPlus samples associated with Tranche 1; however, the Company maintained a liquidation preference in VidaPlus over the money invested by the Company in VidaPlus. Additionally, the Company declined to make any further investment (loan or otherwise) to VidaPlus under either Tranche 2, Tranche 3 or otherwise. Pursuant to the Agreement, CBAI held a pledge over the umbilical cord blood maintenance and storage contracts between VidaPlus and certain of its customers, and all rights contained therein, including but not limited to the rights to administer those contracts and the rights to collect the revenues derived from those contracts, for 328 samples. CBAI held that pledge until such time as it converted the monies paid to VidaPlus under Tranche 2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement into equity into VidaPlus, in accordance with the formulas set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. CBAI was required to make that conversion within two years of when the calculation was made as to the amount of shares to which CBAI is entitled pursuant to Tranche 2, which meant that such conversion would take place around or before February 2014. CBAI also held a liquidation preference in VidaPlus for the money the Company invested in VidaPlus. On February 14, 2014, CBAI delivered to VidaPlus its election to convert its loan under Tranche 2 into shares of stock in VidaPlus, including Anti-Dilution shares.  The Company is entitled to an additional ownership stake of approximately 2.24% in connection with the forgoing, bringing its total ownership percentage to approximately 9.24%.

 The Company holds approximately 9.24% of the outstanding shares of VidaPlus, and has a balance of convertible loans receivable amounting to $246,525. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company reviewed the recoverability of the equity investment and loans receivable and the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the investment as a result of recurring and continued operating losses at VidaPlus. Fair value of the loans receivable is determined based on the discounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by assets pledged against the loans. The Company recorded an impairment of 100% of the book value of the equity investment and convertible loan receivable.
 
  Competition
  
 The Company is one of an estimated twenty-five (25) firms in the US providing private cord blood banking services, with approximately one half of those providing additional cord tissue related services.

 Patents, Trademarks, Licenses or Royalty Agreements.
  
  Patent License Agreement
  
 PharmaStem Therapeutics claimed to hold certain patents relating to the storage, expansion and use of hematopoietic stem cells. Previously, PharmaStem commenced suit against numerous companies involved in cord blood collection and preservation alleging infringement of its patents. In October 2003, after a jury trial, judgment was entered against certain of the Company’s competitors and in favor of PharmaStem in one of those suits. In February 2004, PharmaStem commenced suit against Cord Partners and certain of its competitors alleging infringement of its patents. Management of Cord Partners determined to settle, rather than to litigate, this matter. As a result, PharmaStem and Cord Partners entered into a Patent License Agreement in March 2004. Pursuant to the Patent License Agreement, Cord Partners could, on a non-exclusive basis, collect, process and store cord blood utilizing PharmaStem’s claimed technology and processes allegedly covered by its patents for so long as the patents may remain in effect. Most of the patents at issue expired in 2010. PharmaStem could claim, arguendo, Cord Partners is obligated under the Patent License Agreement to pay royalties to PharmaStem of 15% of all revenues generated by Cord Partners from the collection and storage of cord blood on and after January 1, 2004. Other than potential royalties, which would be disputed by Cord, no amount is payable by Cord Partners to PharmaStem. All litigation between the parties was dismissed and all prior claims were released. As of 2008, Cord ceased paying all royalties to PharmaStem. The patents have been declared void under a final decision on appeal, and as such, there is no pending litigation in this matter. As of December 31, 2014, the Company included approximately $226,000 in accounts payable and $120,000 included in accrued expenses to account for this liability since 2008, though the Company disputes that it owes any royalties to Pharmastem. As of September 30, 2015, and for fiscal year 2015, the Company made a one-time adjustment of the previously held amount of approximately $226,000 in accounts payable and $120,000 in accrued expenses, to its income statement as a gain on a settlement payable of $346,269.
