Our Business
 
General
 
Chembio Diagnostics develops, manufactures, and commercializes point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests that are used to detect or monitor diseases. All products that are currently being developed are based on the Company’s patented DPP® technology, a novel point-of-care diagnostic platform that offers certain customer advantages as compared to traditional lateral flow technology. POC tests, by providing prompt and early diagnosis, can reduce patient stays, lower overall costs, improve therapeutic interventions and improve patient outcomes.  POC tests can also prevent needless hospital admissions, simplify testing procedures, avoid delays from central lab batching, and eliminate the need for return visits.
 
Our product commercialization and product development efforts are focused in three areas: sexually transmitted disease, tropical & fever disease, and technology collaborations. In sexually transmitted disease, we are commercializing tests for HIV and Syphilis. In tropical and fever disease, we are commercializing tests for Zika virus, dengue virus, and chikungunya virus, and developing tests for malaria, ebola, lassa, Marburg, leptospirosis, Rickettsia typhi, Burkholderia pseudomallei, and Orientia tsutsugamushi, individually or as part of a fever panel test. Through technology collaborations, we are developing tests for a specific form of cancer, concussion, bovine tuberculosis, and for an undisclosed biomarker, the latter in collaboration with global biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.

DPP® Technology & Development
 
The Company’s commercially available products employ either our patented Dual Path Platform (DPP®) technology or traditional lateral flow technology. We believe products developed using the Company’s DPP® technology can provide superior diagnostic performance compared with products that utilize traditional lateral flow technology. 
 
Chembio is executing its strategy to leverage the DPP® intellectual property, as well as the Company’s scientific and operational expertise, to create new collaborations where Chembio will serve as an exclusive development and manufacturing partner. Examples of such collaborations include the following:
 
 
● | In October 2014, we entered into an agreement with an international diagnostics company to develop a POC diagnostic test for the early detection and monitoring of a specific type of cancer. At that time, the cancer project represented the first application of the DPP® technology outside the infectious disease field.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In January 2015, we entered into an agreement with the Concussion Science Group (CSG) Division of Perseus Science Group LLC to utilize our DPP® technology to develop a POC diagnostic test for traumatic brain injury (TBI), including sports-related concussions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In January 2015, we were awarded a grant from The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to expedite the feasibility testing and development of a DPP® Malaria POC rapid diagnostic to accurately identify individuals infected with Plasmodium falciparum parasite.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In October 2015, we were awarded a grant from The Paul G. Allen Family Foundation to develop a POC test to identify multiple life-threatening febrile illnesses. Under the $2.1 million dollar grant, we used our DPP® technology to develop a DPP® Fever Panel Assay, a POC multiplex assay to simultaneously detect Malaria, Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, Ebola, Lassa and Marburg.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In October 2015, we signed an agreement with opTricon (Berlin, Germany), a leading developer of mobile analysis devices for rapid diagnostic tests. The DPP® Micro Reader provides customers with various options to capture, record, transmit and store test results. With one-button operation, the palm-sized and battery-operated DPP® Micro Reader is simple, fast, portable, and cost-effective.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In October 2017, we signed a development agreement with AstraZeneca for the development of a quantitative point-of-care assay for a novel biomarker based on our DPP® assay and DPP® Micro Reader technologies.

We believe our scientific capabilities and proprietary know-how relating to our patented DPP® technology and lateral flow technology are very strong, particularly for the development and manufacture of tests for the detection of antibodies to infectious diseases such as sexually transmitted diseases, fever and tropical diseases, and other diseases.
 
Our ability to develop and market other products is in large measure dependent on our having additional resources and/or collaborative relationships.  Some of our product development efforts have been funded on a project or milestone basis.  We believe that our proprietary know-how relating to our patented DPP® technology has been instrumental in our obtaining the collaborations we have and that we continue to pursue.  We believe that our patent protection enhances our ability to both develop more profitable, collaborative relationships and expand licensing revenue. However, there are a number of competitive technologies used and/or seeking to be used by others in point-of-care settings.
 
Although we have no specific knowledge of any other competitors’ products that could render our products obsolete, if we fail to maintain and enhance our competitive position or fail to introduce new products and product features, our customers may decide to use the products developed by our competitors, which could result in a loss of revenues and cash flow.
 
Research and Development
 
During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we spent $8.6 million, $8.4 million and $6.4 million, respectively, on research and development (including regulatory activities).  These expenses were in part funded by R&D milestone and grant revenues of $4.0 million in 2017, $3.7 million in 2016 and $2.3 million in 2015.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 165 people.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
Certain of our activities are subject to regulatory oversight by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing, and export of diagnostic products. Our clinical laboratory is subject to oversight by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) pursuant to CLIA (defined below), as well as agencies in various states. Failure to comply with applicable requirements can lead to sanctions, including withdrawal of products from the market, recalls, refusal to authorize government contracts, product seizures, civil money penalties, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.
 
FDA Approval/Clearance Requirements
 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we market or wish to market in the U.S. must receive 510(k) clearance or Premarket Approval, or “PMA.” Medical devices that receive 510(k) clearance are “cleared” by the FDA to market, distribute, and sell in the United States. Medical devices that obtain a PMA by the FDA are “approved” to market, distribute, and sell in the United States. We cannot be sure that 510(k) clearance or PMA approval will ever be obtained for any products that have not already obtained 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. Descriptions of the PMA and 510(k) clearance processes are provided below.
 
The FDA decides whether a device line must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or PMA based on statutory criteria that utilize a risk-based classification system. PMA is the FDA process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices and, in many cases, Class II medical devices. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The FDA uses these criteria to decide whether a PMA or a 510(k) is appropriate, including the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination by the agency of whether the product is a type of device that is similar to devices that are already legally marketed. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either Class I or II. In many cases, the FDA requires the manufacturer to submit a 510(k) requesting clearance (also referred to as a premarket notification), unless an exemption applies. The 510(k) must demonstrate that the manufacturer’s proposed device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a legally marketed predicate device. A “predicate device” is a pre-existing medical device to which equivalence can be drawn, that is either in Class I, Class II, or is a Class III device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of a PMA application.
 
Device classification depends on the device’s intended use and its indications for use. In addition, classification is risk-based, that is, the risk the device poses to the patient and/or the user is a major factor in determining the class to which it is assigned. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk and Class III includes those with the greatest risk.
 
Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s general regulatory controls for medical devices, or the General Controls, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s quality system regulations, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) process described below.
 
Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) process. Pursuant to the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA), as of October 2002, unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) submissions are subject to user fees. Certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process.
  
Class III includes devices with the greatest risk. Devices in this class must meet all of the requirements in Classes I and II. In addition, Class III devices cannot be marketed until they receive Premarket Approval.
 The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by the General Controls and the other requirements described above. These devices require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Under MDUFMA, PMA applications (and supplemental premarket approval applications) are subject to significantly higher user fees than 510(k) applications, and they also require considerably more time and resources.
 
Rapid HIV tests intended for diagnostic use are regulated as Class III devices. Responsibility for assuring the safety and effectiveness of these tests lies within the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research’s Office of Blood Research and Review, with oversight by the Blood Products Advisory Committee (BPAC). Approved Rapid HIV tests must meet the regulations in the 21 CFR 800 series subparts, under the Investigational Device exemption (IDE) and PMA pathways.

Premarket Approval Pathway
 
We manufacture, market, and distribute three rapid HIV tests in the U.S: our HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK® Assay, SURE CHECK® HIV 1/2 Assay, and DPP® HIV 1/2 Assay, all of which have received FDA PMA approval. A PMA application must be submitted if a device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, analytical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing, statutory preapproval inspections, and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. Before a PMA is submitted, a manufacturer must apply for an investigational device exemption, or “IDE.” If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the FDA requires the device sponsor to file an IDE application with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to initiation of enrollment of human subjects for clinical trials. The IDE provides the manufacturer with a legal pathway to perform clinical trials on human subjects where without the IDE, only approved medical devices may be used on human subjects.
 
The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as analytical, animal and laboratory testing results, manufacturing information, and an Investigational Review Board (IRB) approved protocol showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. If the clinical trial design is deemed to have “non-significant risk,” the clinical trial may be eligible for “abbreviated” IDE requirements; and, in some instances, IVD clinical trials may be exempt from the more burdensome IDE requirements if certain labeling requirements are met.
 
A clinical trial may be suspended by either the FDA or the IRB at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the study. Even if a study is completed, clinical testing results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, or they may be equivocal or otherwise insufficient to obtain approval of the product being tested. After the clinical trials have been completed, if at all, and the clinical trial data and results are collected and organized, a manufacturer may complete a PMA application.
 
After a PMA application is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the “accepted application,” although, generally, review of the application can take between one and three years, but it may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The preapproval inspections conducted by the FDA include an evaluation of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality Systems Regulations (QSR), as well as inspections of the clinical trial sites by the Bioresearch Monitoring group to evaluate compliance with good clinical practice and human subject protections. New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. Significant changes to an approved PMA require a 180-day supplement, whereas less substantive changes may utilize a 30-day notice, or a 135-day supplement. Premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application, and it may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
 
Our HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK® Assay PMA application number BP050009/0 and our SURE CHECK® 1/2 HIV Assay PMA application number BP050010/0 were approved by the FDA on May 25, 2006. Our DPP® HIV 1/2 Assay PMA application number BP120032/0 was approved by the FDA on December 19, 2012.
 
510(k) Clearance Pathway
 
We do not currently market, distribute, or sell a product that has market clearance by the FDA. However, we are currently developing products that either will or are likely to require an FDA 510(k) clearance, and we anticipate submitting a 510(k) for each such product to demonstrate that such proposed device is substantially equivalent to a respective previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of 510(k). FDA's 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months but could take longer. In some cases the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
 
If a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, a PMA. The FDA requires each device manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a new 510(k) or a PMA, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA of the modified device is obtained.
 
If the FDA requires us to submit a new 510(k) or PMA for any modifications to a previously cleared product, or if we obtain 510(k) clearance for a device in the future, we may be required to submit a separate new 510(k) or PMA application for such modifications.
 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA)
 
A manufacturer of a test categorized as moderately complex may request that categorization of the test as waived through a CLIA Waiver by Application (CW) submission to the FDA. When a test is categorized as waived, it may be performed by laboratories with a Certificate of Waiver, such as a physician’s office outreach setting. In a CW submission, the manufacturer provides evidence to the FDA that a test meets the CLIA statutory criteria for waiver, 42 U.S.C. 263a(d)(3). Congress passed CLIA in 1988, which provided CMS authority over all laboratory testing, except research that is performed on humans in the United States. The Division of Laboratory Services, within the Survey and Certification Group, under the CMS, has the responsibility for implementing the CLIA program.
 
The CLIA program is designed to establish quality laboratory testing by ensuring the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results. Under CLIA, a laboratory is a facility that does laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans and used to provide information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or impairment of, or assessment of health. Under the CLIA program, unless waived, laboratories must be certified by the government, satisfy governmental quality and personnel standards, undergo proficiency testing, be subject to inspections and pay fees. We have received a CLIA waiver for both of our lateral flow rapid HIV tests that we market in the U.S. Specifically, the CLIA waiver was granted by the FDA for HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK® on November 20, 2006 and for SURE CHECK® HIV 1/2 on October 22, 2007. In 2008 the FDA revised its CLIA waiver requirements so that an additional prospective trial is required in order to demonstrate clinical utility by showing that the device is capable of identifying new infections when used by untrained users. Our DPP® HIV 1/2 test received a CLIA waiver under these newer requirements on October 29, 2014.

 Our Medford, New York facility is currently registered as an establishment with the FDA. We and any third-party manufacturers are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with quality system regulation and other regulations.
 
21st Century Cures Act
 
The 21st Century Cures Act, enacted in December 2016, contains several sections specific to medical device innovations. The Company believes that implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act may have a positive impact on its businesses by facilitating innovation and/or reducing the regulatory burden imposed on medical device manufacturers.
Government Regulation of Medical Devices for Animal Subjects
 
We currently sell, market, or distribute two veterinary devices in the United States: DPP® VetTB Assay for Cervids and DPP® VetTB Assay for Elephants. Diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases, including our veterinary devices for the prevention and/or treatment of animal disease, are regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics within the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) under the Virus, Serum, and Toxin Act of 1913. As a requirement, our veterinary devices were approved by APHIS before they could be sold in the U.S.
 
The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation. Following regulatory approval to market a product, APHIS requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers. In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for government-mandated disease management programs.
 
Environmental Laws
 
To date, we have not encountered any costs relating to compliance with any environmental laws.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Intellectual Property Strategy
 
Our intellectual property strategy is to:  (1) build our own intellectual property portfolio around our DPP® technology; (2) pursue licenses, trade secrets and know-how within the area of rapid point-of-care testing; and, (3) develop and acquire proprietary positions to certain reagents.

DPP® Intellectual Property
 
We have obtained patent coverage on our DPP® technology, including numerous patents in the United States, China, Malaysia, Eurasia, Mexico, Singapore, Japan, Australia, Indonesia, Korea and the U.K.  Additional patent applications on our DPP® technology are pending in the U.S., as well as in many foreign countries such as Brazil, Canada, the European Union, India, Israel, and South Africa. 
 
The DPP® technology provides us with our own intellectual property. We believe it provides us with freedom to operate, which enables us to develop tests with better performance and unmatched capabilities compared with tests built on traditional lateral flow platforms.  These advantages have allowed us to enter into multiple technology collaborations based upon the DPP® technology, which we believe will provide new manufacturing and marketing opportunities. We have filed other patent applications that we believe will strengthen the DPP® intellectual property and have also filed for patent protection for certain other point-of-care technologies or applications thereof.
 
Trademarks
 
We have filed and obtained trademarks for our products, including DPP®, SURE CHECK®, STAT-VIEW®, and STAT-PAK®, as well as for the SampleTainer®, which is used with certain DPP® products.  Our trademarks have been obtained in the United States and certain other countries around the world.
 
Trade Secrets and Know-How
 
We have developed a substantial body of trade secrets and know-how relating to the development and manufacture of lateral flow and DPP®-based diagnostic tests, including but not limited to the sourcing and optimization of materials for such tests, and methods to maximize sensitivity, speed-to-result, specificity, stability and reproducibility of our tests.  We possess proprietary know-how to develop tests for multiple conditions using colored particles.  Our formulations enable long shelf lives of our rapid HIV and other tests, providing us with an important competitive advantage.
 
Lateral Flow Technology and Reagent Licenses
 
As of February 3, 2015 the royalty expenses related to certain lateral flow technology expired. These now allow us to produce STAT-PAK®, SURE CHECK®, STAT-VIEW®, DIPSTICK®, and veterinary product lines free of those royalties.
 
Although we believe our DPP® IP is outside of the scope of all lateral flow patents of which we are aware, we consult with patent counsel, and seek licenses and/or redesigns of products that we believe to be in our best interests.  Because of the costs and other negative consequences of time-consuming patent litigation, we often attempt to obtain a license on reasonable terms.  Nevertheless, there is no assurance that the Alere lateral flow patents we have licensed will not be challenged or that other patents containing claims relevant to our lateral flow or DPP® products will not be granted to third parties and that licenses to such patents, will be available on reasonable terms, if any. 
 
The peptides used in our rapid HIV tests were licensed to us by one or more third parties. We also have licensed the antigens used in other tests including our Syphilis, Tuberculosis, Leptospirosis, Leishmaniasis and Chagas tests, and we may enter other license agreements.  In prior years, we concluded license agreements related to intellectual property rights owned by the United States associated with HIV-1, and, during the first quarter of 2008, we entered into a sub-license agreement for HIV-2 with Bio-Rad Laboratories N.A., the exclusive licensee of the Pasteur Institute's HIV-2 intellectual property estate.


Corporate Information
 
We are a Nevada corporation that was formed in December 1985. Since inception, we have been involved in developing, manufacturing, selling and distributing medical diagnostic tests, including rapid tests that detect a number of diseases and other conditions in humans and animals.
Stockholder Rights Agreement
 
On March 8, 2016, we entered into a Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") between us and Action Stock Transfer Corp., as Rights Agent.  Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, we declared a dividend distribution of one Preferred Share Purchase Right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of our common stock, par value $0.01 (the "Common Stock"), in the manner described below. The Board of Directors set the payment date for the distribution of the Rights as March 8, 2016, and the Rights were distributed to our shareholders of record on that date.  The Rights Agreement also provides that Rights are issued with respect to any shares of our common stock that are newly issued after March 8, 2016, such as with respect to the Company's underwritten public offering in February 2018.  The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement.
Rights Initially Not Exercisable
 
The Rights are not exercisable until a Distribution Date.  Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, has no rights as a shareholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
 
Separation and Distribution of Rights
 
The Rights are to be evidenced by the certificates for shares of Common Stock registered in the names of the holders thereof, and not by separate rights certificates until the earlier to occur of (i) the close of business on the tenth business day following a public announcement that an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) has acquired a Combined Ownership (as defined in the Rights Agreement) of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock (the "Shares Acquisition Date") or (ii) the later of (A) the close of business on the tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to such time as any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person) after the date that a tender or exchange offer or intention to commence a tender or exchange offer by any person is first published, announced, sent or given within the meaning of Rule 14d-4(A) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the consummation of which would result in any person having Combined Ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock, or (B) if such a tender or exchange offer has been published, announced, sent or given before the date of the Rights Agreement, then the close of business on the tenth business day after the date the Rights Agreement was entered into (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to such time as any person becomes an Acquiring Person); (the earlier of such dates referred to in (i) and (ii), which date may include any such date that is after the date of the Rights Agreement but prior to the issuance of the Rights, being called the "Distribution Date").

ALGORITHM (parallel or serial) | For rapid HIV testing, this refers both to method or protocol (in developing countries to date) for using rapid tests from different manufacturers in combination to screen and confirm patients at the point-of-care, and may also refer to the specific tests that have been selected by an agency or ministry of health to be used in this way. A parallel algorithm uses two screening tests from different manufacturers and a tie-breaker test only if there is a discrepancy between the screening tests results. A serial algorithm only uses a second confirmatory test if there is a positive result from the screening test, meaning that the number of confirmatory tests used is equal to the positivity rate in the testing venue. A tie-breaker test resolves discrepancies between the screen and the confirmatory test. 
ANTIBODY | A protein which is a natural part of the human immune system produced by specialized cells to neutralize antigens, including viruses and bacteria that invade the body. Each antibody-producing cell manufactures a unique antibody that is directed against, binds to and eliminates one, and only one, specific type of antigen. 
ANTIGEN | Any substance which, upon entering the body, stimulates the immune system leading to the formation of antibodies. Among the more common antigens are bacteria, pollens, toxins, and viruses. 
ANVISA | The National Health Surveillance Agency of Brazil. 
ARVs | Anti-retroviral medications developed to fight AIDS. 
CDC | United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
CLIA waiver | Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act designation that allows simple tests to be performed in point-of-care settings such as doctor’s offices, walk-in clinics and emergency rooms. 
DIAGNOSTIC | Pertaining to the determination of the nature or cause of a disease or condition. Also refers to reagents or procedures used in diagnosis to measure proteins in a clinical sample. 
FIOCRUZ | The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation of Brazil. 
FDA | United States Food and Drug Administration. 
IgG | IgG or Immunoglobulin are proteins found in human blood. This protein is called an “antibody” and is an important part of the body’s defense against disease. When the body is attacked by harmful bacteria or viruses, antibodies help fight these invaders. 
IgM | IgM or Immunoglobulin M are proteins found in human blood. This protein is called an "antibody" and is an important part of the body's defense against disease. When the body is attacked by harmful bacteria or viruses, antibodies help fight these invaders.
