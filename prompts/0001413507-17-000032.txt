ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Synergy Resources Corporation ("we," "us," "Synergy," or the "Company") is a growth-oriented independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, and production of oil and natural gas in the Denver-Julesburg Basin (“D-J Basin”), which we believe to be one of the premier, liquids-rich oil and natural gas resource plays in the United States. The D-J Basin generally extends from the Denver metropolitan area throughout northeast Colorado into Wyoming, Nebraska, and Kansas. It contains hydrocarbon-bearing deposits in several formations, including the Niobrara, Codell, Greenhorn, Shannon, Sussex, J-Sand, and D-Sand. The area has produced oil and natural gas for over fifty years and benefits from established infrastructure including midstream and refining capacity, long reserve life, and multiple service providers.
Our drilling and completion activities are focused in the Wattenberg Field, predominantly in Weld County, Colorado, an area that covers the western flank of the D-J Basin. Currently, we are focused on the horizontal development of the Codell and Niobrara formations, which are characterized by relatively high liquids content. 
In order to maintain operational focus while preserving developmental flexibility, we strive to attain operational control of a majority of the wells in which we have a working interest. We currently operate approximately 73% of our proved producing reserves, and anticipate operating substantially all of our future net drilling locations. Our current development plan anticipates that all of our future activities will be concentrated in the Wattenberg Field.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we continued to execute our plans for growth through development of our existing oil and gas properties and strategic acquisitions of leasehold and producing properties. As of December 31, 2016, we are the operator of 324 gross (288 net) producing wells, of which 110 gross (106 net) are Codell or Niobrara horizontal wells. The Company has also participated as a non-operator in 307 gross (65 net) producing wells. In addition, there were 49 gross (44 net) operated wells in various stages of drilling or completion as of December 31, 2016, which excludes 9 gross (9 net) wells for which we have only set surface casings. 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our average net daily production was 11,670 BOED and 9,548 BOED, respectively. By comparison, during the years ended August 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our average production rate was 8,750 BOED, 4,290 BOED, and 2,117 BOED, respectively. By the end of December 31, 2016, over 96% of our daily operated production was from horizontal wells.
Strategy
Our primary objective is to enhance shareholder value by increasing our net asset value, net reserves, and cash flow through development, exploitation, exploration, and acquisitions of oil and gas properties. We intend to follow a balanced risk strategy by allocating capital expenditures to lower risk development and exploitation activities. Key elements of our business strategy include the following:

• | Concentrate on our existing core area in the D-J Basin, where we have significant operating experience. All of our current wells and our proved undeveloped acreage is located either in or adjacent to the Wattenberg Field. Focusing our operations in this area leverages our management, technical, and operational experience in the basin. 


• | Develop and exploit existing oil and gas properties. Our principal growth strategy has been to develop and exploit our properties to add reserves. In the Wattenberg Field, we target three benches of the Niobrara formation as well as the Codell formation for horizontal drilling and production. We believe horizontal drilling is the most efficient way to recover the potential hydrocarbons and consider the Wattenberg Field to be relatively low-risk because information gained from the large number of existing wells can be applied to potential future wells. There is enough similarity between wells in the Wattenberg Field that the exploitation process is generally repeatable. 


• | Improve hydrocarbon recovery through increased well density. We utilize what we believe to be industry best practices in our effort to determine the optimal recovery area for each well. Early horizontal well development in the Wattenberg Field generally assumed optimal recoveries would be obtained utilizing between 12 and 16 wells per 640-acre section. As horizontal well development has matured, well density assumptions have generally increased beyond 16 wells per section depending on the specific area of the field being drilled. 


• | Complete selective acquisitions. We seek to acquire developed and undeveloped oil and gas properties, primarily in the Wattenberg Field. We generally seek acquisitions that will provide us with opportunities for reserve additions and 

2

increased cash flow through production enhancement and additional development and exploratory prospect generation.


• | Retain control over the operation of a substantial portion of our production. As operator of a majority of our wells and undeveloped acreage, we control the timing and selection of new wells to be drilled. This allows us to modify our capital spending as our financial resources and underlying lease terms allow and market conditions permit. 


• | Maintain financial flexibility while focusing on operational cost control. We strive to be a cost-efficient operator and to maintain a relatively low utilization of debt, which enhances our financial flexibility. Our high degree of operational control, as well as our focus on operating efficiencies and short return on investment cycle times, is central to our operating strategy. 


• | Use the latest technology to maximize returns. Our development objective for individual well optimization is to drill and complete wells with lateral lengths of 7,000' to 10,000' as opposed to the 4,000' laterals that were initially drilled in the Wattenberg Field. Utilizing petrophysical and seismic data, a 3-D model is developed for each leasehold section to assist in determining optimal wellbore placement, well spacing, and stimulation design. This process is augmented with formation-specific drilling and completion execution designs and coupled with localized production results to provide a continuous improvement philosophy in optimizing the value per acre of our leasehold throughout our development program. 

Competitive Strengths

We believe that we are positioned to successfully execute our business strategy because of the following competitive strengths:

• | Core acreage position in the Wattenberg Field. Wells in our core properties in the Wattenberg Field generally exhibit high liquids content, and those properties are generally prospective for Niobrara A, B, and C bench and Codell development. We believe that these factors will lead to attractive EURs per acres of leasehold, per unit capital and operating costs, and rates of return. Increased well density within the Codell and Niobrara formations, as well as our acquisition efforts and organic leasing efforts within the core Wattenberg Field, have added to our multi-year drilling inventory. 


• | Financial flexibility. Our capital structure, along with our high degree of operational control, continues to provide us with significant financial flexibility. We have historically utilized very little debt in our capital structure. Our low debt level has enabled us to make capital decisions with limited restrictions imposed by debt covenants, lender oversight, and/or mandatory repayment schedules. Additionally, as the operator of substantially all of our anticipated future drilling locations per our December 31, 2016 reserve report, we control the timing and selection of drilling locations as well as completion schedules. This allows us to modify our capital spending program depending on financial resources, leasehold requirements, and market conditions. 


• | Management experience. Members of our key management team possess an average of over thirty years of experience in oil and gas exploration and production in multiple resource plays including the Wattenberg Field. 


• | Balanced oil and natural gas reserves and production. At December 31, 2016, approximately 73% of total gross revenues were oil and condensate, and 27% were natural gas. We believe that this balanced commodity mix will provide diversification of sources of cash flow. 


• | Cost-efficient and safe operator. We have continued to demonstrate our ability to drill wells in a cost-efficient and safe way and to successfully integrate acquired assets without incurring significant increases in overhead. 


• | High success rate. We have concentrated our drilling in areas that we perceive as relatively low risk and, as a result, have had a very high success rate in our drilling program throughout the Wattenberg Field. 

Properties
As of December 31, 2016, our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves, as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firm Ryder Scott Company, L.P. ("Ryder Scott"), were 38.0 MMBbls of oil and condensate and 331.9 Bcf of natural gas. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 397,200 gross and 332,400 net acres under lease. We further delineate our acreage into specific areas, including the areas that we refer to as the Wattenberg Field (approximately 78,500 gross and 68,900 net acres) and the North East Extension Area (approximately 55,300 gross and 27,600 net acres). In addition, we hold approximately
3

183,600 gross (180,400 net) acres in southwest Nebraska, a conventional oil-prone prospect, and approximately 77,900 gross (54,200 net) acres in other areas of Colorado.
We currently operate over 73% of our proved producing reserves, and over 98% of our drilling and completion expenditures during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were focused on the Wattenberg Field. Substantially all of our drilling and completion expenditures for the 2017 calendar year are anticipated to be focused on the Wattenberg Field. A high degree of operational and capital control gives us both operational focus and development flexibility to maximize returns on our leasehold position.
Significant Business Developments
Acquisitions
In May 2016, the Company entered into an agreement ("GC Agreement") to purchase a total of approximately 72,000 gross (33,100 net) acres located in an area known as the Greeley-Crescent development area in Weld County Colorado, primarily in and around the city of Greeley, for $505 million ("GC Acquisition"). Estimated net daily production from the acquired properties was approximately 2,400 BOE at the time we entered into the agreement. On June 14, 2016, the Company closed on the portion of the assets comprised of the undeveloped lands and non-operated production. The effective date of this part of the transaction was April 1, 2016, and the purchase price was $486.4 million, comprised of $485.1 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. The second closing will cover the operated producing properties and is expected to be completed in 2017. The Company has placed $18.2 million in escrow to be released upon the second closing. For the second closing, the effective date will be April 1, 2016 for the horizontal wells to be acquired and the first day of the calendar month in which the closing for such properties occurs for the vertical wells. The second closing is subject to certain closing conditions including the receipt of regulatory approval. Accordingly, the second closing of the transaction may not close in the expected time frame or at all.
During 2016, the Company completed various other acquisitions of undeveloped oil and natural gas leasehold interests in the D-J Basin for a total of $20.7 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities or receivables. These acquisitions were completed in an effort to increase our working interests and to extend the lateral lengths of our wells. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion.
Divestitures
In April 2016, the Company agreed to divest approximately 3,700 net undeveloped acres primarily in Adams County, Colorado and 107 vertical wells primarily in Weld County, Colorado for total consideration of approximately $24.7 million in cash and the assumption by the buyers of $0.5 million in liabilities. The divested assets had associated production of approximately 200 BOED at the time of sale. The vertical well transaction closed in April 2016 and the undeveloped acreage transaction closed in June 2016.
In January 2017, we executed a purchase and sale agreement with a private party resulting in the divestiture of acreage outside of the Company's core development area. The transaction resulted in the Company divesting approximately 10,000 net undeveloped acres and approximately 700 BOED of associated production for $71 million. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.
Equity offerings
In January 2016, the Company closed on the sale of 16,100,000 shares of common stock pursuant to an underwriting agreement with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, acting severally on behalf of itself and the other underwriters.  The price to the Company was $5.545 per share, and net proceeds to the Company, after deduction of underwriting discounts and expenses payable by the Company, were $89.2 million. Proceeds were used to repay amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, which included continuing to develop our acreage position in the Wattenberg Field and funding a portion of our 2016 capital expenditure program.
In April 2016, the Company closed on the sale of an additional 22,425,000 shares of common stock pursuant to an underwriting agreement with substantially the same underwriting group.  The price to the Company was $7.3535 per share, and net proceeds to the Company, after deduction of underwriting discounts and expenses payable by the Company, were $164.8 million.  The proceeds of this offering were used for general corporate purposes, including to fund the GC Acquisition.
In May and June 2016, the Company closed on the sale of an additional 51,750,000 shares of common stock pursuant to an underwriting agreement with substantially the same underwriting group.  The price to the Company was $5.597 per share, and 
4

net proceeds to the Company, after deduction of underwriting discounts and expenses payable by the Company, were $289.4 million. The proceeds of this offering were used for general corporate purposes, including to fund the GC Acquisition.
Revolving Credit Facility
We continue to maintain a borrowing arrangement with our bank syndicate to provide us with liquidity, which could be used to develop oil and gas properties, acquire new oil and gas properties, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2016, this revolving credit facility (sometimes referred to as the "Revolver") provides for maximum borrowings of $500 million, subject to adjustments based upon a borrowing base calculation, which is redetermined semi-annually using updated reserve reports. The Revolver is collateralized by certain of our assets, including substantially all of our producing wells and developed oil and gas leases, and bears a variable interest rate on borrowings with the effective rate varying with utilization. The Revolver expires on December 15, 2019. See further discussion in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements
In October 2016, the Revolver was amended in connection with the semi-annual redetermination of the borrowing base. The borrowing base was increased from $145 million to $160 million. Due to outstanding letters of credit, approximately $159.5 million of the borrowing base was available to use for future borrowings as of December 31, 2016.
The Revolver contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the payment of dividends and limit our overall commodity derivative position to a maximum position that varies over 5 years as a percentage of estimated proved reserves as projected in the semi-annual reserve report.
The Revolver also requires the Company to maintain compliance with certain financial and liquidity ratio covenants. Under the requirements, the Company, on a quarterly basis, must not (a) at any time permit its ratio of total funded debt as of such time to EBITDAX, as defined in the agreement, to be greater than or equal to 4.0 to 1.0; or (b) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter permit its current ratio, as defined in the agreement, to be less than 1.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2016, the most recent compliance date, the Company was in compliance with these covenants and expects to remain in compliance throughout the next 12-month period.
Senior Notes
In June 2016, the Company issued $80 million aggregate principal amount of 9% Senior Notes ("Senior Notes") in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. The maturity for the payment of principal is June 13, 2021. Interest on the Senior Notes accrues at 9% and began accruing on June 14, 2016. Interest is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2016. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of June 14, 2016 (the "Indenture") and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries that incur or guarantee certain indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Revolver. The net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were $75.2 million after deductions of $4.8 million for expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions. The net proceeds were used to fund the GC Acquisition. The Indenture contains covenants that restrict the Company’s ability and the ability of certain of its subsidiaries to, among other restrictions and limitations: (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) incur liens; (iii) pay dividends; (iv) consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of its or their assets; (v) engage in transactions with affiliates; or (vi) engage in certain restricted business activities.  These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications.

Drilling and Completion Operations
During the periods presented below, we drilled or participated in the drilling of a number of wells that reached productive status in each respective period.  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we completed 24 wells in two separate spacing units. Due to proved well density thresholds, 6 of the wells are classified as exploratory and 18 of the wells are classified as development.

All of the oil wells in the table above are located in, or adjacent to, the Wattenberg Field of the D-J Basin. The three natural gas wells in the table above are located in Yuma County, Colorado. As of December 31, 2016, we were the operator of 49 gross (44 net) wells in progress, which excludes 9 gross (9 net) wells for which we have only set surface casings, that were not included in the above well counts.

Major Customers
Historically, we sold our oil production to local refineries and, to a lesser degree, third-party marketers. During 2014, we secured contracts with additional oil purchasers who transport oil via pipelines. Under the contracts, we have delivery commitments covering a portion of our anticipated future production over the next four to five years. Our natural gas is sold under contracts with two midstream gas gathering and processing companies. We believe that both gas processing and oil takeaway capacity are sufficient to meet our anticipated production growth. See further discussion in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
Oil and Gas Properties, Wells, Operations, and Acreage
We believe that the title to our oil and gas properties is good and defensible in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry, subject to such exceptions which, in our opinion, are not so material as to detract substantially from the use or value of such properties. Our properties are typically subject, in one degree or another, to one or more of the following:

• | royalties and other burdens and obligations, expressed or implied, under oil and gas leases;


• | overriding royalties and other burdens created by us or our predecessors in title;


• | a variety of contractual obligations (including, in some cases, development obligations) arising under operating agreements, farm-out agreements, production sales contracts, and other agreements that may affect the properties or title thereto;


• | back-ins and reversionary interests existing as a result of pooling under state orders;


• | liens that arise in the normal course of operations, such as those for unpaid taxes, statutory liens securing obligations to unpaid suppliers and contractors, and contractual liens under operating agreements;


• | pooling, unitization and communitization agreements, declarations, and orders; and


• | easements, restrictions, rights-of-way, and other matters that commonly affect property.

To the extent that such burdens and obligations affect our rights to production revenues, they have been taken into account in calculating our net revenue interests and in estimating the size and value of our reserves. We believe that the burdens and obligations affecting our properties are customary in the industry for properties of the kind that we own.
The following table shows, as of December 31, 2016, by state, our producing wells, developed acreage, and undeveloped acreage:

 | Productive Wells | Developed Acreage | | Undeveloped Acreage 1
State | Gross | Net | | Gross | Net | Gross | | Net
Colorado | 631 | | 353 | | 26,500 | | 22,000 | | 185,200 | 128,700
Nebraska | — | | — | | — | | — | | 183,600 | 180,400
Wyoming | — | | — | | — | | — | | 1,100 | 500 
Kansas | — | | — | | — | | — | | 800 | 800 
Total | 631 | | 353 | | 26,500 | | 22,000 | | 370,700 | 310,400

  1    Undeveloped acreage includes leasehold interests on which wells have not been drilled or completed to the point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether the leasehold interest is classified as containing proved undeveloped reserves.
    The following table shows, as of December 31, 2016, the status of our gross acreage:

State | Held by Production | Not Held by Production
Colorado | 62,100 | | 149,600
Nebraska | — | | 183,600
Wyoming | — | | 1,100 
Kansas | — | | 800 
Total | 62,100 | | 335,100

Leases that are held by production generally remain in force so long as oil or natural gas is produced from the well on 
7

the particular lease.  Leased acres which are not held by production may require annual rental payments to maintain the lease until the expiration of the lease or the time oil or natural gas is produced from one or more wells drilled on the leased acreage.  At the time oil or natural gas is produced from wells drilled on the leased acreage, the lease is generally considered to be held by production.

The following table shows the calendar years during which our leases not currently held by production will expire unless a productive oil or natural gas well is drilled on the lease or the lease is renewed.

Leased Acres(Gross) | Expirationof Lease
50,500 | 2017 
66,700 | 2018 
24,700 | 2019

The overriding royalty interests that we own are not material to our business.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves

Our estimated proved reserve quantities increased by 41% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016.  At December 31, 2016, we had estimated proved reserves of 38.0 million barrels of oil and 331.9 billion cubic feet of gas. The estimated standardized measure of future net cash flow from our reserves at December 31, 2016 was $434.3 million and the 
estimated PV-10 value of our reserves at that date was $476.3 million. PV-10 is a non-GAAP measure that reflects the present value, discounted at 10%, of estimated future net revenues from our proved reserves. We present a reconciliation of PV-10 value to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows in Item 7 under "Non-GAAP Financial Measures." The PV-10 value as of December 31, 2016 increased compared to December 31, 2015 by $38.2 million. The increase in estimated proved reserve quantities and PV-10 value is primarily due to better drilling efficiencies leading to an increase in the number of wells drilled per year and the GC Acquisition, which created spacing units with higher interests and the opportunity to drill longer laterals.
Ryder Scott prepared the estimates of our proved reserves, future production, and income attributable to our leasehold interests as of December 31, 2016.  Ryder Scott is an independent petroleum engineering firm that has been providing petroleum consulting services worldwide for over seventy years.  The estimates of proved reserves, future production, and income attributable to certain leasehold and royalty interests are based on technical analyses conducted by teams of geoscientists and engineers employed at Ryder Scott.  The office of Ryder Scott that prepared our reserves estimates is registered in the State of Texas (License #F-1580).  Ryder Scott prepared our reserve estimate based upon a review of property interests being appraised, historical production, lease operating expenses, price differentials, authorizations for expenditure, and geological and geophysical data.

The report of Ryder Scott dated January 20, 2017, which contains further discussions of the reserve estimates and evaluations prepared by Ryder Scott, as well as the qualifications of Ryder Scott’s technical personnel responsible for overseeing such estimates and evaluations, is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our reserves technical team, which consists of our Reservoir Engineering Manager, VP of Exploration, COO - Operations, and COO - Development, oversaw the preparation of the reserve estimates by Ryder Scott to ensure accuracy and completeness of the data prior to and after submission.  Our technical team has an average of over thirty years of experience in oil and gas exploration and development.

Our proved reserves include only those amounts which we reasonably expect to recover in the future from known oil and natural gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, at current prices and costs, under existing regulatory practices, and with existing technology.  Accordingly, any changes in prices, operating and development costs, regulations, technology, or other factors could significantly increase or decrease estimates of proved reserves.

Estimates of volumes of proved reserves at year end are presented in barrels for oil and Mcf for natural gas at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the natural gas reserves are located.

The proved reserves attributable to producing wells and/or reservoirs were estimated by performance methods.  These performance methods include decline curve analysis, which incorporate extrapolations of historical production and pressure data 
8

available through December 31, 2016 in those cases where this data was considered to be definitive.  The data used in this analysis was obtained from public sources and was considered sufficient for calculating producing reserves. The undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method.  The analogy method uses pertinent well data obtained from public sources that was available through December 31, 2016.

Below are estimates of our net proved reserves at December 31, 2016, all of which are located in Colorado:

The prices for the oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2016 are based on the twelve-month arithmetic average for the first of month prices from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. The following table presents the prices used to prepare the reserve estimates, based upon the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the twelve-month period prior to the end of the respective reporting period presented as adjusted for our differentials:

 | Oil (Bbl) | | Natural Gas (Mcf)
December 31, 2016 (Average) | $ | 36.07 | | $ | 2.44
December 31, 2015 (Average) | $ | 41.33 | | $ | 2.60
August 31, 2015 (Average) | $ | 53.27 | | $ | 3.28
August 31, 2014 (Average) | $ | 89.48 | | $ | 5.03


During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the combined effect of our drilling, acquisition, and participation activities partially offset by declining commodity prices generated an increase in projected future cash inflow from proved reserves of $470.1 million and an increase in future pre-tax net cash flow of $44.0 million from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016.  During the same period, our PV-10 from proved reserves increased by $38.2 million.  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we incurred capital expenditures of approximately $283.3 million related to the acquisition and development of proved reserves. 
Our drilling, acquisition, and participation activities during the four months ended December 31, 2015 and changes in commodity prices resulted in a decrease in projected future cash inflow from proved reserves of $336.0 million from August 31, 2015. Future pre-tax net cash flow decreased $25.2 million from August 31, 2015 to December 31, 2015. During that same period, our PV-10 from proved reserves decreased by $0.1 million.  During the four months ended December 31, 2015, we incurred capital expenditures of approximately $92.5 million related to the acquisition and development of proved reserves.
Our drilling, acquisition, and participation activities, partially offset by declining commodity prices, during the year ended August 31, 2015 generated an increase in projected future cash inflow from proved reserves of $206.6 million compared to August 31, 2014. However, future pre-tax net cash flow decreased $149.6 million from August 31, 2014 to August 31, 2015 as per-unit costs did not decline commensurate with per-unit future cash inflow.  During that same period, our PV-10 from proved reserves decreased by $95.4 million.  During the year ended August 31, 2015, we incurred capital expenditures of approximately $203.2 million related to the acquisition and development of proved reserves.
Our drilling, acquisition, and participation activities during the year ended August 31, 2014 and changes in commodity prices resulted in increases in projected future cash inflow from proved reserves of $1.1 billion and future pre-tax net cash flow of $538.1 million from August 31, 2013.  During that same period, our PV-10 from proved reserves increased by $297.6 million.  During the year ended August 31, 2014, we incurred capital expenditures of approximately $185.1 million related to the acquisition and development of proved reserves.
In general, the volume of production from our oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted.  Unless we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities, or both, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced.  Accordingly, volumes generated from our future activities are highly dependent upon our success in acquiring or finding additional reserves, and the costs incurred in doing so.

At December 31, 2016, our proved undeveloped reserves were 75,489 MBOE. During 2016, the GC Acquisition, along with other minor acquisitions, led to an increase of 50,530 MBOE in proved undeveloped reserves.  These acquisitions allowed for creating spacing units with higher working interests, opportunities to drill longer laterals, and increased focus on our development program in the core Wattenberg area. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of 12,144 MBOE as a result of the removal of certain legacy PUD locations as they are now expected to be developed beyond the three-year drilling plan. In addition to the 806 MBOE of prior year proved undeveloped reserves converted to proved developed reserves, we developed 3,217 MBOE of acquired proved undeveloped reserves during the year, and we drilled 5.4 net exploratory wells. Further, due to a better commodity market environment, our increase in expected drilling activity positively affected our proved undeveloped reserves.  While our 2015 reserves estimate assumed no rig initially then an increase to two rigs during the first year, our 2016 reserves estimate now assumes two rigs working continually throughout the three-year plan period. In addition to the undeveloped locations added as a result of recent drilling and acquisitions, we limited our undeveloped locations related to horizontal wells to be drilled within this three-year horizon due to the current uncertainty in the oil and gas environment. 
During the year end December 31, 2016, we converted 806 MBOE, or 2%, of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015 into proved developed reserves, requiring $9.4 million of drilling and completion capital expenditures. Due to the timing of our drilling operations and the use of multi-well pads, we ended the year with 3 fully drilled pads, comprised of 30 gross (27.8 net) wells, that were awaiting completion, of which 18 gross (16.4 net) were classified as proved undeveloped locations, representing 19% of proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015 and 12% of proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2016. All 30 of these wells are being completed in the first half of 2017.  All proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2016 are expected to be converted to proved producing within three years, and within five years of their initial booking.  Based on our current drilling plans for the next three years, we expect to allocate more funds to developmental drilling in areas of established production where ongoing and planned infrastructure buildout continues. None of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2016 have been in this category for more than five years.
At December 31, 2015, our proved undeveloped reserves were 48,289 MBOE. We drilled 9 net exploratory wells and 4 
11

net development wells during the four months ended December 31, 2015. This generated proved developed reserves from those exploratory wells as well as new proved undeveloped reserves due to direct offset locations. As a result, we recognized an increase in proved undeveloped reserves from extensions of 17,161 MBOE. The 4 net development wells converted 1,869 MBOE during the four months ended December 31, 2015, or 4%, of our proved undeveloped reserves as of August 31, 2015 into proved developed reserves, requiring $17.7 million of drilling and completion capital expenditures.
At August 31, 2015, our proved undeveloped reserves were 41,621 MBOE. We drilled 40 net exploratory wells and one net development well during the year ended August 31, 2015. This generated proved developed reserves from those exploratory wells, as well as new proved undeveloped reserves due to direct offset locations. In addition, our reserve estimates reflect the positive impact of additional offset operator activities within the Wattenberg Field. As a result, we recognized an increase in proved undeveloped reserves from extensions of 17,633 MBOE. The one net development well converted 414 MBOE during the year ended August 31, 2015, or 2%, of our proved undeveloped reserves as of August 31, 2014 into proved developed reserves, requiring $5.0 million of drilling and completion capital expenditures.
At August 31, 2014, our proved undeveloped reserves were 19,211 MBOE. During the year ended August 31, 2014, 587 MBOE or 12% of our proved undeveloped reserves as of August 31, 2013 were converted into proved developed reserves, requiring $14.9 million of drilling and completion capital expenditures. Executing our capital program during the year ended August 31, 2014 resulted in the addition of 13,436 MBOE in proved undeveloped reserves. 
Delivery Commitments

Competition and Marketing
We are faced with strong competition from many other companies and individuals engaged in the oil and gas business, many of which are very large, well-established energy companies with substantial capabilities and established earnings records.  We may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring oil and gas prospects since we must compete with these individuals and companies, many of which have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs.  It is nearly impossible to estimate the number of competitors; however, it is known that there are a large number of companies and individuals in the oil and gas business.
Exploration for and production of oil and natural gas are affected by the availability of pipe, casing and other tubular goods, and certain other oil field equipment including drilling rigs and tools.  We depend upon independent contractors to furnish rigs, pressure pumping equipment, and tools to drill and complete our wells.  Higher prices for oil and natural gas may result in competition among operators for drilling and completion equipment, tubular goods, and drilling and completion crews, which may affect our ability expeditiously to drill, complete, recomplete, and work over wells.
The market for oil and natural gas is dependent upon a number of factors beyond our control, which at times cannot be accurately predicted.  These factors include the proximity of wells to, and the capacity of, oil and natural gas pipelines, the extent of competitive domestic production and imports of oil and gas, the availability of other sources of energy, fluctuations in seasonal supply and demand, and governmental regulation.  In addition, there is always the possibility that new legislation may be enacted that would impose price controls or additional excise taxes upon oil, natural gas, or both.  Oversupplies of oil and natural gas can be expected to occur from time to time and may result in the producing wells being shut-in.  Imports of oil and natural gas may adversely affect the market for domestic oil and natural gas.
The market price for oil is significantly affected by policies adopted by the member nations of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or OPEC.  Members of OPEC establish production quotas among themselves for petroleum products from time to time with the intent of influencing the global supply of oil and consequently price levels.  We are unable to predict the effect, if any, that OPEC, its members, or other countries will have on the amount of, or the prices received for, oil and natural gas.
Natural gas prices are now largely influenced by competition.  Competitors in this market include producers, natural gas pipelines and their affiliated marketing companies, independent marketers, and providers of alternate energy supplies, such as coal.  Changes in government regulations relating to the production, transportation, and marketing of natural gas have also resulted in significant changes in the historical marketing patterns of the industry.

Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations that change from time to time. Many of these regulations are intended to prevent pollution and protect environmental quality, including regulations related to permit requirements for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling, completing and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, groundwater testing, air emissions, noise, lighting and traffic abatement, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Other regulations are intended to prevent the waste of oil and natural gas and to protect the rights among owners in a common reservoir. These include regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number or density of wells that may be drilled in an area, the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas wells, and regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and that impose requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. In addition, our operations are subject to regulations governing the pipeline gathering and transportation of oil and natural gas as well as various federal, state, and local tax laws and regulations.
Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and gas industry are generally subject to regulatory requirements and restrictions similar to those that affect our operations. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance.
Regulation of production
Federal, state, and local agencies have promulgated extensive rules and regulations applicable to our oil and gas exploration, production, and related operations.  Most states require drilling permits, drilling and operating bonds, the filing of various reports, and the satisfaction of other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas.  Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters including provisions governing the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the density of wells, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. The number of drilling locations available to us will depend in part on the spacing of wells in our operating areas. An increase in well density in an area could result in additional locations in that area, but a reduced production performance from the area on a per-well basis. In addition, certain of the horizontal wells we intend to drill in the future may require pooling of our lease interests with the interests of third parties.  Some states like Colorado allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely primarily or exclusively on the voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In areas with voluntary pooling, it may be more difficult to develop a project if the operator owns less than 100% of the leasehold, or one or more of our leases does not provide the necessary pooling authority. Further, the statutes and regulations of some states limit the rate at which oil and natural gas is produced from properties, prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. This may limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or locations at which we can drill.  The federal and state regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability.  Because these rules and regulations are amended or reinterpreted frequently, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with these laws.
The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (“COGCC”) is the primary regulator of exploration and production of oil and gas resources in the principal area in which we operate.  The COGCC regulates oil and gas operators through rules, policies, written guidance, orders, permits, and inspections. Among other things, the COGCC enforces specifications regarding drilling, development, production, abandonment, enhanced recovery, safety, aesthetics, noise, waste, flowlines, and wildlife.  In recent years, the COGCC has amended its existing regulatory requirements and adopted new requirements with increased frequency. For example, in August 2013, the COGCC implemented new setback rules for oil and natural gas wells and production facilities near occupied buildings. The COGCC increased its setback distance to a uniform 500 feet statewide setback from occupied buildings and imposed new notice, meeting, and mitigation requirements for nearby homes and communities. In January 2013, the COGCC approved new rules that require operators to sample groundwater for hydrocarbons and other indicator compounds both before and after drilling. In December 2013, the COGCC issued new and more restrictive rules regarding spill reporting and remediation. In December 2014, the COGCC issued amendments clarifying and modifying a number of existing rules, including those governing drilling, plugging, mechanical integrity testing, blow out prevention, and waste management. In January 2015, the COGCC amended its enforcement and penalty rules to increase the maximum penalty for regulatory violations. In March 2015, the COGCC adopted new requirements for operations within floodplains. In January 2016, the COGCC approved new rules that require local government consultation and certain best management practices for large-scale oil and natural gas facilities in certain urban mitigation areas. The new rules also require operator registration and/or notifications to local governments with respect to future oil and natural gas drilling and production facility locations.

Regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas
Historically, the transportation and sales for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulations. Effective January 1, 1993, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act deregulated the price for all “first sales” of natural gas. Thus, all of our sales of natural gas may be made at market prices, subject to applicable contract provisions. Sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms, and cost of pipeline transportation. Since 1985, the FERC has implemented regulations intended to make natural gas transportation more accessible to gas buyers and sellers on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. We cannot predict what further action the FERC will take on these matters. Some of the FERC's more recent proposals may, however, adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines. We do not believe that we will be affected by any action taken materially differently than other natural gas producers, gatherers, and marketers with which we compete.
Our natural gas sales are generally made at the prevailing market price at the time of sale. Therefore, even though we sell significant volumes to major purchasers, we believe that other purchasers would be willing to buy our natural gas at comparable market prices.
In August 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “2005 EPA”) was signed into law. The 2005 EPA directs the FERC, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”), and other federal agencies to issue regulations that will further the goals set out in the 2005 EPA. The 2005 EPA amends the NGA to make it unlawful for “any entity,” including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers such as us, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. FERC rules implementing this provision make it unlawful in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The anti-manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” natural gas sales, purchases, or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. It, therefore, reflects a significant expansion of the FERC's enforcement authority. To date, we do not believe that we have been, nor do we anticipate that we will be, affected any differently than other producers of natural gas.
In 2007, the FERC issued a final rule on annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (“Order 704”). Under Order 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million MMBtu of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, natural gas gatherers, natural gas processors, and natural gas marketers, are now required to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. The monitoring and reporting required by these rules have increased our administrative costs. To date, we do not believe that we have been, nor do we anticipate that we will be, affected any differently than other producers of natural gas.
Regulation of sales and transportation of oil
Our sales of oil are affected by the availability, terms, and cost of transportation. Interstate transportation of oil by pipeline is regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”), the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on oil pipelines, including interstate pipelines that transport oil and refined products (collectively referred to as “petroleum pipelines”) be just and reasonable and non-discriminatory and that such rates and terms and conditions of service be filed with the FERC.
Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective, interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we do not believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will affect our operations in any way that is materially different than those of our competitors who are similarly situated.
In May 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a final rule regarding the safe transportation of flammable liquids by rail. The final rule imposes certain requirements on “offerors” of oil, including sampling, testing, and certification 
15

requirements. In October 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration proposed to expand its regulations in a number of ways, including increased regulation of gathering lines, even in rural areas. 
Regulation of derivatives and reporting of government payments
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was passed by Congress and signed into law in July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act is designed to provide, among other things, a comprehensive framework for the regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market with the intent to provide greater transparency and reduction of risk between counterparties. The Dodd-Frank Act subjects certain derivative market participants to a variety of capital, margin, and other requirements and requires many derivative transactions to be cleared on exchanges. The Dodd-Frank Act provides for a potential exemption from certain of these requirements for commercial end-users.
Environmental Regulations
As with the oil and natural gas industry in general, our properties are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and local laws and regulations designed to protect and preserve natural resources and the environment.  Long-term and recent trends in environmental legislation and regulation are generally toward stricter standards, and this trend is likely to continue.  These laws and regulations often require a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities; limit or prohibit access, seismic acquisition, construction, drilling, and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness and other protected areas; mandate requirements and standards for operations; impose substantial liabilities and remedial obligations for pollution; and require the reclamation of certain lands.
The permits required for many of our operations are subject to revocation, modification, and renewal by issuing authorities.  Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations are subject to fines, injunctions, or both.  In March 2015, the COGCC implemented regulatory and statutory amendments that significantly increase the potential penalties for violating the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Act or its implementing regulations, orders, or permits. These amendments increase the maximum penalty per violation per day from $1,000 to $15,000; eliminate the $10,000 maximum penalty for violations without significant consequences; require the COGCC to assess a penalty for each day of violation; and authorize the COGCC to prohibit the issuance of new permits and suspend certificates of clearance for egregious violations. Following the adoption of this new penalty scheme, Colorado operators have experienced increased penalties for violations within COGCC’s jurisdiction. In the opinion of our management, we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements.  Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or in their interpretation could have a significant impact on us as well as the oil and gas industry in general.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and comparable state statutes impose strict and joint and several liability on owners and operators of certain sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of “hazardous substances” found at such sites.  Persons responsible for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up those substances and for damages to natural resources. It is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.   Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from its definition of “hazardous substance,” state laws affecting our operations impose clean-up liability relating to petroleum and petroleum-related products.  The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of “solid waste” and “hazardous waste” and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance.  Although RCRA classifies certain oil field wastes as non-hazardous "solid wastes,” such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes, thereby making such wastes subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements. In May 2016, certain environmental groups filed suit against the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA") in federal court for failing to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, asserting that the agency has not reviewed its RCRA Subtitle D regulations since July 1988. A proposed consent decree filed in December 2016 between EPA and the environmental groups commits EPA to decide whether to revise its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations and state plan guidelines for the oil and natural gas sector by March 2019.
Certain of our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and similar state and local requirements. The CAA may require certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations. The EPA and states continue to develop regulations to implement these requirements. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits and approvals addressing other air-emission-related issues. Greenhouse gas recordkeeping and reporting requirements under the CAA took effect in 2011 and impose increased administrative and control costs. Federal New Source Performance Standards regarding oil and gas operations (“NSPS OOOO”) took effect in 2012, with more subsequent amendments, all of which have likewise added 
16

administrative and operational costs. In June 2016, EPA finalized new regulations under the CAA to reduce methane emissions from new and modified sources in the oil and natural gas sector. These new regulations impose, among other things, new requirements for leak detection and repair, control requirements at oil well completions, and additional control requirements for gathering, boosting, and compressor stations. Concurrent with the proposed methane rules, the EPA also finalized a new rule regarding source determinations and permitting requirements for the onshore oil and gas industry under the CAA. Colorado adopted new regulations to meet the requirements of NSPS OOOO and promulgated significant new rules in February 2014 relating specifically to oil and natural gas operations that are more stringent than NSPS OOOO and directly regulate methane emissions from affected facilities.
In October 2015, the EPA lowered the national ambient air quality standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone under the CAA from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. Any resulting expansion of the ozone nonattainment areas in Colorado could cause oil and natural gas operations in such areas to become subject to more stringent emissions controls, emission offset requirements, and increased permitting delays and costs. In addition, the ozone nonattainment status for the Denver Metro North Front Range Ozone 8-Hour Non-Attainment area was bumped up by the EPA from “marginal” to “moderate” as a result of the area failing to attain the 2008 ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of July 20, 2015. In 2016, the state of Colorado undertook a rulemaking to address the new “moderate” status, culminating in, among others, the incorporation of two existing state-only requirements for oil and natural gas operations into the federally-enforceable State Implementation Plan ("SIP"). During the fall of 2016, EPA also issued final Control Techniques Guidelines ("CTGs") for reducing volatile organic compound emissions from existing oil and natural gas equipment and processes in ozone non-attainment areas, including the Denver Metro North Front Range Ozone 8-hour Non-Attainment area. In 2017, as part of the federal CTG process for oil and natural gas, Colorado will begin a stakeholder and rulemaking effort to compare the CTGs to existing Colorado requirements to ensure they meet applicable federal requirements. This process could result in new or more stringent air quality control requirements applicable to our operations. On March 10, 2016, EPA announced its intention to initiate a formal process under CAA § 111(d) to require companies operating existing oil and gas sources to provide information to assist EPA in developing comprehensive regulations to reduce methane emissions. Related to this effort, EPA sent out Information Collection Requests ("ICRs") in late 2016 to operators to gather information on existing sources of methane emissions, technologies to reduce those emissions, and the costs of those technologies in the production, gathering, processing, and transmission and storage segments of the oil and natural gas sector.
The federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws impose requirements regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the U.S. and the state, including spills and leaks of hydrocarbons and produced water. The CWA also requires approval for the construction of facilities in wetlands and other waters of the U.S., and it imposes requirements on storm water run-off. In June 2016, the EPA finalized new CWA pretreatment standards that would prevent onshore unconventional oil and natural gas wells from discharging wastewater pollutants to public treatment facilities. In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers adopted a new regulatory definition of “waters of the U.S.,” which governs which waters and wetlands are subject to the CWA. This final rule has been stayed pending the resolution of ongoing litigation. Depending upon if and how the new definition is implemented, it could significantly expand the jurisdictional reach of the CWA in many states, including Colorado.
The Endangered Species Act restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Some of our operations may be located in areas that are or may be designated as habitats for threatened or endangered species. In such areas, we may be prohibited from conducting operations at certain locations or during certain periods, and we may be required to develop plans for avoiding potential adverse effects. In addition, certain species are subject to varying degrees of protection under state laws.
Federal laws including the CWA require certain owners or operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil and produced water to prepare and implement spill prevention, control, countermeasure and response plans addressing the possible discharge of oil into surface waters. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) subjects owners and operators of facilities to strict and joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from oil spills, including the government’s response costs. Spills subject to the OPA may result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities.
In 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases ("GHGs") present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth's atmosphere and other climatic conditions. Based on these findings, the EPA adopted regulations under the CAA that, among other things, established Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”), construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are already major sources of emissions of regulated pollutants. In a subsequent ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a portion of EPA’s GHG stationary source program, but invalidated a portion of it. The Court held that stationary sources already subject to the PSD or Title V program for non-GHG criteria pollutants remained subject to GHG best available control technology ("BACT") requirements, but ruled that sources subject to the PSD or Title V program only for GHGs could not be forced to comply with GHG BACT requirements. Upon remand, the D.C. Circuit issued an amended judgment, which, among other things, vacated the PSD and Title V regulations

under review in that case to the extent they require a stationary source to obtain a PSD or Title V permit solely because the source emits or has the potential to emit GHGs above the applicable major source thresholds. In October 2016, EPA issued a proposed rule to revise its PSD and Title V regulations applicable to GHGs in accordance with these court rulings, including proposing a de minimis level of GHG emissions below which BACT is not required. Depending on what EPA does in a final rule, it is possible that any regulatory or permitting obligation that limits emissions of GHGs could extend to smaller stationary sources and require us to incur costs to reduce and monitor emissions of GHGs associated with our operations and also adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.
In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified GHG emission sources in the United States, including certain onshore oil and natural gas production sources, which include certain of our operations. While Congress has not enacted significant legislation relating to GHG emissions, it may do so in the future and, moreover, several state and regional initiatives have been enacted aimed at monitoring and/or reducing GHG emissions through cap and trade programs.
The adoption of new laws, regulations, or other requirements limiting or imposing other obligations on GHG emissions from our equipment and operations, and the implementation of requirements that have already been adopted, could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. In addition, substantial limitations on GHG emissions in other sectors, such as the power sector under EPA’s August 2015 Clean Power Plan, could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the Clean Power Plan pending judicial review. Further GHG regulation may result from the December 2015 agreement reached at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris. Pursuant to the agreement, the United States made an initial pledge to a 26-28% reduction in its GHG emission by 2025 against a 2005 baseline and committed to periodically update its pledge in five yearly intervals starting in 2020. GHG emissions in the earth’s atmosphere have also been shown to produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operations.
Hydraulic Fracturing
We operate primarily in the Wattenberg Field of the D-J Basin where the rock formations are typically tight, and it is a common practice to use hydraulic fracturing to allow for or increase hydrocarbon production.  Hydraulic fracturing involves the process of injecting substances such as water, sand, and additives (some proprietary) under pressure into a targeted subsurface formation to create fractures, thus creating a passageway for the release of oil and gas.  Hydraulic fracturing is a technique that we commonly employ and expect to employ extensively in future wells that we drill and complete.
We outsource all hydraulic fracturing services to service providers with significant experience, and which we deem to be competent and responsible.  Our service providers supply all personnel, equipment, and materials needed to perform each stimulation, including the chemical mixtures that are injected into our wells.  We require our service companies to carry insurance covering various losses and liabilities that could arise in connection with their activities; however, insurance may not be available or adequate to cover losses and liabilities incurred, or may be prohibitively expensive relative to the perceived risk.  In addition to the drilling permit that we are required to obtain and the notice of intent that we provide the appropriate regulatory authorities, our service providers are responsible for obtaining any regulatory permits necessary for them to perform their services in the relevant geographic location.  We have not had any incidents, citations, or lawsuits relating to any environmental issues resulting from hydraulic fracturing, and we are not presently aware of any such matters.
In recent years, environmental opposition to hydraulic fracturing has increased, and various governmental and regulatory authorities have adopted or are considering new requirements for this process. To the extent that these requirements increase our costs or restrict our development activities, our business and prospects may be adversely affected.
The EPA has asserted that the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) applies to hydraulic fracturing involving diesel fuel, and in February 2014, it issued final guidance on this subject. The guidance defines the term “diesel fuel,” describes the permitting requirements that apply under SDWA for the underground injection of diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing, and makes recommendations for permit writers. Although the guidance applies only in those states, excluding Colorado, where the EPA directly implements the Underground Injection Control Class II program, it could encourage state regulatory authorities to adopt permitting and other requirements for hydraulic fracturing. In addition, from time to time, Congress has considered legislation that would provide for broader federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA. If such legislation were enacted, hydraulic fracturing operations could be required to meet additional federal permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations, and provide for additional public disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process.

The EPA has also conducted a nationwide study into the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water. In June 2015, the EPA released a draft study report for peer review and comment. The draft report did not find evidence of widespread systemic impacts to drinking water, but did find a relatively small number of site-specific impacts. The EPA noted that these results could indicate that such effects are rare or that other limiting factors exist. In December 2016, EPA released the final report on impacts from hydraulic fracturing activities on drinking water, concluding that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances and identifying some factors that could influence these impacts.
Federal agencies have also adopted or are considering additional regulation of hydraulic fracturing. On March 26, 2016, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) issued a final rule, with effective dates of 2018 and 2021 for the hydraulic fracturing industry, which imposes stricter standards for worker exposure to silica, including worker exposure to sand in hydraulic fracturing. In May 2014, the EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) to obtain data on chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. In March 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) issued a new rule regulating hydraulic fracturing activities involving federal and tribal lands and minerals, including requirements for chemical disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback and produced water. Due to pending litigation, however, the effective date of the rule has been postponed.
In November 2016, BLM finalized rules to further regulate venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Indian leases. The rules became effective in January 2017, but are subject to ongoing litigation.
In Colorado, the primary regulator is the COGCC, which has adopted regulations regarding chemical disclosure, pressure monitoring, prior agency notice, emission reduction practices, and offset well setbacks with respect to hydraulic fracturing operations and may in the future adopt additional requirements for this purpose. As part of these requirements, operators must report all chemicals used in hydraulically fracturing a well to a publicly searchable registry website developed and maintained by the Ground Water Protection Council and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission.
Apart from these ongoing federal and state initiatives, local governments are adopting new requirements and restrictions on hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas operations. Some local governments in Colorado, for instance, have amended their land use regulations to impose new requirements on oil and gas development, while other local governments have entered memoranda of agreement with oil and gas producers to accomplish the same objective. Beyond that, during the past few years, a total of five Colorado cities have passed voter initiatives temporarily or permanently prohibiting hydraulic fracturing. Since that time, however, local district courts have struck down the ordinances for certain of those Colorado cities, and such decisions were upheld by the Colorado Supreme Court in May 2016. Nevertheless, there is a continued risk that cities will adopt local ordinances that seek to regulate the time, place, and manner of hydraulic fracturing activities and oil and gas operations within their respective jurisdictions. 
During 2014, opponents of hydraulic fracturing also sought statewide ballot initiatives that would have restricted oil and gas development in Colorado by, among other things, significantly increasing the setback between oil and natural gas wells and occupied buildings. These initiatives were withdrawn from the November 2014 ballot in return for the creation of a task force to craft recommendations for minimizing land use conflicts over the location of oil and natural gas facilities. 
During 2016, opponents of hydraulic fracturing again advanced various options for ballot initiatives restricting oil and gas development in Colorado. Proponents of two such initiatives attempted to qualify the initiatives to appear on the ballot for the November 2016 election. One would have amended the Colorado constitution to impose a minimum distance of 2,500 feet between wells and any occupied structures or "areas of special concern". If implemented, this proposal would have made the vast majority of the surface area of the state ineligible for drilling, including substantially all of our planned future drilling locations. The second proposal would have amended the state constitution to give local governmental authorities the ability to regulate, or to ban, oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities within their boundaries notwithstanding state rules and approvals to the contrary. If implemented, this proposal could have resulted in us becoming subject to onerous, and possibly inconsistent, regulations that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, or to outright bans on our activities in various jurisdictions. In August 2016, the Colorado Secretary of State issued a press release and statements of insufficiency of signatures, stating that the proponents of the proposals had failed to collect enough valid signatures to have the proposals included on the ballot. However, similar proposals may be made in the future. Because a substantial portion of our operations and reserves are located in Colorado, the risks we face with respect to such future proposals are greater than those of our competitors with more geographically diverse operations. Although we cannot predict the outcome of future ballot initiatives, statutes, or regulatory developments, such developments could materially impact our results of operations, production, and reserves.
