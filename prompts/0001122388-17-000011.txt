Our Company
We are a leading provider of innovative on-demand software solutions and services for the residential mortgage industry in the United States. Banks, credit unions, mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers use our Encompass® all-in-one mortgage management solution to originate and fund mortgages and improve compliance, loan quality, and efficiency. At December 31, 2016, approximately 165,000 mortgage professionals used Encompass for their mortgage management solution.
Our Encompass software is a comprehensive, end-to-end enterprise solution that handles most of the functions involved in running the business of originating mortgages including: customer relationship management; loan processing; underwriting; preparation of mortgage applications, disclosure agreements, and closing documents; funding and closing the loan for the borrower; compliance with regulatory and investor requirements and overall enterprise management that provides one system of record for loans. Delivery of our Encompass software in an on-demand Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, environment provides customers with the added benefits of lower up front implementation costs and reduced need for an infrastructure of servers, storage and network devices as well as the staff needed to support the infrastructure. SaaS delivery of Encompass enables access to the most current version of our software, including periodic upgrades and regulatory updates. We also host the Ellie Mae Network, a proprietary electronic platform that allows Encompass users to conduct electronic business transactions with mortgage investors (also referred to as “investors”) and service providers they work with in order to process and fund loans.
For mortgage originators, Encompass is a comprehensive mortgage management system that handles key business and management functions involved in running a residential mortgage origination business. Mortgage originators use Encompass as a single tool for loan processing, marketing, and customer communication and to interact electronically with lenders, investors, and service providers over the Ellie Mae Network. For the lenders, investors and service providers on the Ellie Mae Network, we provide electronic connectivity that allows them to do business with mortgage origination professionals using Encompass. We also offer Encompass users a variety of other on-demand software services delivered within Encompass which are discussed below in our Product and Services overview.
Mortgage originators pay for Encompass in one of two models: recurring monthly subscription fees or monthly subscription fees based on the number of licensed users combined with transaction fees based mortgages funded, which we refer to as Success Based Pricing. Our additional services are paid on either a subscription or transaction basis. Lenders, investors and service providers participating in the Ellie Mae Network also pay us fees, generally on a per transaction basis, for transactions processed through the Ellie Mae Network from Encompass users.
Under the AllRegs brand, our research and reference products include single and multifamily underwriting & insuring guidelines as well as libraries of federal and state laws and regulations, and we are the exclusive electronic publisher of certain mortgage lending guidelines for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and The Federal Home Loan Bank. Our educational division, AllRegs Academy, offers courses related to the mortgage industry, including self-paced training, instructor-led online courses, webinars or live classroom training and certified continuing education classes for state licensed mortgage originators. In addition, through the AllRegs brand, we offer documentation and learning management solutions to facilitate our customers’ mortgage lending compliance, as well as data and analytics services relating to investor loan products.

Mortgage Industry Overview
Overview of Mortgage Origination Market
Mortgage originators typically advise borrowers, process loan files, collect, and verify the property and borrower data upon which lending decisions are based and, in the majority of cases, fund and close mortgage loans. According to data available pursuant to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), there were more than 6,0001 mortgage lenders in 2016 in the United States, including national banks, regional banks, non-bank lenders and credit unions. 
Based on estimates provided by the Mortgage Bankers Association, there were $1.9 trillion, $1.7 trillion, $1.3 trillion, $1.8 trillion, and $2.0 trillion2 in loans originated for 1- to 4-family homes during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
The Mortgage Origination Process
Originating a residential mortgage involves multiple parties and requires a complex series of data-laden transactions that must be handled accurately under tight time constraints. By the time a mortgage has been funded, the typical loan package contains over one thousand pages of documents that come from over a dozen different entities, usually operating on disparate technology systems and databases. Traditionally, much of the data used to prepare these documents has been gathered manually, rather than electronically, with documents exchanged among the many participants by facsimile, courier or mail. The entire process results in significant duplicative efforts, time delays, errors, costs, and redundant paper documentation, and often exposes borrower data to potential privacy and security breaches.

The following diagram of the mortgage origination process provides a framework for understanding the complexity and inefficiency of the process and the need for automated solutions. 
In addition to the challenges involved in processing loans, mortgage originators must satisfy a multitude of federal, state and local regulations, and address basic business needs, including marketing, sales, product fulfillment, customer support, reporting, and general management functions. Historically, most mortgage originators have operated their businesses using separate task-specific software applications that were interconnected, if at all, through customized integrations. This often resulted in constraints on effective collaboration among operating departments, limited ability to monitor the business comprehensively, increased risk of error due to inconsistent data, failure to incorporate current regulations into work flows, inadequate security and control over the process, and expensive technical integration and maintenance costs.
Recent Mortgage Industry Trends and Developments
The residential mortgage industry continues to evolve and undergo significant changes. There are five major trends that are currently impacting the residential mortgage industry.
Greater Focus on Operational Efficiencies
The average total production cost per loan was $6,969 in the third quarter of 2016.3 We expect operational costs to continue to be a significant consideration for mortgage originators due to the continuously changing regulatory environment and heightened quality standards. As a result, mortgage originators have sought to increase their efficiency and reduce fixed expenses, leading them to explore technology solutions to automate their business processes as well as methods to avoid or reduce expenses that are not tied to revenue generating activities.
Customers Adopting Multi-Channel Strategies
Customers are developing multi-channel strategies beyond a single retail, correspondent or wholesale mortgage lending channel in order to grow their businesses. The requirements of these different channels vary and in order to maintain a single operating system, customers must use a robust system with customizable functionality.

Changes in Regulation Affecting Lenders and Investors
Mortgage lending regulations continue to change and many regulatory reforms have been introduced or proposed in recent years to promote increased underwriting standards and accountability by lenders and mortgage originators, ensure meaningful disclosures by lenders to borrowers, increase the transparency and objectivity of settlement services, and protect consumers in the mortgage market from unfair or abuse lending practices. Many of the significant changes in regulations were issued in 2014 and 2015 including legal changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, and associated regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB. These regulatory changes have complicated the mortgage origination process and increased the amount of documentation required to originate and fund residential mortgages. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in our products and services to address changing regulations
Increased Quality Standards Imposed by Regulators, Lenders and Investors
Lenders have eliminated many high-risk loan product offerings and significantly tightened underwriting and processing requirements. Similarly, investors seek higher-quality, lower-risk loans in which to invest. Consistent with these tightened standards and expectations, lenders and investors are demanding increased levels of documentation of the data upon which a lending decision will be based, increased use of third-party services to obtain unbiased and independent verification of borrowers’ creditworthiness, greater proof of the adequacy of the collateral securing mortgages and strict compliance with regulatory requirements. This trend further increases the amount of documentation and number of services required to originate and fund residential mortgages. Increased enforcement by federal and state regulators continues to encourage mortgage originators to explore technology solutions that provide adequate controls and policy enforcement to facilitate originating compliant loans.
Greater focus by customers and regulators on data security and consumer privacy
Recent high-profile data security incidents affecting banking institutions and their third party service providers have resulted in an increased focus on data security by our customers and our customers’ regulators. We expect the industry focus on data security to continue to increase as companies generate greater amounts of data and as future data security incidents occur.
Our Strategy
Our mission is to be the industry standard platform for residential mortgage origination in the United States. Key elements of our strategy include:
Increase the number of Encompass users.  We continue to focus our marketing, sales and product development efforts to increase the number of mortgage lenders, commercial banks, thrifts, and credit unions using Encompass and our additional services. Mortgage lenders typically require software with comprehensive functionality to meet their various needs and generally order most of the settlement and other services available on the Ellie Mae Network in the process of funding loans. We continue to grow our sales department as we expect many non-Encompass mortgage lenders to assess new platform options and replace their legacy systems in response to the increased quality standards and compliance mandates affecting the industry. We intend to continue to focus our efforts on all segments, including the largest, or enterprise segment, of the lending industry.
Expand our product and service offerings to Encompass users.  By utilizing our comprehensive suite of bundled products and services, customers avoid the risk and effort of cobbling together two or more solutions from our competing vendors. To the extent users do not subscribe to our bundled offering, we intend to encourage use of more of the Encompass services we currently offer, such as document preparation, electronic document management (“EDM”), compliance services, product and pricing services, fraud services, income tax verification services, flood services, appraisal services, website hosting and customer relationship management. As our customers opt for supplemental on-demand software and services, we generate additional revenues. These are services the lender uses to originate loans and by encouraging our customers to use these through the Encompass platform we can help offer the lender greater efficiency and cost savings and continue to drive additional revenue per user. We also intend to develop additional products and services to sell to our Encompass users.
Invest in new product & platform development. We are investing in the development of the next generation Encompass platform, known as Encompass NG, as well as the recently announced Encompass Connect solutions, each of which is built on the new Encompass Lending Platform and utilize Application Program Interfaces (“APIs”) to offer unique capabilities that help improve visibility and collaboration between loan officers, third-party originators, developers and homebuyers.
Expand the use of the Ellie Mae Network.  The Ellie Mae Network provides mortgage originators electronic access to many of the investors and most of the service providers, that they need to interact with in order to process and fund loans. These transactions include electronic ordering of credit reports, appraisal services, title and flood reports and accessing the automatic underwriting systems of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We will continue to encourage providers of settlement services to deliver these services electronically through the Ellie Mae Network, and we will continue to encourage adoption of these services by our 
5

customers. By integrating and expanding our current and new services, we aim to provide our customers a more comprehensive solution.
Sell enhanced Ellie Mae Network offerings to investors, lenders, and service providers.  We intend to continue to add functionality and services to the Ellie Mae Network so investors, lenders, and service providers can more effectively do business with mortgage originators using Encompass. Investors and lenders can populate mortgage originators’ Encompass software with specific compliance, underwriting, and documentation requirements for loans prior to delivery in order to screen loans for quality and regulatory compliance.
Investment in our Business.  We are investing aggressively in initiatives that we believe will help us continue to grow our business, improve our products and services, and strengthen our competitive advantage while bringing sustainable, long-term value to our customers. During 2016, we increased our investments in our sales and client services capabilities, research and development, data security, and technology infrastructure to support our user additions and overall business growth. These investments include expanding our talent across the organization by hiring additional personnel. In order to continue supporting our customers and to further differentiate ourselves, we currently anticipate that throughout 2017 we will continue to invest in key areas such as research and development, enterprise sales, services, technical support, data security, and data center infrastructure. This investment will include the development of current infrastructure to accommodate new users and our next generation Encompass platform, which we expect to incrementally introduce during 2017 and 2018.
Acquisitions.  Our industry is highly fragmented, and we believe there are strategic opportunities available to acquire technology-based companies that will complement and increase the attractiveness of our solutions. For example, in October 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Mortgage Returns, LLC, or Mortgage Returns, a provider of on-demand customer relationship management and marketing automation solutions for mortgage lenders. With the acquisition of Mortgage Returns, we are responding to the needs of our customers by adding a robust CRM solution for lenders of all sizes. We expect to continue to evaluate and explore strategic opportunities that will enhance the breadth and depth of our solutions, and furthers our mission of automating the entire end-to-end mortgage process for our customers.

Data Centers and Network Access
Our primary data centers are hosted by a leading SOC 1/SSAE-16 Type II certified provider of hosting services in Santa Clara, California and Chicago, Illinois. Applications we provide will run actively in either of these two sites at any time. In 2016, we started moving towards a hybrid cloud architecture that leverages our own data centers as well as an infrastructure as a service platform, commonly referred to as a “public cloud.” Moving towards a hybrid cloud architecture provides us with the scalability to expand our platform and application services, as well as increase availability and cost efficiencies to deliver on our product roadmap and service quality.
The hybrid cloud architecture hosts Encompass, the Ellie Mae Network and the other Encompass solutions and services. In the event of a complete site failure, such as may occur during a regional natural disaster, all of the services in a site can be recovered to the other data center or public cloud platform as part of our disaster recovery plan.
11

In 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Mortgage Returns, which operates a data center hosted by a leading SOC 1 certified provider in St. Louis, Missouri. Currently, our Encompass CRM application runs out of this site. During 2015 and 2016, a substantial investment was made to upgrade the data center infrastructure utilized by Mortgage Returns. This effort significantly increased overall capacity and performance to meet growing demand for Mortgage Returns’ services. In 2017, we plan to continue to invest in the data center infrastructure supporting our Encompass CRM application and also expand this into a hybrid cloud infrastructure.
Network Security
All sensitive data transmitted over public networks is encrypted using industry standard encryption protocols in order to protect sensitive data against third-party disclosure in transit. Servers and network components are secured with access control mechanisms and protected by hardened firewalls, virus protection, and intrusion prevention/detection systems. Security services and tools are monitored and updated in order to address emerging vulnerabilities. Even with our current security monitoring and detection systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches. We are committing significant resources to protect against and remedy any potential security breaches and their consequences and intend to keep doing so in the future. New threats and vulnerabilities are identified frequently and there are often time lags before our vendors deploy mitigations. In 2016, we made substantial investment in our network security infrastructure, including headcount and third party tools and systems. In 2017 and beyond, we will continue to make substantial investments in our network security infrastructure to protect the confidentiality and integrity of our customer data. 
Research and Development
We devote substantial resources to enhance the features and functionality of our offerings as well as developing new products and services. We are developing the next generation Encompass platform, known as Encompass NG, as well as the recently announced Encompass Connect solutions that leverage our new APIs and platform capabilities. These new products include our Encompass Consumer Connect solution to better equip our customers to deploy customized borrower-facing websites, Encompass TPO Connect which helps our customers better manage third-party originations with their partners, Encompass Loan Officer Connect which exposes a rich set of loan officer-facing functionality on mobile devices and Encompass Developer Connect which provides developers with APIs, tools and developer portal.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in large part on our proprietary products and technology for which we seek protection from a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws and other agreements with employees and third parties. We require our officers, employees, and consultants to enter into standard agreements containing provisions requiring the confidentiality of proprietary information and assignment to us of all inventions made during the course of their employment or consulting relationship. We also enter into nondisclosure agreements with our commercial counterparties and limit access to, and distribution of, our confidential information.
We are committed to developing and protecting our intellectual property and, where appropriate, file patent applications to protect our technology. Our existing patents expire between 2020 and 2035. Our present and future patents may provide only limited protection for our technology and may not be sufficient to provide competitive advantages to us. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights. Competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technology we offer in our products and services. 
We hold a number of registered and unregistered trademarks, service names and domain names that are used in our business in the United States.
Competition
The mortgage origination software market is highly competitive. There are many software providers catering to mortgage brokerages and mortgage lenders. Our current principal software competitors include: Byte Software Inc., a subsidiary of CBCInnovis; Calyx Technology, Inc.; DH Corporation; LendingQB, Mortgage Builder Software, Inc., a subsidiary of Altisource Portfolio Solutions SA; Mortgage Cadence, which is owned by Accenture PLC; Wipro Gallagher Solutions, which is owned by Wipro, Ltd. and LoanSphere Empower and LoanSphere LendingSpace, which are owned by Black Knight Financial Services, Inc. Some of these software providers, including Calyx Technology, Inc. and Black Knight Financial Services, Inc., also provide connectivity between their software users and lenders and service providers.

 Competition with Software Providers
We compete against software providers based on our ability to provide:

• | a comprehensive, integrated software solution that provides all business-critical functions including customer acquisition, loan processing, task management, communication with borrowers and other mortgage origination participants, reporting, regulatory compliance, and general enterprise management;


• | solutions that create efficiencies in gathering, reviewing, and verifying mortgage-related data and producing accurate documentation;


• | on-demand solutions that reduce the need for IT infrastructure and overhead while providing the ability to update capabilities and adopt new regulations in a timely manner;


• | customizable business rules to automate processes, promote accountability, and enforce business practices that help assure loan quality and regulatory compliance;


• | a database architecture designed to reduce data errors and facilitate collaboration among departments within a mortgage origination company and comprehensive monitoring of the business of the entire enterprise;


• | attractive pricing options, such as our Success Based Pricing model, allowing customers to time payments to cash flow;


• | an integrated network to submit loan files electronically and securely to lenders and electronically order all of the services necessary to originate a loan;


• | a solution that is secure and maintains the confidentiality of our customers’ data; and


• | a solution that is reliable with minimal planned and unplanned downtime.

Competition with Service Providers
With the exception of our Encompass Compliance Service, Encompass CRM, and AllRegs, we only offer our other Encompass software services to Encompass users. There are many other service providers that also offer our Encompass users competing software services, including:
Borrower-facing Websites. We compete against providers of borrower-facing websites for mortgage originators, including: D+H Corporation; Blue Igloo, Inc. (dba Roostify), and new entrants to our space.
Document Preparation Services. We compete against document preparation service providers, including: DigitalDocs, Inc.; DocMagic Inc.; LenderLive Network, Inc.; MRG Document Technologies; Mortgage Banking Systems, Inc. (dba ProClose), owned by LogicEase Solutions Inc.; and Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc.
Compliance Services. We compete against compliance software service providers, including: Interthinx, Inc., a subsidiary of First American Financial Corporation; ComplianceEase, owned by LogicEase Solutions Inc.; and Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc.
Product and Pricing Services. We compete against product and pricing service providers, including: Insight Lending Solutions, Inc.; Mortech, Inc., a Zillow business; LoanLogics formerly NYLX, Inc.; and Optimal Blue, LLC. 
Electronic Document Management. We compete against electronic document management providers, including: Encomia LP; SigniaDocs, Inc.; VirPack Corporation; and Xerox Mortgage Services, Inc.
We compete against these providers not only based on the quality of the service we offer, but also on the integration of each specific service provided within Encompass’s overall workflow. We believe that the integration of the services with Encompass enhances mortgage originators’ control over the mortgage origination process and reduces errors and costs through the seamless exchange of data across applications and services.
Competition Regarding the Ellie Mae Network
The Ellie Mae Network is only available to mortgage originators using Encompass. The principal competition to the use of the Ellie Mae Network remains traditional methods of exchanging data and documents among mortgage industry participants by email, facsimile, phone, courier, and mail. In addition, mortgage originators may use a standalone web browser to go individually to each investor, lender, or service provider’s website and then manually upload loan data or enter information into the website. Mortgage originators may continue to use these methods due to habit, personal business relationships or for other reasons, despite the disadvantages of duplicative efforts, time delays, errors and costs, redundant paper documentation, and potential privacy and security breaches.

Lenders and service providers, including those who participate on the Ellie Mae Network, can and do connect with mortgage originators that are not Encompass users in a variety of ways, including through other networks between mortgage originators and lenders and service providers such as Black Knight Financial Services, Inc.
We compete with respect to the Ellie Mae Network based on offering mortgage originators accessibility to a critical mass of investors, lenders, and service providers, and enabling mortgage originators to transact all aspects of the mortgage origination process over the network. In addition, we compete with respect to the Ellie Mae Network by providing investors, lenders, and service providers with superior technological connectivity with mortgage originators, which enables them to lower costs, reduce errors and increase speed.
We believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors; however, some of our actual and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages over us, such as longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources.
Government Regulation
The U.S. mortgage industry is heavily regulated. Mortgage originators, lenders, investors, and service providers with which we do business are subject to federal, state, and local laws that regulate and restrict the manner in which they operate in the residential mortgage industry, including Regulation X of RESPA, Regulation Z of TILA, the Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act, and the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, as amended. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act increased regulation of the mortgage industry, including: generally prohibiting lenders from making residential mortgage loans unless a good faith determination is made of a borrower’s creditworthiness based on verified and documented information; requiring the CFPB to enact regulations to help assure that consumers are provided with timely and understandable information about residential mortgage loans that protect them against unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices; and requiring federal regulators to establish minimum national underwriting guidelines for residential mortgages that lenders will be allowed to securitize and sell to third-party investors without retaining any of the loans’ default risk. Although we are not directly subject to these laws and regulations, changes to these laws and regulations could broaden the scope of parties or activities subject to regulation and require us to comply with their restrictions, and new products and services developed by us may be subject to, or have to reflect, these laws or regulations.
In addition, we are subject to general business laws and regulations, regulations governing federal contractors, and laws and regulations specifically governing the Internet, such as those covering taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access, and the characteristics and quality of services.
Employees
At December 31, 2016, we had 1,069 full-time employees, including 171 in sales and marketing, 767 in research and development and technology, and 131 in general and administrative functions. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters are located in Pleasanton, California, totaling approximately 280,680 square feet, under a lease expiring in December 2025. We also have staff operating in branch offices in Calabasas, California; Irvine, California; San Diego, California; Eagan, Minnesota; St. Louis, Missouri; Omaha, Nebraska; and Parsippany, New Jersey.
