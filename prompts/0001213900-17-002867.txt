History and Organizational Structure
 
China Auto Logistics Inc. was incorporated on February 22, 2005 in the State of Nevada.
 
On November 10, 2008, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Ever Auspicious International Limited, a Hong Kong company (“HKCo”) and Bright Praise Enterprises Limited, a British Virgin Islands company and the sole shareholder of HKCo, pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of HKCo, from Bright Praise Enterprises Limited in exchange for approximately 64.64% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock (the “Exchange”). As a result of the Exchange, HKCo became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary. The Company’s primary business operations became those of HKCo.
 
On October 17, 2007, Ever Auspicious International Limited, a Hong Kong company (“HKCo”) was incorporated in Hong Kong to act as a holding company for Shisheng. On November 1, 2007, HKCo entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Cheng Weihong, Xia Qiming, and Qian Yuxi (collectively, the “Sellers”), pursuant to which the Sellers transferred their interest in Shisheng to HKCo for an aggregate purchase price of $12,067,254 (RMB95,000,000). As a result of this transaction, HKCo owns all of the capital stock of Shisheng.
 
In September 1995, Shisheng was founded by Mr. Tong Shiping and his family as a private company under the name “Tianjin Tariff-Free Zone Shisheng Property Management Corp.”, which was subsequently renamed as Tianjin Seashore New District Shisheng Business Trading Group Co. Ltd. Its core business was selling the domestically manufactured automobile model CHARADE, which had 10% of the automobile market share in China between 1995 and 2000. With the increased popularity of imported cars and the maturation of the internet, Shisheng switched its core business to the sale of imported automobiles. Shisheng owns 98% of Tianjin Ganghui Information Technology Corp., which is currently inactive, and 98% of Tianjin Hengjia Port Logistics Corp., which provides web-based, real-time information on imported automobiles and automobile value added services to wholesalers and distributors in the imported vehicle sales and trading industry, such as customs clearance and arrangement for import good storage.

On September 23, 2015, the Company sold its 98% equity interest in Zhengji International Trading Corp. (“Zhengji”), which was owned by Shisheng and was engaged in automobile sales, to Mr. Wu Xiang Yang, an unrelated party, at a price of $3,048,483 (net of cash of $7,408 at Zhengji and amount due to Zhengji of $5,231,941). Zhengji’s assets consisted of automobile inventories of $3,422,658, other assets of $12,493 and other current liabilities of $2,329 on the disposal date resulting in a loss on sale of equity interest in subsidiary in the amount of $210,895 after consideration of the non controlling interest of $173,444 in Zhengji. Zhengji had no material operations during 2015 through the disposal date.
 
On June 1, 2016, Shisheng entered into (i) an Equity Transfer Agreement (“Equity Transfer Agreement”) with Wuxi Huitong Automobile Sales and Service Co., Ltd. (“Huitong”) to sell 100% of the equity of Tianjin Zhonghe Auto Sales Service Co., Ltd. (“Zhonghe”), our former wholly owned subsidiary acquired in November 2013, and (ii) a Debt Transfer Agreement, by and among Shisheng, Huitong, and Hezhong (Tianjin) International Development Co., Ltd. (“Hezhong”) (the “Debt Transfer Agreement”). At the time, Zhonghe was the owner and operator of the Airport International Automall located in the Tianjin Airport Economic Area and the 40% owner of Car King Tianjin. Under the terms of the Equity Transfer Agreement, the sale price for the Zhonghe equity was approximately $61.7 million (RMB 410,000,000). The sale price was payable in two parts: (i) Huitong paid Shisheng approximately $25.6 million (RMB 169,938,192) in cash and (ii) under the terms of the Debt Transfer Agreement, Huitong assumed Shisheng’s outstanding payment obligations to Hezhong of $36.1 million (RMB 240,061,808) under the Equity Transfer Agreement, dated November 30, 2013, by and between Hezhong and Shisheng. Upon signing, Shisheng transferred control of Zhonghe to Huitong. Upon the completion of this transaction, the Company relinquished ownership of the Airport International Automall property and its 40% ownership of Car King Tianjin. Zhonghe operated in two segments, Sales of Automobiles and Airport Automall Automotive Services. As a result of the sale of Zhonghe, the airport automall automotive services unit has been discontinued.
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company conducts its business through the following wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries of the Company:
 

● | Ever Auspicious International Limited, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Tianjin Seashore New District Shisheng Business Trading Group Co. Ltd. 
● | Tianjin Ganghui Information Technology Corp. 
● | Tianjin Hengjia Port Logistics Corp. 

Industry Overview
 
China’s auto industry growth has been driven by rising domestic demand stemming from rising incomes and expanding middle and upper-middle classes. For the middle and upper-middle classes, automobiles serve not only as modes of transportation but also as status symbols. As a result, imported automobiles, particularly luxury automobiles like Audi, Mercedes Benz, BMW, Lexus and Land Rover, are in high demand. The expansion of China’s roads and highway network, coupled with the expanding middle and upper-middle classes, are expected to lead to robust auto sales in the years to come.

In November 2001, China became a member of the World Trade Organization (the “WTO”). Due to the Chinese government’s trade restrictions, imported automobiles did not flood into the Chinese market, thereby creating an opportunity for the development and growth of the domestic automobile manufacturing industry. The result has been a steady increase in the sales of Chinese manufactured automobiles, not only to the domestic market, but also into the international market.
 
In August 2014, the China Commerce and Industry Bureau authorized the “Parallel Imported Vehicles” scheme. “Parallel Imported Vehicles” scheme permits foreign made automobiles to be imported by importers in addition to authorized automobile dealers. This policy officially opened the imported automobile market to importers like us, so that we can now be in direct competition with the authorized dealers. This is an antitrust effort by the Chinese government to address complaints about the authorized automobile dealers overcharging for foreign-made automobiles. These new rules will also officially allow imported automobiles sold by parties other than authorized dealers to be treated the same as those sold through authorized dealers (i.e., with respect to insurance coverage and the registration process). So far, Shanghai and Beijing have implemented this “Parallel Imported Vehicles” scheme. There are three major advantages of the Parallel Imported Vehicles over the imported vehicles sold by the authorized automobiles dealers. First, there is a price advantage for Parallel Imported Vehicles as there are several layers of distributorships for vehicles sold through authorized dealers. Second, due to the process time needed to approve new models of imported vehicles, the Parallel Imported Vehicles scheme allows the new models of imported vehicles become available earlier than those sold through the authorized dealers. Third, the Parallel Imported Vehicles scheme allows the importers to import limited edition vehicles, which are generally unavailable from the authorized dealers and provided more selections of vehicles to the consumers. According to data issued by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (“CAAM”) on February 9, 2017, approximately 1.04 million automobiles were imported to China in 2016, a decline of 3.4% compared to 2015. Such decline was much smaller than the 2015 decline of 24.2% compared to 2014. In addition, according to the data published by CAAM, the number of imported automobiles sold through Parallel Imported Vehicles scheme totaled approximately 130,290 units, which represents 12.8% of total imported automobiles sold in 2016, an 16.3% increase from 2015. We expect the “Parallel Imported Vehicles” scheme will continue to create long term benefits for our business.
 
China experienced significant economic growth and overtook the US as the world’s largest automobile market. According to the article “2016 Chinese Automobile Sales ranked No. 1 in eight Consecutive Years” published by Xinhuanet.com, “Chinese automobile production and sales show accelerated growth and hit record high again in 2016. Automobile production and sales reached 28.1 million units and 28 million units, respectively, in 2016, a growth of 14.5% and 13.7%, respectively, compared to 2015.”
 
As of December 31, 2016, eight cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Guiyang, Shenzhen, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin and Hangzhou, are subject to restrictions on automobile purchases. The restrictions vary from city to city, however most of these cities set an annual limit on the maximum number of vehicles in each category that may be licensed, in order to limit the number of new vehicles added to the roads each year. Some cities, such as Beijing, have adopted a lottery system wherein only potential buyers who win the lottery draw will be able to purchase vehicles. As more cities become subject to these and similar purchase restrictions, the future growth in the automobile market in China will be negatively impacted.
 
Our Competitive Strengths 
 
We are committed to keeping our competitive edge by constantly evaluating and responding to market demand and providing new products and services. Our goals are to establish successful and long-term partnerships with our customers, employees and suppliers and to provide high quality services and products. In particular, we believe the following strengths differentiate our business:

● | We are headquartered in Tianjin, which is the largest port city among the top 5 port cities in China for imported automobiles. Tianjin has a strong established presence in the imported automobile market in China, which provides us with first-hand knowledge of product information and developing industry trends. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | We have a unique business model that combines Sales of Automobiles, Financing Services, and other automotive related services which enhances our ability to be a one-stop service provider for most of our customers’ needs with respect to imported automobiles and used automobiles in the PRC. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are one of the leaders in the “parallel import automobiles” industry in Tianjin which allows us to maintain competitive advantages by offering substantially more automobile models for our customers to choose from and best available prices. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have continued to grow and maintain a referral network with all major automobile distributors and agents in the PRC. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We maintain close relationships with many major commercial banks in the PRC, including the Agricultural Bank of China, China Merchants Bank, PuDong Development Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China ZheShang Bank, China Minsheng Bank, and Shengjing Bank, which gives us a competitive advantage over our competitors in providing Financing Services. As of March 22, 2017, the Company had aggregate credit lines of $125 million (RMB870 million) with its banks. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our key personnel each have more than fifteen years of Chinese automobile industry experience. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy
 
We intend to pursue the following key elements to our growth strategy:
 

● | Create New Services. We are looking into developing an internet based platform which matches the buyers and the sellers for various automobile related services. If successful, we expect this platform will change the way imported automobiles are sold and related services are provided in China. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Emphasize Service and Support. We will continue to build on our menu of established business offerings as a clear and viable alternative to price-only selling. We will also aim to expand our existing banking relationships and explore other cooperative relationships with major commercial banks to increase our lines of credit to provide additional Financing Services to our customers. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Build a Relationship-Oriented Business. We have a history of building long-term relationships with clients rather than focusing on single-transactions. To that end, we aim to capitalize on our existing client base by establishing a national automobile dealer network for faster information exchange and closer coordination. We will also continue to place an emphasis on obtaining authorized agent licenses with large international automobile manufacturers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Build Brand Recognition. We will build brand name recognition through diverse marketing channels such as online advertising, public relations and trade-show participation.

Our Business Lines and Products
 
Sale of Automobiles
 
We conduct our sales operations of imported automobiles through Shisheng. We are a general agent and wholesaler authorized by the Chinese government to import vehicles into the PRC. We sell our vehicles to authorized dealers like Ford or Lexus, as they are not able to import all models directly, free traders or wholesalers located in inland China or non-port cities, and individual customers. We have the core competencies within our network to sell all makes and models of imported vehicles. Our sales network penetrates to agents and dealers in more than 100 cities. We have close working relationships with some of the largest automobile dealers in China.
 
Our revenues from the sale of imported automobiles and related activities were $581.2 million for fiscal year 2012 (98.30% of all revenues), $450.1 for the fiscal year 2013 (98.03%), $393.7 million for fiscal year 2014 (97.86% of all revenues), $440.7 million for fiscal year 2015 (98.74% of all revenues), and $462.7 million for fiscal 2016 (99.07% of all revenues) representing a 5% increase from the prior fiscal year.

Financing Services
 
Many of our customers, including both authorized agents and general dealers, contend with a shortage of working capital. The imported automobile service industry has developed to address these barriers by providing short-term financing services in connection with the importation of automobiles. These service providers are located in the port cities of Dalin, Tianjin, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
 
Our Financing Services include letter of credit issuance services, purchase deposit financing, and import duty advance services. Our competitive advantage comes from relationships with major Chinese commercial banks, including China Merchants Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, PuDong Development Bank, China ZheShang Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Minsheng Bank, and Shengjing Bank. As of March 22, 2017, the Company had aggregate credit lines of $125 million (RMB870 million) with its banks. We are currently negotiating a number of new credit lines with various banks and the Company is optimistic that it will be able to obtain financing on an as-needed basis that will be sufficient for us to provide Financing Services to our customers.
 
The Company provides Financing Services to its customers using its facility lines of credit with its banks. The Company earns a service fee for the customers drawing its facility lines related to their purchases of automobiles and payment of import taxes. The customers bear all the interest and fees charged by the banks and prepay such amounts upon the execution of their service contracts with the Company. The customers are also required to make a deposit in the range of 10% to 15% of the purchase price of the automobile with the Company. The banks are granted a security interest in automobiles until the borrowings are fully paid.
 
Our revenues from Financing Services were $7,085,357 for fiscal year 2012 (1.20% of total revenues), $6,893,985 for fiscal year 2013 (1.50% of total revenues), and $7,403,202 for fiscal year 2014 (1.84% of total revenues), $5,567,208 for fiscal year 2015 (1.25%), and $4,314,291 for fiscal year 2016 (0.92%), representing a decrease of 22.51% from the prior fiscal year.
 
Other Services
 
Web-based Advertising Services
 
We have experienced strong competition in the web-based advertising arena which continues to drive the pricing of advertising revenue down. Starting in 2012, we began to shift our focus of our websites from generating advertising revenue to providing automotive information to our website visitors. We are targeting to create a platform which allows our customers and potential customers to have access to our products including automobile sales, Automobile Valued Added Services and Financing Services. Through offering extensive automotive information and news, we hope to attract more potential customers to visit our websites. We believe our business strategy of using our websites as a platform to expand our reach to our customers and potential customers will benefit us in the long term.

www.at188.com - Imported Automobiles Under the “Parallel Imported Vehicles” scheme
 
With the continuous development of network technology and the growing popularization of the Internet, value-added Internet-based businesses are experiencing rapid growth in China. Accompanying the growth of the automobile markets in China, there is a strong demand for timely information regarding demand changes, market status and competitors’ quotations. www.at188.com was established by the Company in August 2000 to provide subscribers easily accessible and accurate sales and trading information about imported automobiles. In addition to imported automobile sales and trading and new model information, www.at188.com also provides parts and components information. After years of development and operation, www.at188.com has linked automobile wholesalers and retailers in China and also cooperates with major media outlets such as newspapers and television and radio stations in major cities in China.
 
www.at188.com charges subscribers an annual membership fee and generates revenue from on-line advertisements and web-based listing services, in addition to subscription revenues.
 
www.at160.com (formerly www.1365car.tj.cn) - Domestic and Imported Automobiles Through “4S” Shops
 
To provide real-time price comparison and sales and trading information directly to the domestic automobile market, we launched the website www.at160.com, formerly www.1365car.tj.cn, in 2005. This website is a platform that connects manufacturers, regional distributors and end users of domestically manufactured cars, providing them with a compelling source of information about domestic vehicles and serving as a timelier alternative to traditional magazines and television. www.at160.com currently provides real-time price comparison and sales and trading information in the PRC markets with respect to domestically manufactured automobiles.
 
www.at160.com targets customers interested in purchasing vehicles, and it generates revenues from subscriptions and advertisements. Most domestic and imported automobile purchases are made from “4S” shops which offer sales, service, spare parts and survey.
 
Since 2012, due to our revised business plan focusing on imported automobiles and related services, we gradually moved away from promoting this website which provides information on the domestic automobile market. As a result, revenue generated from this website declined substantially starting in 2012, which decline has continued in 2016.
 
Our revenues from our websites were $819,344 for fiscal year 2012 (0.14% of all revenues), $471,277 for fiscal year 2013 (0.10% of all revenues), $242,250 for fiscal year 2014 (0.06% of all revenues), $48,755 for fiscal year 2015 (0.01% of all revenues) and $33,660 (0.01% of all revenues) representing a decrease of 31% from the prior fiscal year.
 
Other Services also include automobile value added services which generated no revenue during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 
Discontinued Operations - Airport Auto Mall Automotive Services
 
On June 1, 2016, Shisheng entered into (i) Equity Transfer Agreement with Huitong to sell 100% of the equity of Zhonghe, and (ii) Debt Transfer Agreement, by and among Shisheng, Huitong, and Hezhong. At the time, Zhonghe was the owner and operator of the Airport International Automall located in the Tianjin Airport Economic Area and the 40% owner of Car King Tianjin. Under the terms of the Equity Transfer Agreement, the sale price for the Zhonghe equity was approximately $61.7 million (RMB 410,000,000). The sale price was payable in two parts: (i) Huitong paid Shisheng approximately $25.6 million (RMB 169,938,192) in cash and (ii) under the terms of the Debt Transfer Agreement, Huitong assumed Shisheng’s outstanding payment obligations to Hezhong of $36.1 million (RMB 240,061,808) under the Equity Transfer Agreement, dated November 30, 2013, by and between Hezhong and Shisheng. Upon signing, Shisheng transferred control of Zhonghe to Huitong. Upon the completion of this transaction, the Company relinquished ownership of the Airport International Automall property and its 40% ownership of Car King Tianjin. Zhonghe operated in two segments, Sales of Automobiles and Airport Automall Automotive Services. As a result of the sale of Zhonghe, the airport automall automotive services unit has been discontinued.
Products Under Development
 
The further development of our websites may be an attractive means for us to develop our business due to the relatively low cost of operation, the global reach of the medium, and the security enhancements that have been and will be put in place. The business model could be expanded to combine Internet commerce and traditional sales. The success of the Internet business can help us build brand name recognition and awareness in the automobile sales and trading industry and increase our automobile sales volume. We continue to look into developing an internet based platform which matches the buyers and the sellers for various automobile related services. If successful, we expect this platform will change the way imported automobiles are sold and related services are provided in China.

We operate our domestic automobile website in the city of Tianjin. In response to the intensified competition in the online advertising markets in China and our revised plan of focusing our business on imported automobiles and related services, we continue to focus our website portals’ geographical coverage on the city of Tianjin.
 
In the coming years, we will continue our attempt to shift the business focus of the Company from a traditional automobile trader to a more diversified automotive service provider. Although we expect sales of imported automobile to continue to represent a considerable percentage of our revenues, we expect the percentage of our net profit generated from imported automobile sales to be low. While we intend to maintain our position as one of the leading imported automobile traders in Tianjin, we do not anticipate that revenues generated by automobile sales will maintain the same growth rate as in the past. We expect the percentage of our net profits generated from Financing Services will continue to be a significant contributor to our gross profit.
 
Major Suppliers and Customers
 
We have stable relationships with both Chinese domestic and foreign automobile manufacturers. We derive a significant portion of our revenues on an aggregate basis from our top five customers, and we make a significant portion of our purchases from our top five suppliers. Sales to the Company’s top five customers, each of which is a car dealer, accounted for 42% and 34% of the Company’s net revenues during 2016 and 2015, respectively. Purchases from the Company’s top five suppliers accounted for 41% and 40% of the Company’s total net purchases during 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
The following table sets out our major customers who individually accounted for over 10% of our total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:
 

 | As a Percentage of Our Total Net Revenues | 
--------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+---
 | Fiscal Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2016 | | | 2015
Tianjin Jing Dian Automobile Sales Information Ltd. Co. | | 23 | % | | 25 | %
Tianjin Binhai International Automall Ltd. Co. | | 15 | % | | ** | 

 
The following table sets out our major suppliers who individually accounted for more than 10% of our total net purchases for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:
 

 | As a Percentage of Our Total Net Purchases | 
--------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+---
 | Fiscal Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2016 | | | 2015
Tianjin Shi Mao International International Trading Ltd. Co., | | 16 | % | | 18 | %
Tianjin Ying Zhi Jie International Logistics Ltd. Co., | | 12 | % | | 12 | %

 
** Accounted for less than 10% of our total net purchases.
 
Some of our clients are both our customers and suppliers. None of the activities transacted between the Company and clients who are both customers and suppliers involved any commitments between the parties to repurchase identical automobiles. We maintain close working relationships with our top customers and suppliers, although we also continue to diversify our customers and suppliers. We do not believe that the loss of any one major customer or supplier in and of itself would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We have long-term relationship with our major suppliers. Even though we do not foresee any interruption in our relationship with our suppliers in the near future, we believe that there are other suppliers available to supply automobiles to us at reasonable terms if we lose any of our major suppliers. The major customers and suppliers stated above guarantee certain of our borrowings with the banks.

Intellectual Property
 
Our websites, www.at188.com and www.at160.com, have registered domain names expiring in November 2021 and July 2019, respectively. These registrations, together with registrations for other sub-websites of the Company, will be renewed in the ordinary course of our business. The geographic focus of our website portals continues to be the city of Tianjin.
Competition and Pricing
 
Tianjin is a major entry port in China. Many of the vehicles imported into Tianjin are imported by general dealers such as Audi, Toyota, BMW, Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz. We purchase our inventory through our suppliers, who import vehicles directly from the foreign countries in which they are manufactured. Competition has increased in recent years due to an increase in the number of smaller shops entering this market. For the specialized services market related to Automobile Value Added Services and Financing Services, we believe we have secured a substantial share of the market for such services in Tianjin.
 
Competitive threats may come from any company that is able to provide the services offered by us at a lower price and better quality. We charge appropriately for the high-end, high-quality services and products we offer, and we do not aspire to be the lowest cost provider of our services. Rather, we aim to distinguish ourselves from our competitors by providing the highest value to our customers. However in recent years, due to strong competition from other importers and other authorized dealers, we have been forced to lower our prices in order to maintain our leadership position. Consequently our gross margin continues to decline, but we believe that our gross margin is at its lowest level, and we expect it to stay at the current level in the future quarters.
 
Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws; Government Regulation
 
Our products and operations are currently in compliance with all Chinese laws and environmental standards. We are not aware of any other governmental approvals required for any of our products or operations.
Research and Development
 
We spent $0 and $0 on research and development activities for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015, respectively. None of these costs were borne directly by our customers.
 
Employees 
 
We currently employ 40 employees, of which all are full-time employees. None of our employees are unionized.
 
Geographical Area of the Company’s Business
 
All of our revenue is derived from operations within the PRC, and all of our assets are located in the PRC. For risks relating to our operations in the PRC, see discussions in the section entitled “Risk Factors” below.
