Product marketing bridges our research and development organization and our sales staff to help ensure that our products meet the demands and requirements of our key customers and a broader market set of prospects for our HPC and big data business and our new business initiatives. Marketing communications focus on our overall brand messaging, advertising, public relations, social media, conferences, trade shows and direct as well as online marketing campaigns to create brand awareness and generate demand. Segment marketing focuses on providing products and services to specific customer sets, such as earth sciences, energy, financial services, manufacturing and life sciences.
Our Technology 
We are dependent on the successful early identification, development and timely introduction of new products and capabilities. Our research and development activities include identification of new trends, technologies and workload needs in the ever changing HPC and big data markets, and then leveraging this research in the design of system architectures, hardware and software necessary to implement our expanding product portfolio to address customer needs.
Product Architectures
Our product portfolio covers a breadth of architectures including tightly integrated massively parallel supercomputers, highly flexible and configurable cluster supercomputers, purpose-built big data analytics products and world class storage and data management solutions.
Hardware
We have extensive experience in the definition, design and integration of the hardware components required of HPC system solutions. This includes processors, board design, memory, storage, network and interconnect technologies, I/O subsystems, power, cooling and packaging infrastructures, along with the low-level hardware system software required to manage key components. The majority of our hardware research and development investments are in the following areas:

• | Compute and storage architectures, high-speed interconnect and board integration and design. Integration of a variety of processor, volatile and nonvolatile memory hierarchies and network devices using a combination of custom and industry standard printed circuit boards, high-density connectors, carefully chosen transmission and storage media and optimized topologies.

6


• | Power, packaging and cooling. We use a variety of dense packaging techniques in order to produce systems with superior performance, socket densities and energy efficiency. This packaging combines industry standard and custom-designed technologies in the areas of printed circuit board assemblies, power distribution and liquid and air cooling.

Software
We have extensive experience in designing, developing and adapting system software such as the operating system, system management, optimized data management, movement and analysis, as well as programming environment software as an integral aspect of our product portfolio and distributing that software as part of system sales. Our software research and development experience includes operating system optimizations and scalable hardware control, monitoring and management, including power control, monitoring of environmental data, and hardware diagnostics. Our integrated system software together provides Reliability, Availability and Serviceability, or RAS, for Cray systems. The Cray programming environment includes our own and commercially available third-party compilers, communication and scientific libraries as well as a rich suite of application development tools and software for achieving the best possible application performance. 
Additionally, we research innovative software for advanced analytics at scale, including industry leading graph analytics and associated algorithms for discovering previously unknown insights from large, disparate data sets, as well as optimizations to Hadoop and Spark for performance and manageability at scale. Our research includes techniques and optimizations to scale advanced analytics across distributed scalable systems, and in large, shared memory architectures.
When necessary, we purchase or license certain software and technologies from third parties to meet certain specific customer requirements, while focusing our own resources where we believe we add the highest value.
For information relating to amounts spent on research and development, see Note 18 - Research and Development in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K. 
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
We subcontract the manufacture of a majority of the hardware sub-assemblies and certain components for our high-end products and custom-engineered systems, including integrated circuits, printed circuit boards, connectors, cables and power supplies, on a sole or limited source basis to third-party suppliers. We use contract manufacturers to assemble certain components. Our manufacturing strategy currently centers on build-to-order systems, focusing on obtaining competitive assembly and component costs while concentrating our resources on the final assembly, test and quality assurance stages to ensure a positive customer experience. This strategy allows us to avoid the large capital commitment and overhead associated with establishing full-scale manufacturing facilities, helps us to maintain the flexibility to adopt new technologies as they become available without the risk of equipment obsolescence, provides near real-time configuration changes to exploit faster and/or less expensive technologies and provides a higher level of large scale system quality. We perform final system integration, testing and quality checkout of our systems. Our manufacturing personnel are located in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. We work closely with a supplier to provide integrated and tested Cray Sonexion storage products.
Our systems designed for the supercomputer market segment and our custom-engineered solutions incorporate components that are available from single or limited sources, often containing our design input or proprietary designs. Such components include integrated circuits, interconnect systems and certain memory devices. Prior to development of a particular product, components are typically competitively bid to a short list of technology partners. The technology partner that provides the highest value solution for the component is often awarded the contract for the life of the component. Once we have engaged a technology partner, changing our product designs to utilize another supplier’s integrated circuits or custom components can be a costly and time-consuming process. We also have sole or limited sources for less critical components, such as peripherals, power supplies, cooling and chassis hardware. We currently obtain key processors from Intel and NVIDIA for our Cray XC and cluster systems. We have a license for the Aries interconnect chip from Intel which we purchase through Broadcom Corporation (formerly Avago) that contracts with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for the manufacture of the integrated circuit. Our procurements from these vendors are primarily through purchase orders. We have chosen to deal with sole sources in specific cases due to the availability of specific technologies, economic advantages and other factors. Reliance on single or limited source vendors involves several risks, including the possibility of shortages of key components, long lead times, reduced control over delivery schedules, design or persistent quality issues and changes in direction by vendors. We have been adversely affected by delays in obtaining qualified competitive components previously.

Segment information and related disclosures are set forth in Note 17 — Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K. 
Competition
The broad HPC market is very competitive. We compete with systems builders and resellers of systems that are constructed from commodity components using processors manufactured by Intel, NVIDIA, AMD and others. IBM, NEC and Fujitsu also build systems leveraging their own processors. In addition, certain Chinese companies are investing significantly in HPC and are becoming more aggressive and \competitive in the HPC global arena. Our competitors include the previously named companies as well as smaller companies that assemble systems from commercially available commodity products. The Cray CS400 and CS-Storm supercomputing cluster products are designed to help us better address this market by providing flexible HPC offering alternatives with competitive pricing. To the extent that IBM and other processor suppliers develop processors or networks with greater capabilities or at lower cost than the processors we use from Intel and NVIDIA, our systems may be at a competitive disadvantage to systems utilizing such other processors.
For our products designed for the high-end supercomputer market segment, we compete primarily on the basis of product performance, scalability, breadth of features, price/performance, total cost of ownership, quality, reliability, upgradability, service and support, corporate reputation, brand image and account relationships. Our market approach here is more focused than many of our competitors, with high-end supercomputing products (the Cray XC series) designed with high levels of integration to meet the exacting needs of this performance and scalability driven market. We work to offer systems that provide greater performance on the largest, most difficult computational problems and superior price/performance on many important applications in the upper-end of the supercomputer market segment. Our highly-integrated systems often offer superior total cost of ownership advantages as they typically use less electric power, require less cooling and occupy less space than lower bandwidth cluster systems.
The market for our Cray CS400 product line is very competitive. The majority of competition is from Lenovo, HPE, Dell, Atos and Fujitsu, all of which offer open-standards cluster solutions to address the growth in the mid-range supercomputing market. We compete primarily on the basis of price/performance, open-standards architecture, flexible configurations, energy-efficiency, reliability, scalability, comprehensive cluster management, corporate reputation and account relationships. Our market approach is to offer cluster solutions that provide greater performance on the large and complex computational problems and superior price/performance on many important applications in this market segment.
The competitive landscape in the big data market is quite varied, with competition from vendors offering integrated solutions, such as Oracle, commodity cluster systems with either open source or proprietary data analytics software, and traditional business intelligence vendors such as Teradata, Oracle, IBM and SAP. The market for knowledge discovery through graph analytics is still nascent and fragmented as no dominant applications have yet emerged, with the result that custom and open source software approaches such as Hadoop/MapReduce are often used. However, customers with large, mission-critical graph problems have discovered that commodity approaches do not scale or deliver results in an acceptable timeframe, and have recognized the advantages of specialized solutions. We recently introduced the Cray Urika-GX offering, which competes primarily on the basis of performance, scalability and integration, as well as total cost of ownership in the traditional Hadoop and Spark analytics marketplace as well as for graph analytics. The artificial intelligence market is nascent outside of the large web companies but competition may include systems and subsystems developed by processor vendors and several start-up companies in addition to our traditional system competitors.
Our storage products compete with a number of manufacturers and integrators of parallel storage solutions, including IBM with its GPFS parallel file system, as well as solutions from Data Direct Networks, or DDN, NetApp, Dell/EMC and other storage companies. The parallel storage and file system market is currently fragmented with a number of competing providers in the HPC marketplace. We believe that our strong storage products, along with our extensive experience and excellent reputation as an HPC systems vendor, and our storage offerings compete effectively against our competition, especially when the prospective target market overlaps with our HPC systems target market.

Intellectual Property
We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights through formal agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and consultants, and through patent protection. Although we intend to protect our rights vigorously, there can be no assurance that our contractual and other security arrangements will be successful.
Our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements that give us a competitive advantage and are likely to be incorporated into our products and services. We have a number of patents and pending patent applications relating to our hardware and software technologies. While we believe our patents and applications have value, no single patent or group of patents is in itself essential to us as a whole or to any of our key products. Any of our proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and may not provide significant competitive advantage.
We have licensed certain patents and other intellectual property from others in our industry. These licenses often contain restrictions on our use of the underlying technology. We have also entered into cross-license arrangements with other companies involved in the HPC industry. 
Backlog
We do not believe backlog is a meaningful indicator of our future business prospects due to the uncertainty of converting orders into recognized revenue in any given period. Judgments about contracts not yet signed and open opportunities are often more important. Factors impacting the amount of backlog and our ability to recognize revenue from backlog in any given period include the possibility of significant contract amendments, the timing of our product development, manufacturing and delivery schedules and changes in delivery schedules requested by our customers. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,312 employees. We have no collective bargaining agreement with our employees. We have not experienced a work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are very good.
