  Overview
 We were formed in 2005 as a Delaware limited liability company until our conversion in 2015 into a Delaware limited partnership.  We are a growth-oriented publicly-traded limited partnership focused on the acquisition, development, ownership and operation of midstream and other energy-related assets in North America.  The Partnership has ownership stakes in oil and natural gas gathering systems, natural gas pipelines, and a natural gas processing facility, all located in the Western Eagle Ford in South Texas. Our assets include a gathering system on the Western portion of the Catarina asset operated by Sanchez Energy in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas (“Western Catarina Midstream”), our wholly owned SECO Pipeline (defined below), a 50% interest in a gathering system that connects to Western Catarina Midstream (the Carnero Gathering Line, defined below), a 50% interest in a cryogenic natural gas processing plant (the Raptor Gas Processing Facility, defined below), and reversionary working interests and other production assets in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma.    Our common units are currently listed on the NYSE American under the symbol “SNMP.” Our Relationship with Sanchez Energy, Manager and SOG
 We believe that our relationship with Sanchez Energy provides us with a strategic advantage and will continue to provide us with significant growth opportunities. As of March 6, 2018, Sanchez Energy owned approximately 15.2% of our outstanding common units.  Since March 2015, we have completed three midstream asset acquisitions and two working interest acquisitions from Sanchez Energy.  Pursuant to a right-of-first-offer, Sanchez Energy has agreed to offer us the right to acquire any midstream assets that it desires to sell.  However, Sanchez Energy is under no obligation to sell any assets to us or to accept any offer for its assets that we may choose to make. 
 We have entered into a shared services agreement with Manager, pursuant to which Manager provides services that we require to operate our business, including overhead, technical, administrative, marketing, accounting, operational, information systems, financial, compliance, insurance, acquisition, disposition and financing services (the “Services Agreement”). Manager in turn has a shared services agreement in place with SOG. SOG also has a shared services agreement in place with Sanchez Energy. We believe that our relationships with Manager and SOG provide us with competitive advantages, including a cost-efficient means of operating our assets.  Manager is the sole member of our general partner and has an interest in us through its ownership of all of our incentive distribution rights. Manager and SOG provide services that we require to operate our business, including overhead, technical, administrative, marketing, accounting, operational, information systems, financial, compliance, insurance, acquisition, disposition and financing services.  SOG has a senior management team that averages over 20 years of industry experience and employs over 312 full-time employees, including approximately 67 technical staff and engineers. SOG was formed in 1972 and has drilled or participated in over 4,000 wells, directly and through joint ventures, and has successfully built and operated extensive midstream and gathering assets associated with its exploration and production assets.  We plan on leveraging SOG’s extensive expertise and experience to execute on our business strategies.  While we believe that our relationships with Sanchez Energy, Manager and SOG are a significant strength, they are also a source of potential risks and conflicts.  Please read “Item 1A.  Risk Factors.”

  For information about our segments’ revenues, profits and losses and total assets, see Note 17. “Reporting Segments” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Midstream Business
 Western Catarina Midstream
 In October 2015, we acquired from Sanchez Energy a gathering system (“Western Catarina Midstream”), which is located on the western portion of Sanchez Energy’s approximately 106,000 net acres in Dimmit, LaSalle and Webb Counties, Texas (such net acreage collectively “Sanchez Energy’s Catarina Asset” and the western portion of such net acreage “Western Catarina”). The gathering system consists of gathering assets, pipelines, processing units, compression units and other related assets in Western Catarina, which are located in Dimmit and Webb Counties, Texas and service upstream production from the Eagle Ford Shale. Western Catarina Midstream consists of approximately 150 miles of gathering pipelines, four main gathering and processing facilities, including stabilizers, storage tanks, compressors and dehydration units, and other related assets in Western Catarina, which are located in Dimmit and Webb Counties, Texas, and services upstream production from the Eagle Ford Shale.  The gathering pipelines range in diameter from 4 to 12 inches, with capacity of 200 MMcf/d for natural gas, and 40 MBbl/d for crude oil and NGLs.  There are four main gathering and processing facilities, which include eight stabilizers of 5,000 barrels per day, approximately 25,000 barrels of storage capacity, pressurized storage for NGLs, approximately 18,000 horsepower of compression and approximately 300 MMcf/d of dehydration capacity. The gathering system is currently used solely to support the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas, NGLs and oil produced by Sanchez Energy at Sanchez Energy’s Catarina Asset. The gathering system has oil interconnects with the Plains All American Pipeline header system delivered to the Gardendale terminal, and to all four takeaway pipelines to Corpus Christi, and it has natural gas interconnects with Southcross Energy Partners, L.P., Kinder Morgan Inc., Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. and Transwestern Pipeline Company, LLC.  Pipeline capacity on Western Catarina Midstream can be expanded through small compression projects at a nominal cost, with approximately $1.0 million in capital expenditures planned per year.
 In conjunction with the acquisition of Western Catarina Midstream, we entered into the 15-year gas gathering agreement with Sanchez Energy pursuant to which Sanchez Energy agreed to tender all of its crude petroleum, natural gas and other hydrocarbon-based product volumes on approximately 35,000 dedicated acres in Western Catarina for processing and transportation through Western Catarina Midstream, with the potential to tender additional volumes outside of the dedicated acreage (the “Gathering Agreement”).
 All of the revenues from Western Catarina Midstream are currently earned from Sanchez Energy. Pursuant to the Gathering Agreement, Sanchez Energy has agreed to tender all of its oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbon-based product volumes on approximately 35,000 dedicated acres in Western Catarina for processing and transportation through Western

Catarina Midstream, with the potential to tender additional volumes from production activities outside of the dedicated acreage.  During the first five years of the contract term (or through 2020), Sanchez Energy is required to meet a minimum quarterly volume delivery commitment for oil and natural gas, subject to certain adjustments.  In addition, Sanchez Energy is required to pay contractually agreed upon gathering and processing fees for oil and natural gas volumes tendered through Western Catarina Midstream. In June 2017, the Gathering Agreement with Sanchez Energy was amended to add an incremental infrastructure fee to be paid by SN Catarina based on water that is delivered through the gathering system through March 31, 2018.
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, Sanchez Energy transported average daily production through the gathering system of approximately 11.6 MBbl/d of oil, 163.9 MMcf/d of natural gas and 12.2 MBbls/d of water.  The average age of the Western Catarina Midstream assets is approximately 7 years, and they have an average expected life of approximately 23 more years. 
 Carnero Gathering
 In July 2016, we acquired from Sanchez Energy a 50% interest in Carnero Gathering, a joint venture that is 50% owned and operated by Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE: TRGP) (“Targa”), for an initial payment of approximately $37.0 million and the assumption of remaining capital commitments to Carnero Gathering, estimated at approximately $7.4 million as of the acquisition date (the “Carnero Gathering Transaction”).  In addition, we are required to pay Sanchez Energy an earnout based on natural gas received above a threshold volume and tariff at Carnero Gathering’s delivery points from Sanchez Energy and other producers.  Carnero Gathering owns a total of approximately 45 miles of high pressure natural gas gathering pipelines that currently connect Western Catarina Midstream to nearby pipelines and the Raptor Gas Processing Facility in South Texas (the “Carnero Gathering Line”). Sanchez Energy has entered into a 15-year gathering agreement with Carnero Gathering pursuant to which Sanchez Energy is required to maintain a minimum quarterly volume delivery commitment for the first five years after the Raptor Gas Processing Facility’s in-service date of May 2017. Carnero Processing
 In November 2016, we acquired from Sanchez Energy a 50% interest in Carnero Processing, a joint venture that is 50% owned and operated by Targa, for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $55.5 million and the assumption of remaining capital contribution commitments to Carnero Processing, estimated at approximately $24.5 million as of the date of acquisition. Carnero Processing owns a 260 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant in La Salle County, Texas (the “Raptor Gas Processing Facility”). The Raptor Gas Processing Facility is a strategic asset that we believe will allow us to capture more of the value chain from Sanchez Energy's South Texas production and realize further upside from third party volumes.

 SECO Pipeline

In August 2017, we completed construction of a 100% owned and operated 30 mile natural gas pipeline with 400 MMcf/d capacity that is designed and used to transport dry gas from the Raptor Gas Processing Facility to multiple markets in South Texas (the “SECO Pipeline”). The SECO Pipeline provides E&P producers with optionality to southern gas markets and creates the potential to export natural gas to premium priced markets in Mexico. On September 1, 2017, we entered into an agreement with SN Catarina to transport certain quantities of SN Catarina’s natural gas on a firm basis through the SECO Pipeline for $0.22 per MMBtu delivered on or after September 1, 2017 (the “SECO Pipeline Transportation Agreement”). The SECO Pipeline Transportation Agreement continues on a month-to-month basis until terminated by either party. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Sanchez Energy transported average daily production through SECO Pipeline of approximately 61.1 MMcf/d of natural gas. The SECO Pipeline has an expected life of approximately 40 years.
 Title to Properties
 Title to the Western Catarina Midstream and the SECO Pipeline assets are either owned in fee or derived from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities, permitting the use of such land for our operations.  We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or license that is held by us or to the title to any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or lease we own, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of the material leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses with respect to all Western Catarina Midstream and SECO Pipeline assets. Production Business
 Our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2017, were approximately 5.3 MMBoe, approximately 100% of which were classified as proved developed, with 21% being natural gas, 17% being NGLs, and 62% being oil. At December 31, 2017, we owned approximately 57 net producing wells. Our total average proved reserve-to-production ratio is approximately 9.0 years and our portfolio decline rate is 11% to 20% based on our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2017.
 Below is a description of our operations and our oil and natural gas properties by basin at December 31, 2017:
 Locations
     Of our reserves, 89% were located in the Eagle Ford Shale on non-operated properties, where production during the year ended December 31, 2017 was 489.9 MBoe and approximately 4,707.7 MBoe of estimated proved reserves were held at December 31, 2017. All of these reserves were classified as proved developed, with 17% being natural gas, 16% being NGLs, and 67% being oil.
     The remaining reserves are located on non-operated properties in Oklahoma and Louisiana. During the year ended December 31, 2017, production on Oklahoma properties was 53.4 MBoe, and approximately 472.1 MBoe of estimated proved reserves were held at December 31, 2017, all of which were classified as proved developed, with 69% being natural gas and 31% being NGLs. During the year ended December 31, 2017, production on Louisiana properties was 19.6 MBoe, and approximately 85.6 MBoe of estimated proved reserves were held at December 31, 2017, all of which were classified as proved developed with 100% being oil.
     Operations
     We no longer operate any of our oil and gas properties. The Eagle Ford Shale properties are operated by SOG and Marathon Oil Company. The Gulf Coast properties are operated primarily by SOG, and the Oklahoma properties are operated primarily by LINN Energy.

 Production Divestitures
     Texas Production Divestiture
 In October 2017, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell specified oil and gas wells, leases and other associated assets and interests located in Texas (the “Texas Production Assets”) for cash consideration of approximately $6.3 million, subject to adjustment for title and environmental defects (the “Texas Production Divestiture”).  In addition, the buyer agreed to assume all obligations relating to the assets, including all plugging and abandonment costs relating to the assets, that arise on or after October 1, 2017.  The Texas Production Divestiture closed November 13, 2017, and we recorded a gain of approximately $1.4 million on the sale during the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-Operated Production Divestiture
 In July 2017, we entered into an agreement to assign certain non-operated production assets located in Oklahoma, as well as our equity interests in the entities that owned the assets, in exchange for agreeing upon the apportionment of certain shared litigation costs. The assignment was effective as of July 14, 2017. Oklahoma Production Divestiture
 In May 2017, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell all of the Partnership’s equity interests in the entities that owned our remaining Oklahoma production assets for cash consideration of $5.5 million, and assumption by the buyer of all obligations relating to the assets arising after the closing date and all plugging and abandonment costs relating to the assets arising prior to the closing date (the “Oklahoma Production Divestiture”).  The Oklahoma Production Divestiture closed July 17, 2017 and we recorded a gain of $2.4 million on the sale during the third quarter of 2017.
 Mid-Continent Divestiture
 In June 2016, certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Partnership entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of our operated oil and natural gas wells, leases and other associated assets and interests in Oklahoma and Kansas (other than those arising under or related to a concession agreement with the Osage Nation) (the “Mid-Continent Divestiture”) for cash consideration of $7,120, effective as of August 1, 2016 (the “Effective Time”).  In addition, the buyer agreed to assume all obligations relating to the assets arising after the Effective Time and all plugging and abandonment costs relating to the assets arising prior to the Effective Time. The sale closed on July 15, 2016, and we recorded a $0.2 million loss related to an intangible asset balance comprised of marketing contracts from a 2007 acquisition which were included in the Mid-Continent Divestiture.

 Proved Reserves of Natural Gas, NGLs, and Oil
 The following table reflects our estimates for proved natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves based on the SEC definitions that were used to prepare our financial statements for the periods presented.  The standardized measure values shown in the table are not intended to represent the current market values of our estimated proved reserves.
Reserve data: | 2017 | | 2016
Estimated proved reserves: | | | | | 
Oil (MMBbl) | | 3.3 | | | 3.5 
Natural gas (MMcf) | | 6.7 | | | 14.7
NGLs (MMBbl) | | 0.9 | | | 0.9 
Total proved reserves (MMBoe) | | 5.3 | | | 6.9 
Estimated proved developed reserves: | | | | | 
Oil (MMBbl) | | 3.3 | | | 3.5 
Natural gas (MMcf) | | 6.7 | | | 14.6
NGLs (MMBbl) | | 0.9 | | | 0.9 
Total proved developed reserves (MMBoe) | | 5.3 | | | 6.8 
Proved developed reserves as a percent of total reserves | | 100% | | | 100%
Standardized measure ($ in millions)⁽ᵃ⁾ | $ | 56.7 | | $ | 49.6


(a) | Standardized measure is the present value of estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves. It is determined using SEC-required prices and costs in effect as of the time of estimation without giving effect to non-property related expenses (such as general and administrative expenses or debt service costs) and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. Our standardized measure does not include the impact of derivative transactions or future federal income taxes because we are not subject to federal income taxes. Future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. The standardized measure shown should not be considered the current market value of our reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate present value, which is required, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate.

      Our 2017 estimates of total proved reserves decreased 1.6 MMBoe from 2016 primarily due to divestitures totaling approximately 1.7 MMBoe, partially offset by an increase of 0.8 MMBoe due to higher commodity prices.
 As of December 31, 2017, we have no remaining proved undeveloped reserves (“PUD”) in our reserves base.
 We expect to make minimum capital expenditures related to recompletion of existing wells during the year ending December 31, 2018. 
 At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, Ryder Scott Co. LP (“Ryder Scott”), an independent oil and natural gas engineering firm, prepared estimates of all our proved reserves. We used Ryder Scott’s estimates of our proved reserves to prepare our financial statements. Ryder Scott maintains a degreed staff of highly competent technical personnel. The average experience level of Ryder Scott’s technical staff of engineers, geoscientists and petro physicists exceeds 20 years, including five to 15 years with a major oil company. The engineering information presented in Ryder Scott’s report was overseen by Mr. Eric Nelson, P.E. Mr. Nelson is an experienced reservoir engineer having been a practicing petroleum engineer since 2002. He has more than 12 years of experience in reserves evaluation with Ryder Scott. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Tulsa and Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Texas. Mr. Nelson is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. Our activities with Ryder Scott are coordinated by a reservoir engineer employed by us who has approximately 37 years of experience in the oil and natural gas industry and an engineering degree from the University of Tennessee and a Master of Business Administration from the University of New Orleans. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. He has prior reservoir engineering and reserves management experience at Exxon Mobil Corporation, Dominion Resources and Hilcorp Energy. He has extensive experience in managing oil and natural gas reserves processes. He serves as the key technical person reviewing the reserve reports prepared by Ryder Scott prior to review by the audit committee of the board of directors of our general partner and approval by the board of directors of our general partner.

  Existing Wells 
 The following table sets forth information at December 31, 2017, relating to the existing wells in which we owned a working interest as of that date. Gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have an interest, and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells. 
 | Natural Gas | Oil
 | Gross | Net | Gross | Net
Operated | — | — | — | — 
Non-operated | 91 | 17 | 107 | 40 
Total | 91 | 17 | 107 | 40 

      We did not convert any proved undeveloped wells into proved producing wells in 2017. 
 Drilling Activity 
 With respect to oil and natural gas wells drilled and completed during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value. Productive wells are those that are capable of producing commercial quantities of oil or natural gas, regardless of whether they produce a reasonable rate of return. No exploratory wells were drilled on any of our properties during the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016.  During the year ended December 31, 2017, 1 gross well was drilled, or approximately 0.2

net wells.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, 1 gross well was recompleted, or approximately 0.7 net wells.  There were no wells in progress at December 31, 2017.
 Developed and Undeveloped Acreage 
 The following table sets forth information related to our leasehold acreage as of December 31, 2017. 
    
 | Developed | Undeveloped
 | Acreage(a) | Acreage(b) 
 | Gross(c) | Net(d) | Gross(c) | Net(d)
Total | 2,188 | 632 | — | — 


(a) | Developed acres are acres pooled within or assigned to productive wells/units.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | Undeveloped acres are acres on which wells have not been drilled or acres that have not been pooled into a productive unit.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | A gross acre is an acre in which a working interest is either fully or partially leased. The number of gross acres may include minerals not under lease as a result of leasing some but not all joint mineral owners under any given tract.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | A net acre is deemed to exist when the sum of the fractional ownership working interests in gross acres equals one. The number of net acres is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Leases
 Most of our reserves are wellbore rights only. We have a small lease position of less than 1,000 net acres in Louisiana.
 Marketing and Major Customers
 Our oil and natural gas production in the onshore Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana Gulf Coast region is marketed by the operators of our properties.
 Sanchez Energy, whose earned revenues contribute exclusively to our midstream segment, accounted for 63% and 76% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Additional information regarding our relationship with Sanchez Energy is provided in Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Manager Independence.” Markets and Competition
 We operate in a competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and retaining trained personnel.  Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and personnel resources than us. As a result, our competitors may be able to outbid us for assets, more competitively price their gathering and transportation services and oil and natural gas production, or utilize superior technical resources than our financial or personnel resources permit.  Our ability to acquire additional assets will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable assets and to consummate transactions in a competitive environment.
 The natural gas gathering, compression, treating and transportation business is very competitive.  Upon such time that we seek to obtain customers in addition to Sanchez Energy for Western Catarina Midstream, our competitors will include other midstream companies, producers and intrastate and interstate pipelines.  Competition for volumes is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, location, available capacity, capital expenditures and fuel efficiencies.
 Neither SOG nor any of its related companies are restricted from competing with us. Additional information regarding our relationship with SOG is provided in Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Manager Independence.”

 Governmental Regulation
 Environmental Laws
 Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the discharge of materials into the environment.  These laws and regulations may, among other things:
· | require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances, including water and waste, that can be released into the environment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | limit or prohibit activities on lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible in the absence of such regulations.  The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability.  In addition, federal, state and local authorities frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
 Environmental laws and regulations that could have a material impact on the oil and natural gas industry and our operations include the following:
 Waste Handling
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous wastes and non-hazardous wastes.  Under the auspices of the federal Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements.  Drilling fluids, produced waters and most other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions.  Although we do not believe that the current costs of managing any of our wastes are material under presently applicable laws, any future reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as hazardous wastes, could increase our costs to manage and dispose of wastes. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment.  These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, a hazardous substance released at the site.  Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies.  In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
 We currently own, lease or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas production for a number of years.  Although we believe that operating and waste disposal practices utilized in the past with respect to these properties were typical for the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal.  In addition, these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous

owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons was not under our control.  These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws.  Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination.
 Water Discharges
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”), and comparable state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of produced water and other oil and natural gas wastes, into waters of the United States.  The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency.  Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties, impose investigatory or remedial obligations and issue injunctions limiting or preventing our operations for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. Oil Pollution Act
 The Oil Pollution Act was enacted in 1990 to amend the Clean Water Act in large part due to the Exxon Valdez incident. Under the Oil Pollution Act, the EPA was directed to promulgate regulations which would create a comprehensive prevention, response, liability and compensation program to deal with oil discharged into United States navigable waters.  In particular, the regulations developed under the Oil Pollution Act strengthened the requirements that apply to Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plans.  The Oil Pollution Act imposes liability for removal costs and damages resulting from an incident in which oil is discharged into navigable waters and establishes liability for damages for injuries to, or loss of, natural resources. Air Emissions
 The Clean Air Act, and comparable state laws, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements.  In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources.  In October 2015, the EPA finalized rules that lower the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 parts per billion (“ppb”) to 70 ppb, and the EPA published a final rule in November 2017 stating that 85% of U.S. counties are designated as “attainment/unclassified” but has not issued any non-attainment designations for the remaining 15%. States can also impose air emissions limitations that are more stringent than the federal standards imposed by the EPA.  Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations.  Rules restricting air emissions may require a number of modifications to our operations, including the installation of new equipment.  Compliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our operating results.  However, we believe that our operations will not be materially adversely affected by any such requirements, and the requirements are not expected to be any more burdensome to us than to other similarly situated companies.  We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with federal and state air emission standards. Climate Change 
 While the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), the prospect for adoption of significant legislation at the federal level to reduce GHG emissions is perceived to be low at this time. Requirements intended to reduce greenhouse gases have been adopted at the federal, regional and state levels. For example, in June 2016, the EPA adopted Subpart OOOOa establishing standards for methane emissions from oil and gas production. However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay portions of the Subpart OOOOa standards, and until the rule is finalized, future implementation of the 2016 standard is uncertain.  Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations that limit emissions of GHGs could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that production operators produce, some of whom are our customers, which could thereby reduce demand for our midstream services. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical 

 
  14

 
effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, it is uncertain if they would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.
 Hydraulic Fracturing
 Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons.  The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.  The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions.  However, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing practices and has finalized a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities, finding that under certain circumstances, the “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources.  In 2014, the EPA issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 requesting comments related to disclosure for hydraulic fracturing chemicals.  Further, the Department of the Interior has released final regulations governing hydraulic fracturing on federal oil and natural gas leases which require lessees to file for approval of well stimulation work before commencement of operations and require well operators to disclose the trade names and purposes of additives used in the fracturing fluids.  The states in which we operate have also adopted disclosure requirements related to fracturing fluids.  Legislation has been introduced, but not adopted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process.  In addition, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances.  Currently, no states in which we utilize hydraulic fracturing have adopted these regulations.  At this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing hydraulic fracturing would impact our business. Endangered Species
 The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), and analogous state laws, restrict activities that may affect listed endangered or threatened species or their habitats.  If endangered species are located in areas where we operate, our operations or any work performed related to them could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required.  While some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in compliance with the ESA. Additional listings under the ESA and similar state laws could result in the imposition of restrictions on our operations and consequently have an adverse effect on our business. Gathering System Regulation
 Regulation of gathering facilities may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our services. Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated by agencies of the U.S. federal government, primarily the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). The FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates, terms and conditions of service, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
 The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated primarily under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), and by regulations and orders promulgated under the NGA by the FERC. In certain limited circumstances, intrastate transportation, gathering, and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by the U.S. Congress and by FERC regulations. 
 Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the FERC under the NGA. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to establish whether a pipeline is a gathering pipeline not subject to FERC jurisdiction. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services has been the subject of substantial litigation and varying interpretations.  In addition, the FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our natural gas gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts, or the U.S. Congress. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual gathering facility is not exempt from FERC regulation and the pipeline provides interstate transportation, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the FERC. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise 

 
  15

 
operated in violation of the NGA or the NGPA, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the cost-based rate established by the FERC. 
 Gathering service, which may occur upstream of transmission service subject to FERC jurisdiction, is regulated by the states. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. Our purchasing and gathering operations are subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the State of Texas.  The ratable take statute generally requires gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling.  Similarly, the common purchaser statute generally requires gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer.  These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply.  These statutes have the effect of restricting our right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to purchase or transport gas.
 The Railroad Commission of Texas (“TRRC”) requires gatherers to file reports, obtain permits, make books and records available for audit and provide service on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Shippers and producers may file complaints with the TRRC to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering access and rate discrimination.
 While our systems have not been regulated by the FERC under the NGA, the U.S. Congress may enact legislation or the FERC may adopt regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to further regulation. Changes in law and to FERC policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action FERC will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas gatherers with which we compete. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability.
 The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”), amended the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by the FERC, and furthermore provides the FERC with additional civil penalty authority. The EPAct 2005 provided the FERC with the power to assess civil penalties per day for violations of the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act (“NGPA”). The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. In Order No. 670, the FERC promulgated rules implementing the anti-market manipulation provision of the EPAct 2005. The rules make it unlawful, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to: (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The anti-market manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. 
 Pipeline Safety Regulation
 We are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”) under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (“HLPSA”) and comparable state statutes with respect to design, installation, inspection, testing, construction, operation, replacement and maintenance of pipeline facilities. HLPSA covers petroleum and petroleum products, including NGLs and condensate, and requires any entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such regulations, to permit access to and copying of records and to file certain reports and provide information as required by the U.S. Secretary of Transportation. These regulations include potential fines and penalties for violations. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these HLPSA regulations.
 Our natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (“NGPSA”) and the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (“PSIA”), as reauthorized and amended by the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 (“PIPES Act”). The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance 

 
  16

 
of gas pipeline facilities, while the PSIA establishes mandatory inspections for all U.S. oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in high-consequence areas (“HCAs”). 
 PHMSA has developed regulations that require pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs. The regulations require operators, including us, to: 

· | perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a HCA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | improve data collection, integration and analysis;
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | implement preventive and mitigating actions.
--+---------------------------------------------

  The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (“2011 Pipeline Safety Act”) reauthorizes funding for federal pipeline safety programs, increases penalties for safety violations, establishes additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines, and requires studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, among other things, increases the maximum civil penalty for pipeline safety violations and directs the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to promulgate rules or standards relating to expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, excess flow valve use, leak detection system installation and testing to confirm the material strength of pipe operating above 30% of specified minimum yield strength in HCAs.
 PHMSA regularly revises its pipeline safety regulations and has published advanced notices of proposed rulemakings and notices of proposed rulemaking to solicit comments on the need for changes to its natural gas and liquid pipeline safety regulations. In the past few years, PHMSA issued advisory bulletins providing guidance on applicable regulatory requirements, including those that must be followed for the abandonment of a pipeline; aspects of overall pipeline integrity, including the need for corrosion-control systems on buried and insulated pipeline segments, to conduct in-line inspections for all threats, and to ensure in-line inspection tool findings are accurate and verified; the need of owners and operators of natural gas facilities to take appropriate steps to prevent damage to pipeline facilities from accumulated snow or ice; actions pipeline operators should consider taking to ensure the integrity of pipelines in the event of severe flooding or hurricane damage; notice of construction; flow reversal procedures; product changes and conversion; integrity management program evaluation metrics; and incident response plans. Further changes to PHMSA’s rules are expected in the future. 
 For example, in July 2015, PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing, among other things, to extend operator qualification requirements to operators of certain natural gas gathering lines and to add a specific timeframe for operators’ notifications of accidents or incidents.  In January 2017, PHMSA issued a final rule adding a specific timeframe for operators’ notifications of accidents or incidents but delayed final action on the operator qualification proposals until a later date.  The final rule became effective March 24, 2017.  In addition, in October 2015, PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing changes to its hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations, including to extend: (i) reporting requirements to all onshore or offshore, regulated or unregulated hazardous liquid gathering lines; and (ii) certain integrity management periodic assessment and remediation requirements to regulated onshore gathering lines.  On January 13, 2017, PHMSA issued a final rule amending its regulations to impose new reporting requirements for certain unregulated pipelines, including all hazardous liquid gathering lines. The final rule also significantly extends and expands the reach of certain integrity management requirements, regardless of the pipeline’s proximity to a HCA. However, this final rule remains subject to review and approval by the new administration, pursuant to a memorandum issued by the White House to heads of federal agencies. It is unclear whether the final rule will be revised and when it will be implemented. In April 2016, PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would expand integrity management requirements and impose new pressure requirements on currently regulated gas transmission pipelines and would also significantly expand the regulation of gas gathering lines, subjecting previously unregulated pipelines to requirements regarding damage prevention, corrosion control, public education programs, maximum allowable operating pressure limits 

 
  17

 
and other requirements. PHMSA has not yet finalized these proposed regulations.  While we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, such regulatory changes and any legislative changes could have a material effect on our operations, particularly by extending more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations (such as integrity management requirements) to pipelines and gathering lines not previously subject to such requirements. While we expect any legislative or regulatory changes to allow us time to become compliant with new requirements, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations.
 Furthermore, DOT regulations have incorporated by reference the American Petroleum Institute Standard 653 (“API 653”) as the industry standard for the inspection, repair, alteration and reconstruction of storage tanks.  API 653 requires regularly scheduled inspection and repair of such tanks.  These periodic tank maintenance requirements may result in significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our storage tanks.
 States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines but most are certified by the DOT to assume responsibility for enforcing intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. For example, in Texas the Pipeline Safety Department of the TRRC inspects and enforces the pipeline safety regulations for intrastate pipelines, including gathering lines. States may adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines; however, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. State standards may include more stringent requirements for facility design and management in addition to requirements for pipelines. We do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations. Our pipelines have ongoing inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements. 
 We have incorporated all existing requirements into our programs by the required regulatory deadlines and are continually incorporating the new requirements into procedures and budgets. We expect to incur increasing regulatory compliance costs, based on the intensification of the regulatory environment and upcoming changes to regulations as outlined above. In addition to regulatory changes, costs may be incurred when there is an accidental release of a commodity gathered on our system, or a regulatory inspection identifies a deficiency in our required programs.
 Other Laws and Regulation
 We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state laws. These laws and the implementing regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees.  The OSHA hazard communications standard, OSHA Process Safety Management, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state laws require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations.  We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements.
 We believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our current operations and that our continued compliance with existing requirements should not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2017, we had no accrued environmental obligations. We are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures or that will otherwise have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  However, we cannot predict how future environmental laws and regulations may impact our operations, and therefore, cannot provide assurance that the passage of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
