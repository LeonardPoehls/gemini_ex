Item 1. Business.
General
The Company is a leading national specialty retailer of apparel for women and tween girls. The Company operates, through its 100% owned subsidiaries, ecommerce operations and approximately 4,800 stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. The Company had annual revenue for Fiscal 2017 of approximately $6.6 billion. 
Change for Growth Program
In the first quarter of Fiscal 2017, the Company initiated a transformation plan with the objective of supporting sustainable long-term growth and increasing shareholder value (the "Change for Growth" program). In connection with the program, the Company (i) refined its operating model by eliminating a number of executive positions and making organizational changes resulting in the creation of the Premium Fashion, Value Fashion, Plus Fashion and Kids Fashion operating segments, (ii) further consolidated certain support functions into its brand services group, including Human Resources, Real Estate, Non-Merchandise Procurement, and Asset Protection, (iii) began transitioning certain transaction processing functions within the brand services group to an independent third-party managed-service provider, and (iv) conducted a review of its store fleet with the goal of reducing the number of marginally profitable stores through either rent reductions or store closures, in an effort to increase the overall profitability of the remaining store footprint and convert sales from these stores into ecommerce sales or to nearby store locations ("Fleet Optimization"). The Company realized savings of approximately $65 million during Fiscal 2017 and we expect to realize an 
3

additional $185-$235 million in cost savings through fiscal 2020. Activities associated with the Change for Growth program are currently expected to continue through fiscal 2019.
Integration of ANN
On August 21, 2015, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of ANN INC. ("ANN"), a retailer of women’s apparel, shoes and accessories sold primarily under the Ann Taylor and LOFT brands, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion (the "ANN Acquisition"), as more fully described in Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The acquisition is intended to diversify our portfolio of brands that serve the needs of women of different ages, sizes and demographics. 
During Fiscal 2017, integration activities continued as the Company (i) completed the integration of ANN’s ecommerce operations into its Greencastle fulfillment center, (ii) negotiated favorable contracts with vendors and (iii) realized cost reductions from sourcing merchandise through third-party buying agents. As a result of these initiatives, the Company has realized cumulative integration-related cost savings of approximately $160 million through Fiscal 2017. We expect to realize additional synergies of approximately $75 million related to the integration of ANN in Fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. 
Our Brands and Products 

In connection with the Change for Growth program described above, effective the first quarter of Fiscal 2017, the Company reorganized into four operating segments: Premium Fashion, Value Fashion, Plus Fashion and Kids Fashion. 
Premium Fashion
The Premium Fashion segment consists of the Ann Taylor and LOFT brands.

Its retail stores are predominantly located in mall locations, lifestyle centers and outlet centers.

Through its proprietary label, the maurices product line encompasses women’s casual clothing, career wear, dressy apparel, active wear and accessories. maurices retail stores are typically located near large discount and department stores to capitalize on the traffic those retailers generate, while differentiating itself by offering a wider selection of style, color and current fashion, along with an elevated customer shopping experience.

The Company continues to invest in initiatives that support our omni-channel strategies.

Additionally, the Company's new distribution center in Riverside, California commenced west coast brick-and-mortar distribution this past spring. The Company's distribution centers in Etna, Ohio and Riverside, California, and its fulfillment center in Greencastle, Indiana, are expected to enhance its fulfillment capability and distribution efficiency.

That review identified 667 stores for action, of which 120 were closed in Fiscal 2017. Store actions under the Change for Growth program are expected to continue through fiscal 2019.
Trademarks

We have U.S. Trademark Registration Certificates and trademark applications pending for the operating names of our stores and our major private label merchandise brands. We believe our trademarks such as ANN TAYLOR®, LOFT®, ANN TAYLOR LOFT®, LOU & GREY®, JUSTICE®, LANE BRYANT®, LANE BRYANT OUTLET®, CACIQUE®, RIGHT FIT®, MAURICES®, DRESSBARN®, CATHERINES®, CATHERINES PLUS SIZES® and DRESSBAR® and 6th & LANE® are essential to the continued success of our business. We intend to maintain our trademarks and related registrations and vigorously protect them against infringement. 
International Operations

As of July 29, 2017, Ann Taylor, LOFT, Justice and maurices had 4, 9, 39 and 37 company-operated stores in Canada, respectively. Additionally, we earn licensing revenue through international franchise stores operated under franchise arrangements. Licensing revenue is less than 1% of our consolidated annual net sales. As of July 29, 2017, LOFT and Justice had 5 and 87 international franchise stores, respectively. We continue to explore international opportunities for our brands. International revenue from company-owned stores and franchised stores accounts for approximately 2% of our consolidated annual net sales.
Sourcing

The Company's brands source their products either through its internal sourcing operations, Ascena Global Sourcing (“AGS”), or through third-party buying agents. Factors affecting the selection of sourcing channels include cost, speed-to-market, merchandise selection, vendor capacity and fashion trends.
Operating through offices primarily located in Seoul, South Korea, Shanghai, China and Hong Kong, AGS maintains direct relationships with manufacturing partners, enabling desired product quality control and speed to market, along with favorable pricing as compared to market vendors. 
The Company also sources some of its merchandise through third-party buying agents based mainly in Asia. The Company partners with these agents to inform product development by leveraging insight into fashion trends and customer preferences. In certain instances (e.g. sourcing in developing countries, or for specific product attribute or unique capability), this buying-agent sourcing network provides favorable cost, quality and/or flexibility for the Company's merchandising teams.
Merchandising and Design
We continue to focus on building our merchandising and design functions to align with our market positions and support our direct sourcing model. Our merchandising and design teams determine inventory needs for the upcoming season in response to fast changing fashion trends and customer preferences. Over the last few years, we have made substantial investment in acquiring and retaining merchandising and design talent to allow us to differentiate our fashion offering, which we believe is a critical enabler for our long-term success. 
Office and Distribution Centers

Information Technology Systems

We continue to make ongoing investments in our information technology systems to support our omni-channel strategy, merchandise procurement, inventory management and supply chain integration. Our information technology systems make the design, marketing, importing and distribution of our products more efficient by providing common platforms for, among other things, order processing, product and design information, and financial information. 
Advertising and Marketing
We use a combination of broad-based and targeted marketing and advertising strategies to effectively define, evolve, and promote our brands. These strategies are designed to deliver a personalized and relevant shopping experience for our customers and include customer research, advertising and promotional events, window and in-store marketing materials, direct mail marketing, Internet and social media marketing, lifestyle magazines, catazines and other means of communication.
Customer Relationship Management 
We continue to focus on building our customer relationships and promoting customer loyalty through various programs including brand-specific loyalty and credit card programs. Customers shopping at our brands who are enrolled in our loyalty programs earn reward points that are redeemable toward future purchases. Our brands also offer credit card programs to eligible customers in the United States. To encourage customers to apply for a credit card, we provide a discount to approved card members on all purchases made with a new card on the day of application acceptance. Rewards points are then earned on purchases made with the credit card at that brand. In addition, under the co-branded credit card program, certain of our brands offer the customer the option of earning additional reward points for purchases made at any other business in which the card is accepted.
These programs provide useful information that allows us to enhance our existing customer relationship management capabilities. Using data analytic tools, we obtain more insightful information about our customer preferences and shopping behaviors, allowing us to deliver a more targeted and personalized shopping experience. 
Community Service 
ascena and its brands have a rich history of giving. This is demonstrated through ascena cares, which reflects our culture and the extraordinary philanthropic efforts taking place within our organization. Together, we have a shared commitment for making the world a better place for the women and girls we serve, for the communities where we live and work and for our dedicated associates. The Company is also proud to sponsor the Roslyn S. Jaffe Awards, in which monetary grants are awarded to female social entrepreneurs who are making a meaningful difference for women and children. Whether through collective partnerships or individual brand outreach efforts, ascena supports the women who buy, make and sell our products. More information about the history of our charitable giving, including the charities we support, is available at www.ascenacares.com. 
Competition
The retail apparel industry is highly competitive and increasingly fragmented. We compete with numerous retailers, including department stores, off-price retailers, specialty stores and Internet-based retailers, on pricing, styles and fulfillment capability. Our business is vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts, channel shifts and changes in customer preferences. Some of our competitors operate at a lower cost structure, and are able to offer better pricing; others have more sophisticated ecommerce or omni-channel capacities. Some of our competitors include Gap Inc., Amazon, Walmart, Macy’s, JCPenney, Target and TJX Companies. Other competitors may enter the markets that we serve. If we fail to compete successfully, we could face continued sales declines and may need to offer greater discounts to our customers, which could result in decreased profitability. We are aggressively working to differentiate our brands and our assortments to reinforce the value proposition we deliver by focusing on our target customers and by offering up-to-date fashion, superior customer service and shopping convenience across our multiple sales channels. 
Merchandise Vendors

We purchase our merchandise from many domestic and foreign suppliers. We have no long-term purchase commitments or arrangements with any of our suppliers, and believe that we are not dependent on any one supplier as no third-party supplier accounts for more than 10% of our merchandise purchases. We believe that we have good working relationships with our suppliers.

8

Employees

As of July 29, 2017, we had approximately 64,000 employees, 48,000 of whom worked on a part-time basis. We typically add temporary employees during peak selling periods, which vary throughout the year at each of our brands, and adjust the hours they work to coincide with holiday shopping patterns. None of our other employees are covered by any collective bargaining agreement at the end of Fiscal 2017 except for approximately 60 employees of Lane Bryant that were represented by unions. We believe that we have good working relations with our employees and unions.
