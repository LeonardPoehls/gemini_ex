Item 1. | BUSINESS

General
Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc. (the "Company," "Hill-Rom," "we," "us," or "our") was incorporated on August 7, 1969 in the State of Indiana and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. We are a leading global medical technology company with more than 10,000 employees worldwide. We partner with health care providers in more than 100 countries by focusing on patient care solutions that improve clinical and economic outcomes. Hill-Rom's people, products and programs work towards one mission: Every day, around the world, we enhance outcomes for patients and their caregivers. 
Segment Information
During our first quarter of fiscal 2017, we changed our segment reporting to reflect changes in our organizational structure and management’s operation and view of the business. We combined the prior year North America Patient Support Systems segment and International Patient Support Systems segment into a new segment called Patient Support Systems. Our revised operating structure is generally aligned by product type and contains the following reporting segments:

• | Patient Support Systems – globally provides our specialty bed frames and surfaces and mobility solutions, as well as our clinical workflow solutions which specializes in software and information technologies to improve care and deliver actionable insight to caregivers and patients.


• | Front Line Care – globally provides respiratory care products, and sells medical diagnostic monitoring equipment and a diversified portfolio of physical assessment tools that assess, diagnose, treat, and manage a wide variety of illnesses and diseases.


• | Surgical Solutions – globally provides products that improve surgical safety and efficiency in the operating room including tables, lights, pendants, positioning devices and various other surgical products and accessories.

Net revenue, segment profitability and other measures of segment reporting for each reporting segment are set forth in Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Products and Services
Patient Support Systems. Our innovative patient support systems include a variety of specialty frames and surfaces, such as Medical Surgical ("Med-Surg") beds, Intensive Care Unit ("ICU") beds, and Bariatric patient beds, patient mobility solutions (such as lifts and other devices used to safely move patients), non-invasive therapeutic products and surfaces, and our communications technologies and software solutions. These patient support systems are sold globally and can be designed for use in high, mid, and low acuity settings, depending on the specific design options, and are built to advance mobility, reduce patient falls and caregiver injuries, improve caregiver efficiency and prevent and care for pressure injuries. In addition, we also sell equipment service contracts for our capital equipment, primarily in the U.S. Approximately 52%, 55% and 72% of our revenue during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, was derived from this segment.
Front Line Care. Our Front Line Care products include our patient monitoring and diagnostics products from Welch Allyn, Inc. ("Welch Allyn") and Mortara Instruments, Inc. ("Mortara") and our respiratory health products. Our patient monitoring and diagnostics products include blood pressure, physical assessment, vital signs monitoring, diagnostic cardiopulmonary, diabetic

retinopathy screening, and thermometry products. We also see exciting opportunities to integrate Welch Allyn and Mortara technologies and patient data in the care environment to further enhance our product offerings. Our respiratory health products include the Vest® System, VitalCough® System, MetaNeb® System and new MonarchTM System. These products are designed to assist patients in the mobilization of retained blockages that, if not removed, may lead to increased rates of respiratory infection, hospitalization, and reduced lung function. Front Line Care products are sold globally within multiple care settings including primary care (Welch Allyn and Mortara products), acute care, extended care and home care (primarily respiratory health products). Approximately 32%, 30% and 7% of our revenue during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were derived from products within this segment.
Surgical Solutions. Our Surgical Solutions products include surgical tables, lights, and pendants utilized within the operating room setting. We also offer a range of positioning devices for use in shoulder, hip, spinal and lithotomy surgeries as well as platform-neutral positioning accessories for nearly every model of operating room table. In addition, we offer operating room surgical safety and accessory products such as scalpels and blades, light handle systems, skin markers and other disposable products. The products offered within this category are both capital sales and recurring consumable revenue streams that are sold globally. Approximately 16%, 15% and 21% of our revenue during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were derived from products within this segment.
We have extensive distribution capabilities and broad reach across all health care settings. We primarily operate in the following channels: (1) sales and rentals of products to acute and extended care facilities worldwide through both a direct sales force and distributors; (2) sales and rentals of products directly to patients in the home; and (3) sales into primary care facilities (primarily Welch Allyn products) through distributors. Through our network of approximately 140 North American and 42 international service centers, and approximately 1,900 service professionals, we provide technical support and services and rapidly deliver our products to customers on an as-needed basis, providing our customers flexibility to purchase or rent select products. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of our revenue.
Raw Materials
Principal materials used in our products for each business segment include carbon steel, aluminum, stainless steel, wood and laminates, petroleum based products, such as foams and plastics, and other materials, substantially all of which are available from multiple sources. Motors and electronic controls for electrically operated beds and certain other components are purchased from one or more manufacturers.
Prices fluctuate for raw materials and sub-assemblies used in our products based on a number of factors beyond our control. Specifically, over the past several years, the fluctuating prices of certain raw materials, including metals, fuel, plastics and other petroleum-based products in particular, and fuel related delivery costs, had a direct effect on our profitability. Although we generally have not engaged in hedging transactions with respect to raw material purchases, we have entered into fixed price supply contracts at times.
Most of our extended contracts with hospital Group Purchasing Organizations ("GPOs") and other customers for the sale of products in North America permit us to institute annual list price increases, although we may not be able to raise prices sufficiently to offset all raw material cost inflation.
Competition
Across our business, we compete on the basis of clinical expertise and resulting product clinical utility and ability to produce favorable outcomes, as well as value, quality, customer service, innovation and breadth of product offerings. We evaluate our competition based on our product categories.

Additionally, we compete with a large number of smaller and regional manufacturers.
Regulatory Matters
FDA Regulation. We design, manufacture, install and distribute medical devices that are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in the U.S. and similar agencies in other countries. The regulations and standards of these agencies evolve over time and require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes and quality systems to remain in compliance. The FDA’s Quality System regulations and the regulatory equivalents internationally set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities. From time to time, the FDA performs routine inspections of our facilities and may inform us of certain deficiencies in our processes or facilities. In addition, there are certain state and local government requirements that must be complied with in the manufacturing and marketing of our products. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.
Environmental. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to environmental and health and safety concerns, including the handling, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials used in, or derived from, our manufacturing processes. When necessary, we provide for reserves in our financial statements for environmental matters. We do not expect the remediation costs for any environmental issues in which we are currently involved to exceed $1.0 million.
Health Care Regulations. In March 2010, comprehensive health care reform legislation was signed into law through the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. The health care industry continues to undergo significant change as this law is executed. Currently, the Trump Administration and the U.S. Congress are seeking to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all or part of this health care reform legislation and it remains unclear what new framework may emerge as a result of such efforts. In addition to health care reform, Medicare, Medicaid and managed care organizations, such as health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations, traditional indemnity insurers and third-party administrators are under increasing pressure to control costs and limit utilization, while improving quality and health care outcomes. These objectives are being advanced through a variety of reform initiatives including: accountable care organizations, value based purchasing, bundling initiatives, competitive bidding programs, etc. We are also subject to a number of other regulations around the world related to the sale and distribution of health care products. The potential impact of these regulations to our business is discussed further in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in this Form 10-K.

Product Development
Most of our products and product improvements are developed internally. We maintain close working relationships with various medical professionals who assist in product research and development. New and improved products play a critical role in our sales growth. We continue to place emphasis on the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines. Our significant research and development activities are located in Acton, Massachusetts; Batesville, Indiana; Beaverton, Oregon; Bologna, Italy; Cary, North Carolina; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Skaneateles Falls, New York; Pluvigner, France; Singapore; and Saalfeld and Pucheim, Germany.
Research and development is expensed as incurred. Research and development expense for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, was $133.7 million, $133.5 million and $91.8 million, respectively.
In addition, certain software development technology costs for software to be sold or licensed to customers are capitalized as intangibles and are amortized over a period of three to five years once the software is ready for its intended use. The amounts capitalized during fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $2.3 million, $2.4 million and $2.6 million, respectively.
Patents and Trademarks
We own, and from time-to-time license, a number of patents on our products and manufacturing processes, but we do not believe any single patent or related group of patents is of material significance to any business segment or our business as a whole. We also own a number of trademarks and service marks relating to our products and services. Except for the marks "Hill-Rom®", "Bard-Parker®", and "Welch Allyn®", we do not believe any single trademark or service mark is of material significance to any business segment or our business as a whole.
Foreign Operations
Information about our foreign operations is set forth in tables relating to geographic information in Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

We are also subject to various collective bargaining arrangements or national agreements outside the U.S. covering approximately 16% of our employees. The collective bargaining agreement at our primary U.S. manufacturing facility expires in January 2019. We have not experienced a work stoppage in the U.S. in over 40 years, and we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-K for additional information about our employees.
