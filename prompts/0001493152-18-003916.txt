ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
RealBiz Media Group, Inc., including all its subsidiaries, are collectively referred to herein as “RealBiz,” “RBIZ”, “the Company,” “us,” or “we”.
 
Overview

We were previously engaged in the business of providing digital media and marketing services for the real estate industry and generated revenue from service fees (video creation and production and website hosting (ReachFactor)) and product sales (Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 and Microvideo app). Previously, we were formed through the merging of three divisions: (i) our fully licensed real estate division (formerly known as Webdigs); (ii) our TV media contracts (Home Preview Channel /Extraordinary Vacation Homes) division; and (iii) our Real Estate Virtual Tour and Media group (RealBiz 360). The assets of these three divisions was used to create a new suite of real estate products and services that created stickiness through the utilization of video, social media and loyalty programs.
 
On October 27, 2017, we entered into a Contribution and Spin-off Agreement (the “Spin-Off Agreement”) with NestBuilder.com Corp., a Nevada corporation and newly formed digital real estate company (“NestBuilder”) pursuant to which we will spin-off our real estate division into NestBuilder. All stockholders of record at the time of the spin-off will receive an equivalent stock position in NestBuilder (the “Distribution”). The obligation of the Company and NestBuilder to consummate the Distribution was subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) declaring NestBuilder’s Registration Statement on Form 10 effective, which Form 10 was declared effective by the SEC on February 20, 2018. Following the effective date of the Registration Statement on Form 10, the parties deemed it advisable and in the best interest of such parties to fix February 23, 2018 as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the Distribution. The Distribution is currently scheduled to occur four weeks after the effective date of the Registration Statement on Form 10.
 
As of the date hereof, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Verus Foods, Inc. (“Verus”) focus on international consumer packaged goods, foodstuff distribution and wholesale trade. Verus was incorporated in Nevada in January 2017 and is an international supplier of consumer food products. Verus markets products under its own brand primarily to supermarkets, hotels and other members of the wholesale trade. In 2018, Verus is pursuing a three-pronged development program through the addition of cold-storage facilities, product line expansion and new vertical farm-to-market operations. Verus’ initial focus in 2017 was on frozen foods, particularly meat, poultry, seafood, vegetables and french fries. Subsequently, in 2017, Verus added beverages as a second vertical. Verus has a significant regional presence in the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”) and sub-Saharan Africa (excluding Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) restricted nations), with deep roots in the Gulf Cooperation Council (“GCC”) countries, which includes the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.


In January 2017, Verus received a contract valued at $78 million to supply beef to the GCC countries. In addition, Verus executed an agreement in August 2017 to become an exclusive distributor of Disney-branded juice products in the UAE and Oman. The first purchase order under the agreement was issued in December 2017.
 
Seasonality of Business
 
Verus is expected to have only modest seasonality due to the product mix, which will include many staples such as nuts, fruits, honey and meats. We expect our initial growth rates to mask any seasonality during our first years of operation. In the Middle East markets, we expect to see a spike in sales during the month of Ramadan.
Government Regulation
 
Verus is subject to U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and other government regulations in the countries in which we operate.
 
In addition, doing business outside the United States requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions, which place restrictions on our operations, trade practices, partners and investment decisions. In particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) or the Bribery Act and export controls. The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. In addition, the Bribery Act extends beyond bribery of foreign public officials and also applies to transactions with private persons. The provisions of the Bribery Act are also more onerous than the FCPA in a number of other respects, including jurisdictional reach, non-exemption of facilitation payments and, potentially, penalties.
Competition
 
Currently, Verus generates a majority of its revenue from food imports into the GCC countries of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. According to a report published in February 2017 by Alpen Capital, food imports into the GCC are expected to reach $53.1 billion by 2020. According to Global Islamic Economy Gateway,  imports account for about 78% of food consumed in the GCC.
 
The GCC has highly developed wholesale, grocery, and retail infrastructures that attract thousands of brands from around the world. According to A.T. Kearney, at the wholesale level, the region may be served by as many as 600 food distributors, some of which also conduct business in other parts of the Middle East and North Africa.  In the branded product space, key competitors include The Savola Group and Almarai which are based in Saudi Arabia; Americana Quality which is based in Kuwait; and Al Islami Foods which is based in the UAE, which currently ranks as the world’s largest Halal food vendor, with more than 100 frozen and specialty lines. Verus also competes with recognized international brands from multi-line companies such as Nestle and Mondelez International.
 
Verus believes that there are many food categories and niches in which it can successfully compete in this highly-fragmented market. Verus offers both Verus-branded products along with other brands, particularly from brands wanting to enter the GCC, but lacking the infrastructure or expertise to do so. In the latter category of brands wanting to enter the GCC, the number of companies seeking to sell their products through a partner such as Verus is significant.
 
In addition to the foregoing, management believes that Verus is one of the only U.S. based public companies operating in the region that can provide its own branded products and also act as a distributor for other brands across all of the major food sales categories. Management believes that a majority of the suppliers in this space are either non-U.S. based, private companies or are public entities with a narrow focus on their own brands. U.S. companies that supply food are the most highly respected in the GCC, due to their adherence to strict USDA standards, government oversight and reliability. As a result, U.S. affiliation and/or labeling are trusted in the GCC marketplace and American branding is highly desirable among consumers.

We were incorporated in the state of Delaware under the name Webdigs, Inc on July 12, 2012. On October 9, 2012, we consummated a share exchange (the “Exchange Transaction”) with Monaker Group, Inc. (formerly known as Next 1 Interactive, Inc.), a Nevada corporation (“Monaker”) pursuant to which we received all of the outstanding equity in Attaché Travel International, Inc., a Florida corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Monaker (“Attaché”) in consideration for the issuance of 93 million shares of our newly designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to Monaker. Attaché owned approximately 80% of a corporation named RealBiz Holdings Inc. which is the parent corporation of RealBiz 360, Inc. (“RealBiz”). As a condition to the closing of the Exchange Transaction, on October 3, 2012, we changed our name from “Webdigs, Inc.” to “RealBiz Media Group, Inc.”, by consummating a short-form parent-subsidiary merger in the State of Delaware.


In August 2015, we completed the restructuring of our management, financial reporting and operations from our former parent company, Monaker. The primary purpose of the restructuring was to eliminate unnecessary development expenses and unlock revenue opportunities by creating a unified technology platform.
 
On August 6, 2015, we issued an aggregate 35,000 shares of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock to (i) Keith White, a member of the Company’s Board of Director at the time and (ii) a company controlled by the Company’s then Chairman, Don Monaco. Mr. Monaco received 20,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock in consideration for the cancellation of $100,000 in indebtedness owed to him by the Company’s former parent company, Monaker. The debt was convertible into 2 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Mr. White received 15,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock in exchange for 15,000 shares the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock held by Mr. White.
 
On October 27, 2017, we entered into the Spin-Off Agreement with NestBuilder pursuant to which we will spin-off our real estate division into NestBuilder.
