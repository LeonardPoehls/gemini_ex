Item 1. Business
Legal Organization
AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was acquired by its principal stockholders in 1998 and began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on November 13, 2006. References to “AmTrust,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other statements and information publicly disseminated by AmTrust Financial Services, Inc., refer to the consolidated operations of the holding company.
Business Overview
AmTrust underwrites and provides property and casualty insurance products, including workers' compensation, commercial automobile, general liability and extended service and warranty coverage, in the United States and internationally to niche customer groups that we believe are generally underserved within the broader insurance market.
Our business model focuses on achieving superior returns and profit growth with the careful management of risk. We pursue these goals through geographic and product diversification, as well as an in-depth understanding of our insured exposures. Our product mix includes, primarily, workers’ compensation, extended warranty and other commercial property/casualty insurance products. Our workers’ compensation and property/casualty insurance policyholders in the United States are generally small and middle market businesses. Our extended warranty customers are manufacturers, distributors and retailers of commercial and consumer products. We have also built a strong and growing distribution of extended warranty and specialty risk products, including liability and other property/casualty products, in Europe. The majority of our products are sold through independent third-party brokers, agents, retailers or administrators. Our strategy is to target small to middle size customer markets throughout the U.S. and Europe where our proprietary technology platform enables us to efficiently manage the high volume of policies and claims that result from serving large numbers of small policyholders and warranty contract holders. The technology we have developed offers a level of service that is a competitive advantage in these high volume, lower risk markets by enhancing our ability to service, underwrite and adjudicate claims. Additionally, our ability to maintain and analyze high volumes of loss data over a long historical period allows us to better manage and forecast the underlying risk inherent in the portfolio. Since our inception in 1998, we have

TABLE OF CONTENTS

grown both organically and through an opportunistic acquisition strategy. We believe we approach acquisitions conservatively, and our strategy is to take relatively modest integration and balance sheet risk. Our acquisition activity has involved the purchase of companies, renewal rights to established books of insurance portfolios, access to distribution networks and the hiring of established teams of underwriters with expertise in our specialty lines.
We are committed to driving long-term stockholder value and industry-leading returns on equity by continuing to execute on our lower risk, lower volatility business model and leveraging technology to help maintain a more efficient cost structure, consistently generate solid underwriting profits and ensure strong customer service and retention rates. Additionally, we are focused on further enhancing our economies of scale by opportunistically expanding our geographic reach and product set, growing our network of agents and other distributors, developing new client relationships and executing our acquisition strategy. We are also focused on maintaining our disciplined approach to capital management while maximizing an appropriate risk-adjusted return on our growing investment portfolio. We continue to carefully monitor and maintain appropriate levels of reserves and seek to minimize our reinsurance recoverable exposure in order to maintain a strong balance sheet. We intend to expand our business and capital base to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities while maintaining or improving our A.M. Best ratings. Our principal insurance subsidiaries are rated “A” (Excellent) by A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), which is the third highest of 16 rating levels. 
Competition
The insurance industry, in general, is highly competitive and there is significant competition in the commercial business insurance sector. Competition in the insurance business is based on many factors, including coverage availability, claims management, safety services, payment terms, premium rates, policy terms, types of insurance offered, overall financial strength, financial ratings assigned by independent rating organizations, such as A.M. Best, and reputation. Some of the insurers with which we compete have greater financial, marketing and management resources than we do. We also compete with new market entrants. Our competitors include other insurance companies, state insurance pools and self-insurance funds. We generally target niche sectors and clients where the market is not as competitive as the broader market and where we have particular expertise and provide differentiated offerings compared to our competitors.
More than one hundred insurance companies participate in the workers’ compensation market. The insurance companies with which we compete vary by state and by the industries we target. We believe our competitive advantages include our efficient underwriting and claims management practices and systems and our A.M. Best rating of “A” (Excellent). In addition, we believe our lower processing costs allow us to competitively price our insurance products.
We believe the niche markets in the Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty sector in which we do business are less competitive than most other insurance sectors (including workers’ compensation insurance). We believe our Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty teams are recognized for their knowledge and expertise in the targeted markets. Nonetheless, we face significant competition, including several internationally well-known insurers that have greater financial, marketing and management resources and experience than we have. We believe that our competitive advantages include our ownership of both a U.S. warranty provider and a U.K. warranty provider, which enables us to directly administer the business, the ability to provide technical assistance to non-affiliate warranty providers, experienced underwriting, resourceful claims management practices and good relations with warranty administrators in the European Union, Asia and the United States.
Our Specialty Program segment employs a niche strategy of targeting smaller businesses, which helps to differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors. Most of our competing carriers pursue larger risks. We do not compete for high exposure business and underwrite lower hazard classes of business where service and execution are the basis for attracting and retaining business as opposed to providing the lowest price. Our competitive A.M. Best rating and financial size allow us to compete favorably for target business.
Underwriting and Claims Management Philosophy
We believe that proactive and prompt claims management is essential to reducing losses and lowering loss adjustment expenses and enables us to more effectively and accurately measure reserves. To this end, we utilize our proprietary technology and extensive database of loss history in order to appropriately price and structure policies, maintain lower levels of loss, enhance our ability to accurately predict losses, and maintain lower claims costs than the industry as a whole. We believe a strong underwriting foundation is best accomplished through careful risk selection and continuous evaluation of underwriting guidelines relative to loss experience. We are committed to a consistent and thorough review of each new underwriting opportunity and our portfolio as a whole, and, where permissible and appropriate, we customize the terms, conditions and exclusions of our coverage in order to manage risk and enhance profitability.

The following table provides our gross written premium by segment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:

(Amounts in Thousands) | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014

Additional financial information regarding our segments is presented in Note 28. “Segments” to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Small Commercial Business
This segment provides workers’ compensation insurance to small businesses that operate in low and medium hazard classes and commercial package and other property and casualty insurance products to small businesses, with average annual premiums of approximately $9,000. We are authorized to write our Small Commercial Business products in all 50 states. We distribute our policies through a network of over 9,500 select retail and wholesale agents who are paid commissions based on the annual policy premiums written. Workers’ compensation insurance pricing and coverage options are generally mandated and regulated on a state by state basis and provide coverage for the statutory obligations of employers to pay medical care expenses and lost wages for employees who are injured in the course of their employment. Commercial package products provide a broad array of insurance to small businesses, including commercial property, general liability, inland marine, automobile, workers’ compensation and umbrella coverage.
We believe the small business component of the workers’ compensation market is generally less competitive than the broader insurance market because the smaller policy size and low average premiums needed by these types of policyholders generally do not fit the underwriting and profitability criteria of many of our competitors. Our highly customized and proprietary technology platform enables us to individually underwrite, manage and control losses in a cost-effective manner for a large number of small policies while still providing quality customer service and responsive claims management to our clients and the agents that distribute our products. We believe these factors have been key to our ability to achieve high retention and renewal rates. 
Some of our commonly written small business risks include:

• | restaurants;


• | retail;


• | office and professional;


• | service industries;


• | schools;


• | hospitality;


• | light manufacturing;


• | wholesale operations;


• | auto service;


• | surety;


• | lumber;


• | community banks;


• | artisan contractors; and


• | not-for-profits.

We are focused on continuing to broaden our market share by enhancing our current agent relationships as well as developing new agent relationships. Our on-line rating and submission system permits agents and brokers to easily determine in real-time if the risk and pricing parameters for a prospective workers’ compensation client meet our underwriting criteria and delivers an application for underwriting approval to us in a paperless environment. Our underwriting system will not allow business to be

TABLE OF CONTENTS

placed if it does not fit within our guidelines. These same types of efficiencies also exist for our commercial package product business. Our system handles most clerical duties, so that our underwriters can focus on making decisions on risk submissions.
We administer all Small Commercial Business claims in house. Our claims management process is structured to provide prompt service and personal attention with a designated adjuster assigned to each case. Our system guides the insured and other involved parties through the claims adjudication process in an effort to allow them to return to normal business operations as soon as possible. We seek to limit the number of claim disputes with all parties through early intervention in the claims process. We use a proprietary system of internet-based tools and applications that enable our claims staff to concentrate on investigating submitted claims, to seek subrogation opportunities and to determine the actual amount of damages involved in each claim. This system allows the claims process to begin as soon as a claim is submitted.
Our workers’ compensation claims adjusters have an average of 23 years of experience and have teams located in nine different states. As of December 31, 2016, we employed 403 workers' compensation adjusters. Each adjuster handles an average monthly pending caseload of approximately 150 cases. Supervision of the adjusters is performed by internal supervisors and a claims manager in each region.
In 2016, approximately 76% of our Small Commercial Business workers’ compensation claims were for medical expenses only, while 24% of claims were for medical expenses and lost wages, compared with 75% and 25%, respectively, in 2015.
As of December 31, 2016, approximately 1.7% of the 31,011 Small Commercial Business workers’ compensation claims reported for accident year 2011 were open, 2.5% of the 39,141 claims reported for accident year 2012 were open, 3.8% of the 52,183 claims reported for accident year 2013 were open, 5.8% of the 74,266 claims reported for accident year 2014 were open, 10.8% of the 87,267 claims reported for accident year 2015 were open and 31.6% of the 83,708 claims reported for accident year 2016 were open.
We maintain Small Commercial Business property and casualty claims operations in several of our domestic offices. As of December 31, 2016, we employed 342 property and casualty claim adjusters. Overall, our property and casualty claims adjusters handle an average monthly pending caseload of approximately 128 claims.
As of December 31, 2016, our Small Commercial Business property and casualty claims were approximately 71% automobile and 9% property and inland marine, with the remaining 20% involving general liability and umbrella losses, compared to 63%, 9% and 28%, respectively, in 2015. At the end of 2016, 35% of the 33,053 claims reported in accident year 2016 remained open, while 22% and 15% of the 27,653 claims and 17,617 claims reported in accident years 2015 and 2014, respectively, remained open (the number of claims for 2015 and 2014 has been adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, but does not include Republic, which we expect would have a minimal impact on the percentages presented).
Our Small Commercial Business property and casualty claims adjusters have an average of 21 years of experience. Supervision of the adjusters is performed by our internal claims management, comprised of a staff that has an average of over 30 years of experience. Increases in reserves over the authority of the claims adjuster must be approved by supervisors up to such supervisor's authority. Above the supervisor limit, the reserve must be approved by the claims manager. If over the claims manager's authority limit, it must be approved by the regional vice president. If above the regional vice president's authority limit, it will be sent to the senior vice president for workers' compensation or commercial package products and/or the Chief Claims Officer.
In addition to growing organically, we have further enhanced our marketing and customer liaison capabilities for small-business workers’ compensation and property and casualty insurance by acquiring companies or distribution networks and renewal rights from companies that have long-standing, established agent relationships, underwriting and claims management expertise, and/or infrastructure to provide additional support to our platform. These transactions have also enabled us to further expand our geographic reach and offer additional products.
Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty
In our Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty segment we provide custom designed coverages, such as accidental damage plans and payment protection plans offered in connection with the sale of consumer and commercial goods in the United States and Europe, and certain niche property, casualty and specialty liability risks in the United States and Europe, including general liability, employers’ liability and professional and medical liability. Our model is focused on developing coverage plans by evaluating and analyzing historical product and industry data to establish appropriate pricing and contract terms and enhancing the profitability of the plans by limiting the frequency and severity of losses while delivering superior customer service. We own Lloyd's property and casualty insurance syndicates that focus on general insurance and provides access to Lloyd's underwriting platform for small brokers. We believe that our proprietary technology platform and strong industry expertise provide us a 
4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

competitive advantage. We carefully select administrators with extensive industry knowledge and target industries and coverage plans that have demonstrated consistently favorable loss experience. Additionally, we utilize extensive historical claims data and detailed actuarial analysis to ensure our ability to more accurately forecast the frequency and severity of losses and draft restrictive, risk-specific coverage terms with clearly identified coverage restrictions to further reduce the level of losses. Our efficient and proactive claims management process enables us to ensure superior customer service, and if necessary, proactively adjust our premiums based on changes in actual loss experience. Our specialty risk business primarily covers the following risks:

• | legal expenses in the event of unsuccessful litigation;


• | property damage for residential properties;


• | home emergency repairs caused by incidents affecting systems, such as plumbing, wiring or central heating;


• | latent defects that materialize on real property after building or completion;


• | payment protection to insureds if they become unable to meet financial obligations under finance contracts;


• | guaranteed asset protection (“GAP”) to cover the difference between an insurer’s settlement and the asset value in the event of a total loss; and


• | general liability, employers’ liability, public liability, negligence of advisers and liability of health care providers and medical facilities.

Our extended warranty business covers selected consumer and commercial goods and other risks, including:

• | automotive;


• | consumer electronics and appliances;


• | commercial equipment; and


• | recreational vehicle and power sports.

We also serve as a third party administrator to provide claims handling and call center services to the consumer products and automotive industries in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia.
In our extended warranty business, we issue policies to our clients that provide for payment or replacement of goods to meet our clients’ contractual liabilities to the end purchasers of the warranty under contracts that have coverage terms with durations ranging from one to 120 months depending on the type of product. In the event that the frequency or the severity of loss on the claims of a program exceeds original projections, we generally have the right to increase premium rates for the balance of the term of the contract and, in Europe, the right to cancel prior to the end of the term. We believe that the profitability of each coverage plan we underwrite is largely dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast the frequency and severity of claims and manage the claims process efficiently. We continuously collect and analyze claims data in order to forecast future claims trends. We also provide warranty administration services in the United States and internationally.
We underwrite our specialty risk coverage on a coverage plan-level basis, which involves substantial data collection and actuarial analysis as well as analysis of applicable laws governing policy coverage language and exclusions. We prefer to apply a historical rating approach in which we analyze historical loss experience of the covered product or similar products rather than an approach that attempts to estimate our total exposure without such historical data. In addition, we believe that the quality of the marketing and claims administration service provided by the warranty administrator is a significant driver of the profitability of the product. Accordingly, a critical evaluation of the prospective warranty administrator is an important component of underwriting a plan. The results of our underwriting analysis are used to determine the premium we charge and drive the description of the plan coverage and exclusions. The underwriting process generally takes three months or more to complete.
We market our extended warranty and GAP products in the United States and internationally primarily through brokers and third party warranty administrators, through a direct marketing group and our own warranty administrators AMT Warranty, Car Care and AmTrust International Limited. Third party administrators generally handle claims on our policies and provide monthly loss reports. We review the monthly reports and if the losses are unexpectedly high, we generally have the right under our policies to adjust our pricing or cease underwriting new business under the coverage plan. We routinely audit the claims paid by the administrators. We hire third party experts to validate certain types of claims. For example, we engage engineering consultants to validate claims made on coverage we provide on heavy machinery. We generally settle our extended warranty claims in-kind — by repair or replacement — rather than in cash. When possible, we negotiate volume fixed-fee repair or replacement agreements with third parties to reduce our loss exposure.
In 2016, approximately 57% of gross written premium for this segment originated internationally, while 43% originated in the United States. During 2016 and 2015, we did not derive over ten percent of our gross written premium from any one broker. In 2014, we derived over ten percent of our gross written premium in this segment from one broker.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Specialty Program
Our Specialty Program segment provides workers’ compensation, general liability, commercial auto liability, property coverage, excess and surplus lines programs and other specialty commercial property and casualty insurance to narrowly defined, homogeneous groups of small and middle market companies whose business model and risk profile generally requires in-depth knowledge of a specific industry or sector focus in order to appropriately evaluate, price and manage the coverage risk. The type of risk covered by this segment is similar to the type of risk in our Small Commercial Business segment but also covers, to a small extent, certain higher risk businesses. We partner with managing general agents and other wholesale agents and claims administrators who have a strong track record and history underwriting certain types of risk and who, subject to our underwriting standards, originate and assist in managing a book of business and generally share in the portfolio risk. Our products and underwriting criteria often entail customized coverage, loss control and claims services as well as risk sharing mechanisms. The coverage is offered through accounts with various agents to multiple insureds.
Policyholders in this segment primarily include the following types of industries:

• | public entities;


• | retail;


• | wholesale;


• | service operations;


• | artisan contracting;


• | trucking;


• | light and medium manufacturing;


• | habitational; and


• | professional employer organizations.

We establish the underwriting standards used with our agency partners by conducting detailed actuarial analysis using historical and industry data. Prior to entering into a relationship with an agency, we perform extensive due diligence on the agent including a review of underwriting, claims and financial control areas that generally takes three to nine months to complete. Additionally, once we have entered into a relationship with an agency, we carefully monitor the loss experience of the portfolio associated with each agent and conduct quarterly underwriting audits.
As of December 31, 2016, we underwrote 186 programs through 45 independent wholesale and managing general agents. Workers’ compensation insurance comprised approximately 46%, 41% and 37% of this business in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Other liability insurance comprised approximately 26%, 40% and 29% of this business in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Commercial auto liability and physical damage insurance combined comprised approximately 9%, 12% and 12% of this business in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Excess workers' compensation insurance comprised approximately 15%, 5% and 13% of this business in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During 2015 and 2014, we derived over ten percent of our gross written premium in this segment from one broker. During 2016, we did not derive over ten percent of our gross written premium from any one broker.
Distribution
We market our Small Commercial Business products through unaffiliated third parties that typically charge us a commission. We market our Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty products through unaffiliated third parties that, in lieu of a commission, charge an administrative fee, based on the policy amount, to the manufacturer or retailer that offers the extended warranty or accidental damage coverage plan. Accordingly, the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to motivate these third parties to sell our products and support them in their sales efforts. The Specialty Program business is distributed through a limited number of qualified general and wholesale agents who charge us a commission. We restrict our agent network to experienced, professional agents that have the requisite licensing to conduct business with us. We incentivize the sales organizations through profit sharing arrangements to assure the profitability of the business written.
Geographic Diversity
Our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the United States are collectively licensed to provide workers’ compensation insurance and commercial property and casualty insurance, including service contract reimbursement coverages related to our Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty segment, in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and in the year ended December 31, 2016, we wrote commercial property and casualty insurance in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Acquisitions and Strategic Investments
We have grown at an above-industry average rate through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions of other companies or selected books of businesses. We have balanced our opportunistic acquisition strategy with a conservative approach to risk. We will continue to evaluate the acquisition of companies, distribution networks and renewal rights, and other alternative types of transactions as they present themselves. We seek transactions that we believe can be accretive to earnings and return on equity. The following is a summary of our major acquisition and strategic investment activity during 2016 and 2015. For details of the impact of these acquisitions and strategic investments on our results of operations, see Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Acquisitions" and "– Strategic Investments."

Investment in National General Holdings Corp. 
We have an approximate 12% ownership interest in National General Holdings Corp. ("NGHC"). NGHC is a publicly-held specialty personal lines insurance holding company (Nasdaq: NGHC) that operates twenty-two insurance companies in the United States and provides a variety of insurance products, including personal and commercial automobile, homeowners and umbrella, and supplemental health. As of December 31, 2016, NGHC's two largest shareholders were the Michael Karfunkel Family 2005 Trust (the "Trust") and a grantor retained annuity trust controlled by Leah Karfunkel. Leah Karfunkel, who is co-trustee of the Trust along with Barry Zyskind, is a member of our Board of Directors, and the mother-in-law of Barry Zyskind, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. The ultimate beneficiaries of the Trust include Leah Karfunkel’s children, one of whom is married to Mr. Zyskind. In addition, Barry Karfunkel, the son of Leah Karfunkel and brother-in-law of Barry Zyskind, is the chief executive officer of NGHC and Barry Zyskind is NGHC's non-executive chairman of the board. In accordance with ASC 323-10-15, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures, we account for our investment in NGHC under the equity method as we have the ability to exert significant influence on NGHC's operations. 
In addition to our equity investment in NGHC, we provide NGHC and its affiliates information technology development services in connection with the development and licensing of a policy management system, and printing and mailing services for policy and policy related materials, such as invoices, quotes, notices and endorsements, associated with the policies we process for NGHC and its affiliates on the policy management system. We also manage the assets of certain of NGHC's subsidiaries, including the assets of reciprocal insurers managed by subsidiaries of NGHC, for an annual fee. For a more detailed description of our equity investment in NGHC and the services we provide to NGHC, see note 17. "Related Party Transactions."
Life Settlement Contracts
We have a 50% ownership interest in each of three entities (collectively, the “LSC Entities”) formed for the purpose of acquiring life settlement contracts, with a subsidiary of NGHC owning the remaining 50%. The LSC Entities are: Tiger Capital LLC (“Tiger”); AMT Capital Alpha, LLC (“AMT Alpha”); and AMT Capital Holdings, S.A. (“AMTCH”). 
A life settlement contract is a contract between the owner of a life insurance policy and a third-party who obtains the ownership and beneficiary rights of the underlying life insurance policy. During 2016, we terminated an agreement with a third party administrator of the Tiger and AMTCH life settlement contract portfolios, under which the third party received an administrative fee. The third party administrator was also eligible to receive a percentage of profits after certain time and performance thresholds had been met. We provide certain actuarial and finance functions related to the LSC Entities. In conjunction with our approximate 12% ownership percentage of NGHC, we ultimately receive 56% of the profits and losses of the LSC Entities. As such, in accordance with ASC 810-10, Consolidation, we have been deemed the primary beneficiary and, therefore, consolidate the LSC Entities. For a description of how we account for our investment in life settlement contracts, see Note 5. “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” and Note 7. “Investment in Life Settlements."
Reinsurance
Reinsurance is a transaction between insurance companies in which the original insurer, or ceding company, remits a portion of its policy premiums to a reinsurer, or assuming company, as payment for the reinsurer assuming a portion of the insured policies’ risk. Reinsurance agreements may be proportional in nature, under which the assuming company participates in the premiums and losses of the ceding company via a pro rata share. Under these “quota share reinsurance” arrangements, the ceding company transfers, or cedes, a percentage of the risk under each policy within the covered class or classes of business to the reinsurer and recovers the same percentage of the ceded loss and loss adjustment expenses. The ceding company pays the reinsurer that same percentage of the insurance premium on the ceded policies, less a ceding commission. Reinsurance agreements may also be 
10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

structured so that the assuming company indemnifies the ceding company against all or a specified portion of losses on underlying insurance policies in excess of a specified amount, which is called an “attachment level” or “retention.” The assuming company provides this indemnification for a premium, usually determined as a percentage of the ceding company’s insurance premiums for the covered class or classes of business. This arrangement is known as “excess of loss reinsurance.” Excess of loss reinsurance may be written in layers, in which a reinsurer or group of reinsurers accepts a band of coverage up to a specified amount. Any liability exceeding the coverage limits of the reinsurance program is retained by the ceding company. 
We believe reinsurance is a valuable tool to appropriately manage the risk inherent in our insurance portfolio as well as to enable us to reduce earnings volatility and generate stronger returns. We also utilize reinsurance agreements to increase our capacity to write a greater amount of profitable business. Our insurance subsidiaries utilize reinsurance agreements to transfer portions of the underlying risk of the business we write to various affiliated and third-party reinsurance companies. Reinsurance does not discharge or diminish our obligation to pay claims covered by the insurance policies we issue; however, it does permit us to recover certain incurred losses from our reinsurers and our reinsurance recoveries reduce the total aggregate of losses that we may incur as a result of a covered loss event. 
The total amount, cost and limits relating to the reinsurance coverage we purchase may vary from year to year based upon a variety of factors, including the availability of quality reinsurance at an acceptable price and the level of risk that we choose to retain for our own account. For a more detailed description of our reinsurance arrangements, including our quota share reinsurance agreement with Maiden Reinsurance Ltd. (“Maiden Reinsurance”) (the “Maiden Quota Share”), see “Reinsurance” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” appearing elsewhere in this 
Form 10-K.
Loss Reserves
Reserve Setting Approach - Overview
We record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write, as well as for loss adjustment expenses related to the investigation and settlement of claims. Our total reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at a given point in time. 
When a claim is reported, we establish an initial case reserve for the estimated amount of our loss based on our estimate of the most likely outcome of the claim at that time. Generally, a case reserve is established within 30 days after the claim is reported and consists of (depending on the insurance coverage) anticipated damages, liability, medical costs, indemnity costs and specific adjustment expenses, which we refer to as defense and cost containment expenses ("DCC"). At any point in time, the amount paid on a claim, plus the reserve for future amounts to be paid, represents the estimated total cost of the claim, or the case incurred amount. The term "loss" encompasses the amount required to settle a claim and the DCC related to the claim. 
The case incurred amount can vary over the life of the claim due to uncertainties with respect to claim specifics such as medical treatment and outcome, extent of liability becoming known over time, etc. As changes occur, the case incurred amount is adjusted. The initial estimate of the case incurred amount can vary significantly from the amount ultimately paid, especially in circumstances involving severe injuries with comprehensive medical treatment or complexities with the assignment or assessment of liability. Changes in case incurred amounts, or case development, are an important component of our historical claim data, which our actuaries use to estimate the ultimate value of our claims.
In addition to case reserves, we establish reserves on an aggregate basis for loss and DCC expenses that have been incurred but not reported, or IBNR. Our IBNR reserves are also intended to provide for aggregate changes in case incurred amounts (i.e., Incurred But Not Enough Reported, or "IBNER"), as well as the unpaid cost of claims incurred but for which an initial case reserve has not yet been established or the claim has not been reported yet ("pure" IBNR).
The third component of our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses is our adjusting and other reserve, or AO reserve. Our AO reserve is established for the costs of future unallocated loss adjustment expenses for all known and unknown claims. Our AO reserve primarily covers the estimated cost of administering claims through their final adjudication. The final component of our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses is the reserve for mandatory pooling arrangements.
11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Of the aforementioned reserve components, the IBNR recorded reserve balances represent Management’s Best Estimate ("MBE"), which we believe to be representative of the expected ultimate outcome in settling the insurance related liabilities incurred. Our process to arrive at the MBE incorporates actuarial estimations as indicated by the Actuarial Central Estimate ("ACE"), risks, uncertainties, and other relevant information pertaining to the underlying loss exposures and the company's operational activities. We use a combination of internal actuarial resources as well as external consulting actuaries to assist in the evaluation of the adequacy of our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses. 
Each quarter the determination of MBE begins with the actuarial analysis underlying the ACE. Management evaluates each of the component groups that comprises the ACE and the respective established actuarial methods used by our actuaries. Our internal actuarial analyses and procedures have strengthened in the recent year with the continued expansion of our actuarial staff, thereby adding enhanced rigor and diagnostic metrics to the actuarial analysis. 
Management may elect to deviate from the ACE in select cases, as management also considers other qualitative factors in selecting its MBE. Specifically, management considers current operational information provided by claims, underwriting and other operational personnel. Management may place greater reliance on this qualitative information to determine its best estimate of the liability, rather than the actuarial estimates indicated by the ACE. Management has instituted a robust process and governance committees to discuss, challenge, and critically assess any such deviations from the ACE.
Reserve Setting Process - Key Assumptions:

• | Initial Expected Loss Ratios ("IELR") by Line of Business - IELRs generally represent the expected current year underlying loss ratio with consideration to adjusting historical experience to current rate and trend level (“on-level” loss ratios);


• | Loss Development Factors - Loss development triangles compile historical claims data by origin period (e.g., Accident Year) and development period (e.g., annual evaluations). From this triangulation, loss development factors can be calculated as the ratio of losses at successive evaluations for a defined group of claims. Our actuarial resources, both internal and external, will generally evaluate loss development factors on both a reported loss and expense and paid loss and expense basis for both the industry and AmTrust specific experience; 


• | Claim frequency and severity trends by period; and


• | Average claim frequency and severity by period.

Reserve Setting Process - Key Methods:

▪ | Actual versus Expected. We monitor the performance of the business by monitoring the actual loss emergence (both paid and reported) during a period versus the expectation of the emergence based on the selected development assumptions from the prior period. 


▪ | Historical Development Methods. These may include the Paid and Reported Loss Development Methods. 


◦ | Loss Development Method Approaches. Loss development factors are applied to the latest valuation of actual incurred and paid losses and DCC, respectively, by year to estimate ultimate losses and DCC. 


▪ | Exposure-based Methods. This may include methods based on expectation of the business performance, such as the Expected Loss Ratio Method. 


◦ | Initial Expected Loss Ratio Approach. The Initial Expected Loss Ratio ("IELR") approach is generally relied upon for only the most recent accident periods while claims experience may be too immature or volatile to rely upon development methods projections of ultimate loss and DCC. The IELR is generally based on the business plan, trended historical results, or recent industry results, all supplemented by discussions with various stakeholders including Underwriting and Claims. The IELR, when applied to earned premium for an accident period, will provide an indication for estimated ultimate loss and DCC for the period.

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS


▪ | Credibility-Weighted Methods. These methods may include those which weight actual experience to date with an expectation of the business performance, such as the Paid and Reported Bornhuetter-Ferguson Methods. 


◦ | Bornhuetter-Ferguson ("BF") Approaches. The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method is a weighted blend of the Loss Development Method and Expected Loss Ratio approaches. The BF method splits the ultimate claims into two components: actual reported (or paid) claims to date and expected unreported (or unpaid) claims. As experience matures, more weight is given to the actual claims experience while the expected claims component becomes gradually less important. The key assumption to the BF methods is that unreported (or unpaid) claims will emerge (paid) at the selected expected loss ratio.

Exposure-based methods are most commonly used on relatively immature origin years while experience based methods provide a view based on the projection of loss experience that has emerged as of the valuation date. Greater reliance is placed upon experience-based methods as the pool of emerging loss experience grows and where it is deemed sufficiently credible and reliable as the basis for the estimate. In comparing the held reserve for any given origin year to the actuarial projections, judgment is required as to the credibility, uncertainty and inherent limitations of applying actuarial techniques to historical data to project future loss experience. 
Examples of factors that impact such judgments include, but are not limited to, the following: 

• | Nature and complexity of underlying coverage provided and net limits of exposure provided - as with all of our business, and certainly for new business for which limited or partial data exists, discussions with underwriters and claims adjusters are key to forming actuarial judgments;


• | Segmentation of data to provide sufficient homogeneity and credibility for loss projection methods;


• | Extent of credible internal historical loss data and reliance upon industry information as required;


• | Historical variability of actual loss emergence compared with expected loss emergence;


• | Extent of emerged loss experience relative to the remaining expected period of loss emergence;


• | Rate monitor information for new and renewal business;


• | Facts and circumstances of large claims; and


• | Impact of applicable reinsurance recoveries.

Loss development assumptions will consider internal experience, industry benchmark data (e.g. ISO, NCCI and various state related benchmarks available from State Bureaus) as necessary, and judgments regarding prospective influences of development that are different than recent historical experience.
Workers’ Compensation Business
Our process and methodology for estimating reserves applies to our voluntary business and does not include our reserves for mandatory pooling arrangements that we participate in as a condition of doing business in a state that establishes assigned risk plans to provide coverage for employers who cannot obtain coverage in the voluntary market. As is common practice, we record reserves for mandatory pooling arrangements as those reserves are reported to us by the pool administrators.
 The estimated amount of loss for a reported claim is based upon various factors, including:

• | type of loss;


• | severity of the injury or damage;


• | age and occupation of the injured employee;


• | estimated length of temporary disability;


• | anticipated permanent disability;


• | expected medical procedures, costs and duration;


• | our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim;


• | insurance policy provisions, including coverage, related to the claim;

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS


• | jurisdiction of the occurrence; and


• | other benefits defined by applicable statute.

The case incurred amount can vary due to uncertainties with respect to medical treatment and outcome, length and degree of disability, employment availability and wage levels and judicial determinations. As changes occur, the case incurred amount is adjusted. The initial estimate of the case incurred amount can vary significantly from the amount ultimately paid, especially in circumstances involving severe injuries with comprehensive medical treatment. Changes in case incurred amounts, or case development, are an important component of our historical claim data, which our actuaries use to estimate the ultimate value of our claims.
In order to establish IBNR reserves, we project ultimate losses by accident year both through use of our historical experience supplemented by industry experience. Our internal actuaries and external consulting actuaries project ultimate losses using the aforementioned generally accepted actuarial methods before selecting a result based on an evaluation of the method inputs.
Our actuaries will generally evaluate and/or incorporate industry loss development factors and compare indications based on those factors with the indications based on AmTrust specific factors. The use of industry loss development factors has generally produced higher estimates of workers’ compensation losses and DCC expenses.
Each method produces estimated ultimate loss and DCC expenses net of amounts that will be ultimately paid by our excess of loss reinsurers. Our actuaries estimate a range of ultimate losses, along with a selection that gives more weight to the results from our AmTrust specific loss development factors and less weight to the results from industry development factors. The IBNR implied by each actuarial method is arrived at by taking the method’s ultimate loss indication and subtracting the incurred losses and DCC to date.
Management establishes our loss and DCC IBNR reserves by assessing the results of the aforementioned actuarial techniques as prepared by both the internal and external actuarial resources, followed by a review of specific underwriting, claims handling and other operational considerations. In utilizing its judgment, management makes certain assumptions regarding our business, including, among other things, frequency of claims, severity of claims and claim closure rates.
As of December 31, 2016, our best estimate of our ultimate liability for workers’ compensation loss and loss adjustment expenses, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, was $2.2 billion, of which $106 million was reserves resulting from our participation in mandatory pooling arrangements, as reported by the pool administrators. This estimate was derived from the procedures and methods described above, which rely, substantially, on judgment.
The table below shows the carried reserves for workers’ compensation losses and DCC expenses on both a gross and net basis, as well as the actuarially determined range of reasonable estimates as of December 31, 2016:

(Amounts in Millions) | Loss & DCC Expense Reserves | | Mandatory Pooling Arrangements | | Total
Gross Workers’ Compensation Reserves: | | | | | | | 
Lower estimate | $ | 3,798 | | | $ | 106 | | $ | 3,904
Gross reserve | 4,220 | | | 106 | | | 4,326
Higher estimate | 4,642 | | | 106 | | | 4,748
Net Workers’ Compensation Reserves: | | | | | | | 
Lower estimate | $ | 1,914 | | | $ | 106 | | $ | 2,020
Net reserve | 2,127 | | | 106 | | | 2,233
Higher estimate | 2,340 | | | 106 | | | 2,446

The higher estimate would result in a reduction of income of $213 million, before tax, and $138.5 million, after tax. The lower net estimate would result in an increase of income of $213 million, before tax, and i$138.5 million, after tax. A change in our net loss and DCC expense reserve would not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, but would affect cash flows in future years as claim and expense payments are made.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

We do not anticipate that we will make any material reserve adjustments but will continue to monitor the accuracy of our loss development factors and adequacy of our reserves. For a more detailed description of our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss and loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”) on a consolidated basis and by segment, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty
Our net reserves, including IBNR, on Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $1,786 million and $1,006 million, respectively. An upward movement of 5% on overall reserves would result in a reduction of income in 2016 of $89.3 million before tax and $58.0 million after tax. A downward movement of 5% on overall reserves would result in an increase of income of $89.3 million before tax and $58.0 million after tax.
Our specialty risk and extended warranty business can largely be broken down into international property/casualty business and our domestic/international warranty business. The international property and casualty business includes, primarily, our medical malpractice business. Other exposures include professional indemnity, property, and legal expense insurance written by both our Lloyd’s syndicates and international statutory entities.
The estimated amount of loss for a reported claim is based upon various factors, including:
•line of business - medical malpractice, property, professional liability, etc.;
•severity of injury or property damage;
•statute of limitation and repose;
•insurance policy provisions, especially applicable policy limits and coverage limitations;
•expected medical procedures, costs and duration of treatment;
•our knowledge of circumstances surrounding the claim; and
•potential salvage and subrogation.
Case incurred amounts can vary greatly over the life of a claim because of the uncertainties inherent in the estimates of severity of loss, costs of medical treatments, judicial rulings, litigation expenses, and other factors. As changes occur, the case reserves are adjusted. The initial estimate of a claim’s incurred amount can vary significantly from the amount ultimately paid when the claim is closed, especially in the circumstances involving litigation and severe personal injuries. Changes in case incurred amounts, or case development, are an important component of our historical claim data that is used by our actuaries to estimate the ultimate value of our claims.
In order to establish exposure IBNR reserves for our international property/casualty business, we project ultimate losses by underwriting year both through use of our historical experience supplemented by industry experience. Our internal actuaries and external consulting actuaries project ultimate losses using the aforementioned generally accepted actuarial methods before selecting a result based on an evaluation of the method inputs. Our actuaries will generally evaluate and/or incorporate industry loss development factors and compare indications based on those factors with the indications based on AmTrust specific factors. 
Particularly for our medical malpractice exposure, we utilize a mix of actuarial techniques, which include the key actuarial methods described above and stochastic methods. Stochastic methods rely on claim frequency and severity assumptions for which we model simulations of claims experience. In cases where historical data may be limited, we may place reliance on external benchmarks or internal data of similar risk exposures to develop the modeling assumptions.
Each actuarial method produces estimated ultimate loss and DCC expenses net of amounts that will be ultimately paid by our excess of loss reinsurers. Our actuaries estimate a range of ultimate losses, along with a selection that gives more weight to the results from our AmTrust specific loss development factors and less weight to the results from industry development factors. The IBNR implied by each actuarial method is arrived at by taking the method’s ultimate loss indication and subtracting the incurred losses and DCC to date.
Management establishes our loss and DCC IBNR reserves by assessing the results of the aforementioned actuarial techniques as prepared by both the internal and external actuarial resources, followed by a review of specific underwriting, claims handling and other operational considerations. In utilizing its judgment, management makes certain assumptions regarding our business, including, among other things, frequency of claims, severity of claims and claim closure rates.
Our international and domestic warranty business consists of claims which are usually paid quickly, and for which development on known claims is negligible, and generally, case reserves are not established. IBNR reserves for warranty claims are generally 
15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

“pure” IBNR, which refers to amounts for claims that occurred prior to an accounting date but are reported after that date. The reporting lag for warranty IBNR claims is generally small, usually in the range of one to three months.
Management determines warranty IBNR by examining the experience of individual coverage plans. Our internal actuarial staff frequently reviews our IBNR by looking at our overall coverage plan experience and assessing the assumptions around claim reporting lag and average monthly claim payouts.
As pertains to our warranty business, there is generally more uncertainty in the unearned premium reserve than in the IBNR reserve. While our warranty claims are short-tailed, the unearned portion of each contract earns over several years. Furthermore, as pertains to warranty, claims are generally reported immediately after they occur and are closed within months of reporting. The reserve for unearned premium is related to the portion of premiums written that is applicable to the unexpired term of the contract or policy in force. Insurance premiums on Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty programs are earned based on an estimated program coverage period. A portion of the premium for these policies does not earn evenly over the contract period. Instead, the premium is earned in proportion to the exposure to losses and the amount of insurance protection provided. As of December 31, 2016, we had unearned premium of approximately $925 million on these policies. An upward/downward movement of 5% on the unearned premium for these policies would result in an increase/decrease of approximately $46.3 million. In 2016, we had no material changes to prior period estimates of these claim patterns. Our liability for return of unearned premium is not significant.
The reserve for unearned premium is calculated by analyzing each coverage plan separately, subdivided by contract year, type of product and length of contract. These individual reserve calculations may differ in actuarial methodologies depending on:

• | the type of risk;


• | the length of the exposure period;


• | the availability of past loss experience; and


• | the extent of current claim experience and potential experience of similar classes of risk underwritten by the program administrators.

The primary actuarial methodology used to project future losses for the unexpired terms of contracts is to project the future number of claims, then multiply them by an average claim cost. The future number of claims is derived by applying to unexpired months a selected ratio of the number of claims to expired months. The selected ratio is determined from a combination of:

• | past experience of the same expired policies;


• | current experience of the earned portion of the in-force policies or contracts; and


• | past and/or current experience of similar type policies or contracts.

The average claim cost is also determined by using past and/or current experience of the same or similar contracts. In order to confirm the validity of the projected future losses derived through application of the average claim cost method, we also utilize a loss ratio method. The loss ratio method entails the application of the projected ultimate loss ratio, which is based on historical experience, to the unearned portion of the premium. If the loss ratio method indicates that the average claim cost method has not produced a credible result for a particular coverage plan, we will make a judgment as to the appropriate reserve for that coverage plan. We generally will choose a point in the range between results generated by the average claim cost method and loss ratio method. In making our judgment, we consider, among other things, the historical performance of the subject coverage plan or similar plans, our analysis of the performance of the administrator and coverage terms.
Different Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty products have different patterns of incidence during the period of risk. Some products tend to show increasing incidence of claims during the risk period; others may show relatively uniform incidence of claims, while still others tend to show decreasing claim incidence. Incorrect earnings of warranty policy premiums, inadequate pricing of warranty products, changes in conditions during long contract durations or incorrect estimates of future warranty losses on unexpired contracts may produce a deficiency or a redundancy in the unearned premium reserve. Our net unearned premium reserve as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 for our Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty segment was $1,585 million and $1,296 million, respectively. Although we believe this is a reasonable best estimate of our unearned premium reserve, this amount is subject to a substantial degree of uncertainty.
Small Commercial Business (other than Workers' Compensation)
Our actual net reserves, including IBNR, for small commercial business insurance (other than workers' compensation) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $2,243 million and $1,480 million, respectively. An upward movement of 5% on overall reserves would result in a reduction of income in 2016 of $112 million before tax and $72.8 million after tax. A downward movement of 5% on overall reserves would result in an increase of income of $112 million before tax and $72.8 million after tax.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

We record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expenses related to the investigation and settlement of policy related claims. Our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated costs of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at a given point in time. In establishing our small commercial business (other than workers' compensation) reserves, we do not use loss discounting, which involves recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income. 
The estimated amount of loss for a reported claim is based upon various factors, such as:

• | line of business — general liability, auto liability, or auto physical damage;


• | severity of injury or property damage;


• | number of claimants;


• | statute of limitation and repose;


• | insurance policy provisions, especially applicable policy limits and coverage limitations;


• | expected medical procedures, costs, and duration of treatment;


• | our knowledge of circumstances surrounding the claim; and


• | potential salvage and subrogation.

Case incurred amounts can vary greatly over the life of a claim because of the uncertainties inherent in the estimates of severity of loss, costs of medical treatments, judicial rulings, litigation expenses, and other factors. As changes occur, the case reserves are adjusted. The initial estimate of a claim’s incurred amount can vary significantly from the amount ultimately paid when the claim is closed, especially in the circumstances involving litigation and severe personal injuries. Changes in case incurred amounts, or case development, are an important component of our historical claim data that is used by our actuaries to estimate the ultimate value of our claims.
In order to establish IBNR reserves, we project ultimate losses by accident year both through use of our historical experience supplemented by industry experience by comparable line of business. Our internal actuaries and external consulting actuaries project ultimate losses using the aforementioned generally accepted actuarial methods before selecting a result based on an evaluation of the method inputs.
Our actuaries will generally evaluate and/or incorporate industry loss development factors and compare indications based on those factors with the indications based on AmTrust specific factors. When compared to our workers’ compensation business, we rely more heavily on industry benchmarks for our small commercial business (other than workers' compensation) lines because of our relative lack of experience in these lines. Because we determine our reserves based on assumptions that may give significant weight to industry incurred development patterns, our ultimate losses may differ substantially from our estimates produced by the above methods.
We began writing additional lines of business beyond workers' compensation in 2006. These include, but are not limited to, general liability, commercial auto and commercial property (jointly known as CPP). In 2008, we acquired retail commercial package business in connection with our acquisition of a subsidiary of Unitrin, Inc. (“UBI”). We were able to access UBI’s historical loss data for analysis of that business. Additionally, the claims adjusting has remained stable. As the volume of AmTrust specific experience grows, we will give additional weight to loss development factors implied from our own actual experience.
Each method produces estimated ultimate loss and DCC expenses net of amounts that will be ultimately paid by our excess of loss reinsurers. The resulting IBNR implied by each actuarial method is arrived at by taking the method’s ultimate loss indication and subtracting the incurred losses and DCC to date.
Management establishes our loss and DCC IBNR reserves by assessing the results of the aforementioned actuarial techniques as prepared by both the internal and external actuarial resources, followed by a review of specific underwriting, claims handling and other operational considerations. In utilizing its judgment, management makes certain assumptions regarding our business, including, among other things, frequency of claims, severity of claims and claim closure rates.
In order to establish our AO reserves, we review our historical adjustment expenses in relation to historical claims and estimate our future costs based on expected claims activity and duration.
A reconciliation of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and information regarding loss and loss adjustment expense reserve development appears in Note 12. "Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves" and Note 13. "Short Duration Contracts," respectively, in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Our investments in equity securities, which are either classified as available-for-sale or trading, constitute approximately 2.5% of our total investment portfolio. For the equity securities classified as available-for-sale, we generally split them into two types of investment categories. One category consists mainly of large capitalized companies, for which the individual investments are generally liquid in nature and their market prices are typically reflective of their value. The second category is small capitalized companies with an average market capitalization of approximately $400 million, most without widespread distribution or trading of shares. We have invested in securities in the second category in which we believe true value is not properly reflected in the market price and where a catalyst, or event, will send the market price toward our estimate of true value. We typically have a holding period of 36 months for these equity securities. This catalyst, in many instances, takes up to 24-months to occur. Sometimes, a catalyst that does not occur soon after our initial investment requires the passage of another operating cycle, and the 24 month time frame allows for these types of situations. These equity securities tend to be relatively unknown stocks that have less trading

volume than well-known or larger capitalized stocks and can, therefore, experience significant price fluctuations without fundamental reasons. These price fluctuations can be large on a percentage basis because many stocks in this category are also low-priced stocks that are often distressed or in a turnaround phase. We believe that in down markets, equity securities with lower turnover are more heavily penalized by the market, even when the underlying fundamentals of the security have held up. Therefore, we believe, and our experience bears out, that, for investments in small cap stocks, an unrealized loss of 35% or less is not necessarily indicative of a fundamental problem with the issuer. Prices of lower turnover stocks can also react significantly to a catalyst or an event that causes market participants to take an interest. When the market participants’ interest increases in an equity security, causing trading volume and market bid to increase, we typically seek to exit these positions. For these reasons, we generally consider certain equity investments in this small capitalization category to be other than temporarily impaired when the investment is in an unrealized loss position in excess of 35% of cost basis for greater than 24 months.
We generally purchase life settlement contracts through secondary market transactions. The policies we purchase are universal life insurance policies issued by rated life insurance companies. Before we purchase a life settlement contract, we conduct a rigorous underwriting review that includes obtaining life expectancy estimates on individual insureds from specialized life expectancy providers. The price we are willing to pay for a policy is primarily a function of: (i) the policy’s face value; (ii) the expected actuarial mortality of the insured; (iii) the premiums expected to be paid over the life of the insured; and (iv) market competition from other purchasers. We seek to earn profits by purchasing policies at discounts to the face value of the insurance benefit. The discounts at which we purchase are expected to exceed the costs necessary to pay premiums and financing and servicing costs through the date of the insured’s mortality.
Additional financial information regarding our investments is presented under the subheading “Investment Portfolio” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Certain International Tax Considerations
We operate our business in numerous foreign countries and are subject to taxation in these foreign jurisdictions. A brief description of our major international tax considerations that most materially affect us appears below. 
Bermuda
Bermuda currently does not impose any income, corporation or profits tax, withholding tax, capital gains tax or capital transfer tax on any of our Bermuda subsidiaries, or any estate duty or inheritance tax applicable to shares of any of our Bermuda subsidiaries (except in the case of shareholders resident in Bermuda). Except as set out in the following paragraph, our Bermuda subsidiaries may be subject to such Bermuda tax in the future.
Our significant operating Bermuda subsidiary, AmTrust International Insurance, Ltd. (“AII”), has received a written assurance from the Bermuda Minister of Finance under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 of Bermuda, as amended, that, if any legislation is enacted in Bermuda imposing tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition of that tax would not be applicable to these Bermuda subsidiaries or to any of their operations, shares, debentures or obligations until March 31, 2035; provided that the assurance is subject to the condition that it will not be construed to prevent the application of such tax to people ordinarily resident in Bermuda, or to prevent the application of any taxes payable by our Bermuda subsidiaries in respect of real property or leasehold interests in Bermuda held by them. Our Bermuda subsidiaries may be subject to any such tax after March 31, 2035.
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, AII is treated as a U.S. corporation that is subject to tax and is included in our consolidated U.S. tax return. 
The other remaining significant Bermuda operations are not currently subject to taxation in the U.S because these operations meet certain legislative exceptions in the Internal Revenue Code that allow for deferral of taxation on the earnings generated by these operations until such earnings are repatriated to the U.S.
Ireland
AmTrust International Underwriters DAC (“AIU”), a company incorporated in Ireland, is resident in Ireland for Irish tax purposes and subject to Irish corporation tax on its worldwide profits (including revenue profits and capital gains). Income derived by AIU from an Irish trade is subject to Irish corporation tax at the current rate of 12.5%. 
19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, AIU is a controlled foreign corporation and its earnings generally are included in our U.S. federal taxable income. A credit against U.S. federal income tax liability is available for any Irish tax paid on such earnings.
The other remaining Irish operations are not currently subject to taxation in the U.S. because these operations meet certain legislative exceptions in the Internal Revenue Code that allow for deferral of taxation on the earnings generated by these operations until such earnings are repatriated to the U.S. 
Luxembourg
 AmTrust Holdings Luxembourg S.A.R.L (“AHL”), a Luxembourg holding company, is resident in Luxembourg for tax purposes and subject to Luxembourg corporation tax on its profits (including revenue profits and capital gains). Earnings derived by AHL and its Luxembourg domiciled subsidiaries are subject to Luxembourg corporation tax at the rate of approximately 30%.
All of the Luxembourg-domiciled entities are also subject to a Net Wealth Tax of 0.5% on their net wealth based on prescribed valuation methods. 
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, AHL and all of its subsidiaries are controlled foreign corporations and their earnings generally are included in our U.S. federal taxable income. A credit against U.S. federal income tax liability is available for any Luxembourg income tax paid on such earnings.
United Kingdom
AmTrust International Limited ("AIL"), a company incorporated in the United Kingdom, is subject to corporation tax on its worldwide profits (including revenue profits and capital gains). Earnings derived by AIL and its U.K. domiciled subsidiaries are subject to British corporation tax at the rate of 20%. 
AIL's subsidiaries domiciled outside of the U.K. are subject to taxation in their respective countries. 
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, AIL and all of its subsidiaries are controlled foreign corporations and their earnings are generally deferred from inclusion in our U.S. federal taxable income. If a portion of the earnings is either deemed repatriated or actually repatriated, a credit against U.S. federal income tax liability is available for any local income taxes paid on such earnings.
Ratings
Our principal insurance subsidiaries are rated “A” (Excellent) by A.M. Best. An “A” rating is the third highest of the 16 categories used by A.M. Best, and is assigned to companies that have, in A.M. Best’s opinion, an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders. Many insurance buyers, agents and brokers use the ratings assigned by A.M. Best and other agencies to assist them in assessing the financial strength and overall quality of the companies from which they are considering purchasing insurance.
These ratings were derived from an in-depth evaluation of these subsidiaries’ balance sheets strengths, operating performances and business profiles. A.M. Best evaluates, among other factors, our capitalization, underwriting leverage, financial leverage, asset leverage, capital structure, quality and appropriateness of reinsurance, adequacy of reserves, quality and diversification of assets, liquidity, profitability, spread of risk, revenue composition, market position, management, market risk and event risk. A.M. Best ratings are intended to provide an independent opinion of an insurer’s ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not an evaluation directed at investors.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Regulation
General
The business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in most countries, although the degree and type of regulation vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another. We are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and in Europe, which for us primarily consists of the United Kingdom and Ireland, as well as in Bermuda.
United States
As of December 31, 2016, we had twenty-four operating insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the United States (the “U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries”).
Holding Company Regulation
We qualify as a holding company system under laws that regulate insurance holding company systems. Each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory agency of its state of domicile (and in any other state in which the insurance company may be deemed to be commercially domiciled by reason of concentration of its business within such state) and periodically furnish information concerning its ownership, operations and transactions, particularly with other companies within the holding company system that may materially affect its operations, management or financial condition.
The insurance laws in most states provide that all transactions among members of an insurance holding company system must be fair and reasonable. These laws require disclosure of material transactions within the holding company system and, in some cases, prior notice of or approval for certain transactions. All transactions within a holding company system affecting an insurer must have fair and reasonable terms and are subject to other standards and requirements established by law and regulation.
Dividends
State insurance laws require our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries to maintain certain levels of policyholders’ surplus and restrict payment of dividends. In general, the maximum amount of dividends a U.S. Insurance Subsidiary may pay in any 12-month period without prior regulatory approval is the greater of adjusted statutory net income or 10% of statutory policyholders’ surplus as of the preceding calendar year end. Most states restrict an insurance company’s ability to pay dividends in excess of its statutory unassigned surplus or earned surplus, and state insurance regulators may limit or restrict an insurance company’s ability to pay dividends, if such a dividend has been paid within the previous year, as a condition to issuance of a certificate of authority or as a condition to approval of a change of control, or for other regulatory reasons.
Change of Control
State insurance holding company laws require advance approval by the respective state insurance departments of any change of control of an insurer. Control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of 10% or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or any entity that controls a domestic insurance company. In addition, insurance laws in many states contain provisions that require pre- and post-notification to and prior approval from the insurance departments of a change of control of certain non-domestic insurance companies licensed in those states, as well as post-notification of a change of control of certain agencies and third party administrators. Obtaining these approvals may result in the material delay of, or deter, any such transaction. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of AmTrust, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable.
State Insurance Regulation
Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the department of insurance in the state in which they are domiciled and, to a lesser extent, other states in which they are authorized to conduct business. The primary purpose of such regulatory powers is to protect individual policyholders. State insurance authorities have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers. For example, our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries’ policy rates and forms, including workers’ compensation policies, are closely regulated in all states. Workers’ compensation insurers are also subject to regulation by the specific workers’ compensation regulators in the states in which they provide such insurance.
21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries are required to file detailed financial statements and other reports with the departments of insurance in all states in which they are licensed to transact business. These reports include details concerning claims reserves held by the insurer, specific investments held by the insurer, and numerous other disclosures about the insurer’s financial condition and operations. These financial statements are subject to periodic examination by the department of insurance in each state in which they are filed. The quarterly and annual financial reports to the state insurance regulators utilize statutory accounting principles ("SAP"), which are different from GAAP. Statutory accounting principles are a basis of accounting developed to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies, and are primarily focused on protection of policyholders. GAAP focuses more on income and cash flows, and gives more consideration to appropriately matching revenue and expenses, and accounting for management's stewardship of assets.
State insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate and limit the amounts and types of investments that insurers are permitted to make. Certain investments (such as real estate) are prohibited by certain jurisdictions. Each of our domiciliary states has its own regulations and limitations over investments. To ensure compliance in each state, we review our investment portfolio quarterly based on each state’s regulations and limitations.
In addition, many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to withdraw from a particular market or particular line of business. For example, states may limit an insurer’s ability to cancel or not renew policies. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict the ability of our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries to exit unprofitable markets.
Insurance agencies, producers, third party administrators, claims adjusters and service contract providers and administrators are subject to licensing requirements and regulation by insurance regulators in various states in which they conduct business. Many of our subsidiaries and certain of our employees are subject to licensing requirements and regulation by insurance regulators in various states.
Federal and State Legislative and Regulatory Changes
From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the insurance industry. Among the proposals that have in the past been or are at present being considered are the possible introduction of federal regulation in addition to, or in lieu of, the current system of state regulation of insurers and proposals in various state legislatures (some of which have been enacted) to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model acts adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). The NAIC has undertaken a Solvency Modernization Initiative focused on updating the U.S. insurance solvency regulatory framework, including capital requirements, governance and risk management, group supervision, accounting and financial reporting and reinsurance. The NAIC has adopted amendments to the Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and the Insurance Holding Company System Model Regulation to introduce the concept of “enterprise risk” within an insurance company holding system. The amendments impose more extensive informational requirements on insurers in order to protect the licensed insurance companies from enterprise risk, and have been adopted in all the states in which our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries are domiciled. Additionally, the NAIC has adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) Model Act, which requires insurers to perform an ORSA and, upon request of a state, file an ORSA Summary Report with the state. Also, as part of the Solvency Modernization Initiative, the NAIC has adopted the Corporate Governance Annual Filing Model Regulation and the Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Act became effective in 2016, which requires us to file a confidential report prepared by the insurer or insurance group, the purpose of which is to provide the most relevant information necessary to permit state regulators to gain an understanding of the corporate governance structure, policies and practices utilized by the insurer.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) established a Federal Insurance Office (the “FIO”) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The FIO was initially charged with monitoring certain aspects of the insurance industry, gathering data, and conducting a study on methods to modernize and improve the insurance regulatory system in the United States. In 2013, the FIO issued a report recommending that Congress consider direct federal involvement should the states fail to accomplish necessary modernization reforms in the near term. The FIO continues to support the current state-based regulatory regime, but may consider federal regulation should the states fail to take steps to achieve greater uniformity.
 In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the Federal Reserve supervisory authority over a number of financial services companies, including insurance companies, if they are designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as “systemically important.” In such a case, the Federal Reserve’s supervisory authority could include the ability to impose heightened financial regulation upon that insurance company and could impact its capital, liquidity and leverage requirements as well as its business and investment conduct. We have not been designed as "systemically important" by the Financial Stability Oversight Council.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (“TRIA”), as extended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“TRIPRA”), requires that commercial property and casualty insurance companies, like our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries, offer coverage (with certain exceptions, such as with respect to commercial auto liability) for certain acts of terrorism and has established a federal assistance program through the end of 2020 to help such insurers cover claims for terrorism-related losses. 
Specific federal regulatory developments include the introduction of legislation in Congress that would repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act antitrust exemption for the insurance industry. The antitrust exemption allows insurers to compile and share loss data, develop standard policy forms and manuals and predict future loss costs with greater reliability, among other things. The ability of the industry, under the exemption permitted in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, to collect loss cost data and build a credible database as a means of predicting future loss costs is an important part of cost-based pricing. If the ability to collect this data were removed, the predictability of future loss costs and the reliability of pricing could be undermined.
State Insurance Department Examinations
As part of their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed and risk-focused financial examinations of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC.
A second type of regulatory oversight examination of insurance companies involves a review by an insurance department of an authorized company’s market conduct, which entails a review and examination of a company’s compliance with laws governing marketing, underwriting, rating, policy-issuance, claims-handling and other aspects of its insurance business during a specified period of time. Our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries are subject to both types of these examinations from time to time. Any adverse findings by state insurance departments could result in significant fines and penalties, which could negatively affect profitability.
Guaranty Fund Assessments
 Various states levy assessments on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by the member insurers in the lines of business in which impaired, insolvent or failed insurers are engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. Our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries have established accruals for their portion of guaranty fund assessments with respect to insurers that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings.
Residual Market Programs
Many states require insurers licensed to provide workers’ compensation and commercial automobile insurance to participate in a residual market program to provide these types of insurance to those entities that have not or cannot procure coverage from an insurer on a voluntary basis. The level of required participation is generally determined based on an insurer’s volume of the voluntarily issued business in that state. The mechanics of how each state’s residual markets operate may differ, but generally, risks are assigned to a servicing carrier pursuant to a state administered plan (“Assigned Risk Plans”), which is reinsured through a pooling arrangement where the results of all policies provided through these administered pools are shared by the participating companies.
Our U.S. Insurance Subsidiary, Technology Insurance Company, Inc. (“TIC”), acts as a servicing carrier for the workers’ compensation Assigned Risk Plans. Servicing carrier contracts are generally awarded based on a competitive bidding process. As a servicing carrier, we receive fee income for our services but do not retain any underwriting risk, which is fully reinsured by the various National Council on Compensation Insurance ("NCCI") pools. 
Second Injury Funds
A number of states operate trust funds that reimburse insurers and employers for claims paid to injured employees for aggravation of prior conditions or injuries. These state-managed trust funds are funded through assessments against insurers and self-insurers providing workers’ compensation coverage in a particular state. We received recoveries of approximately $4.3 million, $6.1 million and $5.7 million from such state-managed trust funds in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The aggregate amount of cash we paid for assessments to state-managed trust funds for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $25.8 million, $23.4 million and $14.6 million, respectively.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Risk-Based Capital Regulations
Our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries are required to report their risk-based capital based on a formula developed and adopted by the NAIC that attempts to measure statutory capital and surplus needs based on the risks in the insurer’s mix of products and investment portfolio. The formula is designed to allow insurance regulators to identify weakly-capitalized companies. Under the formula, a company determines its “risk-based capital” by taking into account certain risks related to the insurer’s assets (including risks related to its investment portfolio and ceded reinsurance) and the insurer’s liabilities (including underwriting risks related to the nature and experience of its insurance business). The insurance departments in our domiciliary states generally require a minimum total adjusted risk-based capital equal to 150% of an insurance company’s authorized control level risk-based capital. At December 31, 2016, our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries’ risk-based capital levels exceeded the minimum requirements.
Insurance Regulatory Information System Ratios
The NAIC Insurance Regulatory Information System, or IRIS, is part of a collection of analytical tools designed to provide state insurance regulators with an integrated approach to screening and analyzing the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states, and is intended to assist state insurance regulators in targeting resources to those insurers in greatest need of regulatory attention. IRIS generates key financial ratios results based on financial information obtained from insurers’ annual statutory statements. Each ratio has an established “usual range” of results. Unusual values are viewed as part of a regulatory early monitoring system. An insurance company may fall out of the usual range for one or more ratios because of specific transactions that are in themselves immaterial or because of certain reinsurance or pooling structures or changes in such structures. Management does not anticipate regulatory action as a result of any 2016 IRIS ratio results outside the usual range for our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries. In all instances in prior years, regulators have been satisfied upon follow-up that no regulatory action was required with respect to any ratio outside of the usual range.
Credit for Reinsurance
In addition to regulatory requirements imposed by the jurisdictions in which they are licensed, reinsurers’ business operations are affected by regulatory requirements in various states governing “credit for reinsurance” that are imposed on their ceding companies. The Non-Admitted and Reinsurance Reform Act (“NRRA”) prohibits a state in which a U.S. ceding insurer is licensed but not domiciled from denying credit for reinsurance for the insurer’s ceded risk if the cedant’s domestic state regulator recognizes credit for reinsurance. The ceding company in this instance is permitted to reflect in its statutory financial statements a credit in an aggregate amount equal to the ceding company’s liability for unearned premium (which are that portion of premiums written that apply to the unexpired portion of the policy period), loss reserves and loss expense reserves to the extent ceded to the reinsurer. AII, which reinsures risks of our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries, is not licensed, accredited or approved in any state in the U.S. The great majority of states, however, permit a credit to statutory surplus resulting from reinsurance obtained from a non-licensed or non-accredited reinsurer to be recognized to the extent that the reinsurer provides a letter of credit, trust fund or other acceptable security arrangement. AII posts security to permit our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries to receive credit for reinsurance on business ceded to AII pursuant to our intercompany reinsurance agreements.
Privacy Regulations
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which, among other things, protects consumers from the unauthorized dissemination of certain personal information, and various states’ regulations address privacy issues. Certain aspects of these laws and regulations apply to all financial institutions, including insurance and finance companies, and require us to maintain appropriate policies and procedures for managing and protecting certain personal information of our policyholders. We may also be subject to future privacy laws and regulations, which could impose additional costs and impact our results of operations or financial condition. Model regulations have been established in conjunction with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and similar provisions have been adopted in several states regarding the safeguarding of policyholder information. To the best of our knowledge, we are in compliance with all applicable privacy laws and regulations.
Telephone and Email Sales Regulations
The U.S. Congress, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and various states have promulgated and enacted rules and laws that govern telephone and email solicitations. There are numerous state statutes and regulations governing telephone sales activities and email solicitations that do or may apply to our operations, including the operations of our call centers. Federal and state “Do Not Call” regulations must be followed for us to engage in telephone sales activities. In addition, both the federal and state statutes have rules governing commercial email messages restricting the content of the messages, as well as the method and manner of distribution, including requiring certain opt-out mechanisms.

Regulatory Coordination 
State regulators in the United States and regulatory agencies outside the United States are increasingly coordinating the regulation of internationally active insurance groups through participation in supervisory colleges. A supervisory college, as defined by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, is a forum for cooperation and communication between the involved supervisors established for the fundamental purpose of facilitating the effectiveness of supervision of entities that belong to an insurance group; facilitating both the supervision of the group as a whole on a group-wide basis; and improving the legal entity supervision of the entities within the insurance group. Our regulators conducted a supervisory college for our insurance group in 2015.
Ireland
AIU is a non-life insurance company organized under the laws of Ireland, and is subject to the regulation and supervision of the Central Bank of Ireland (the “Central Bank”) pursuant to the Insurance Acts 1909 to 2000, as amended (the “Insurance Acts”), and the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015 (the “Regulations”). AIU is authorized to underwrite various classes of non-life insurance business, and, as an Irish authorized insurance company, is permitted to carry on insurance business in any other member state of the European Economic Area by way of freedom to provide services, on the basis that it has notified the Central Bank of its intention to do so, or by way of freedom of establishment, subject to the approval of the Central Bank, and subject to complying with such conditions as may be laid down by the regulator of the jurisdiction in which the insurance activities are carried out for reasons of the “general good.”
Qualifying Shareholders
The Insurance Acts and Regulations require that anyone acquiring or disposing of a direct or indirect holding in an insurance company that represents 10% or more of the capital or voting rights of such company or makes it possible to exercise a significant influence over management of the company (“qualifying holding”) in an insurance company (such as AIU), or anyone who proposes to decrease or increase that holding to 20%, 33%, 50% or such other level of ownership that results in the insurance company becoming the acquirer’s subsidiary (“specified levels”), must first notify the Central Bank of their intention to do so. It also requires any insurance company that becomes aware of any acquisitions or disposals of its capital, such that such holdings amount to a qualifying holding exceeding or falling below the specified levels, to notify the Central Bank. If the Central Bank is not satisfied as to the suitability of the acquirer in view of the necessity to ensure the sound and prudent management of the insurance undertaking, it may oppose the proposed transaction. Under the European Communities (Assessment of Acquisitions in the Financial Sector) Regulations 2009, there is a strict time-frame for the assessment of a proposed transaction, which may take up to 80 working days. 
Any person having a shareholding of 10% or more of the issued share capital in AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. or AmTrust Equity Solutions, Ltd. (the direct parent of AIU) or a 20% or more holding in the intermediate companies between AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. and AmTrust Equity Solutions, Ltd. would be considered to have an indirect holding in AIU at or over the 20% limit. Any change that resulted in the indirect acquisition or disposal of a shareholding of greater than or equal to 10% in the share capital of AIU, or a change that resulted in an increase to or decrease below one of the specified levels, would need to be approved with the Central Bank prior to the transaction. The Central Bank’s approval would be required if any person were to acquire a shareholding equal to or in excess of 10% of AIU’s outstanding common stock or in excess of one of the specified levels.
AIU is required, at such times as may be specified by the Central Bank, and at least once a year, to notify the Central Bank of the names of shareholders possessing qualifying holdings and the size of such holdings.
Restrictions on Dividends
As a matter of Irish company law, AIU is restricted to declaring dividends only out of profits available for distribution, which are a company’s accumulated realized profits less its accumulated realized losses. Such profits may not include profits previously distributed or capitalized and such losses do not include amounts previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital.

Bermuda
Classification
AII is registered as an insurer by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (“BMA”) under the Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda, as amended (the “Insurance Act - Bermuda”). The BMA is responsible for the day-to-day supervision of insurers and monitors compliance with the solvency and liquidity standards imposed by the Insurance Act - Bermuda. Since January 1, 2016, AII has been registered as a Class 3B insurer. Accordingly, AII can carry on general business, broadly including all types of insurance business other than long-term business. AII is also licensed as a Class C insurer to carry on long-term business, which broadly includes life insurance and disability insurance with terms in excess of five years. 
Annual and Quarterly Financial Statements, Annual Statutory Financial Return and Annual Capital and Solvency Return
AII is required to file annually with the BMA financial statements, a statutory financial return and a capital and solvency return, and file quarterly financial statements. The statutory financial return for an insurer includes, among other matters, statutory financial statements, a report of the approved auditor on the statutory financial statements, and, a declaration of compliance confirming compliance with various minimum criteria, including certifying the company meets the minimum solvency margin. Where an insurer’s accounts have been audited for any purpose other than compliance with the Insurance Act - Bermuda, an express statement to that effect must be filed with the statutory financial return. The capital and solvency return includes AII's Bermuda Solvency Capital Return model for a Class 3B insurer, a commercial insurer's solvency self-assessment, a catastrophe risk return and a schedule of loss triangles or reconciliation of net loss reserves, schedule of solvency, financial condition report, an opinion of the company’s loss reserve specialist, a schedule of eligible capital and an economic balance sheet. The capital and solvency return also includes a capital and solvency declaration that the return fairly represents the financial condition of AII in all material respects. AII is also required to file audited U.S. GAAP annual financial statements, which are published by the BMA.
Insurance Code of Conduct
The Insurance Code of Conduct prescribes the duties and standards with which registered insurers must adhere and comply, to ensure that the registered insurer implements sound corporate governance, risk management and internal controls. Failure to comply with these requirements is a factor considered by the BMA in determining whether an insurer is conducting its business in a sound and prudent manner. Any failure to comply with the requirements of the Insurance Code of Conduct could result in the BMA exercising its statutory powers of intervention.
Minimum Solvency Margin, Enhanced Capital Requirement and Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions
Under the Insurance Act - Bermuda, the value of the general business assets of a registered Class 3B insurer, such as AII, must exceed the amount of its general business liabilities by an amount greater than the prescribed minimum solvency margin. AII is required, with respect to its general business, to maintain a minimum solvency margin equal to the greatest of: 25% of the enhanced capital requirement ("ECR"); $1.0 million; 20% of net premiums written up to $6.0 million plus 15% of net premiums written over $6.0 million; and 15% of loss and other insurance reserves. AII is also required to maintain available statutory capital and surplus at least equal to its ECR. The BMA has also established a target capital level (“TCL”) for each insurer subject to an enhanced capital requirement equal to 120% of its ECR. Failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the TCL would likely result in increased regulatory oversight.
AII could not declare or pay dividends during any financial year if it is in breach of its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio or if it would fail to meet such margin or ratio as a result. In addition, BMA approval would be required prior to declaring or paying dividends in any financial year AII failed to meet its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year.
As a registered Class 3B insurer, AII is prohibited from declaring or paying dividends of more than 25% of its previous year’s total statutory capital and surplus unless it files with the BMA an affidavit stating it will continue to meet its minimum capital requirements. In addition, AII is prohibited, without the approval of the BMA, from reducing by 15% or more its total statutory capital as set out in its previous year’s financial statements. 
As a registered Class C long-term insurer, AII is required to establish and maintain a long-term business fund and no payment may be made directly or indirectly from AII’s long-term business fund for any purpose other than a purpose related to AII’s long-term business, unless such payment can be made out of any surplus certified by AII’s approved actuary to be available for distribution otherwise than to policyholders. With respect to its long-term business, AII must maintain a minimum solvency margin of the greater of $0.5 million or 1.5% of assets and certain additional restrictions apply to AII’s ability to declare or pay dividends. AII’s

approved actuary must certify that AII’s long-term business assets exceeds its long-term business liabilities (based on Bermuda’s Economic Balance Sheet technical provisions) by the amount of the dividend and the greater of $0.5 million or 1.5% of assets, and any such dividend shall not exceed the aggregate of such excess and other funds properly available for the payment of dividends. AII applies annually for an exemption from the Bermuda Solvency Capital Return model for a Class C insurer as AII has not written any long-term insurance business.
Minimum Liquidity Ratio
Under the Insurance Act - Bermuda, an insurer engaged in general business, such as AII, is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than 75% of the amount of its relevant liabilities. 
Notification of New or Increased Shareholder Control and Objection to Shareholder Controller
Pursuant to the Insurance Act - Bermuda, any person who becomes a holder of at least 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% of our shares or AII’s shares (a “shareholder controller”) must notify the BMA within 45 days of becoming such a holder. AII must also notify the BMA if any person has become or ceased to be a shareholder controller of AII, within 45 days of becoming aware of the relevant facts. For so long as we have a subsidiary that is an insurer registered under the Insurance Act - Bermuda, the BMA may at any time object to a person becoming a new shareholder controller or being a holder of 10% or more of our shares if the BMA determines that the person is not or is no longer fit and proper to be such a holder. In any such a case, the BMA may require a shareholder to reduce its holding of our shares and direct, among other things, that such shareholder’s voting rights shall not be exercisable. 
United Kingdom
AmTrust Europe Ltd. ("AEL"), AMT Mortgage Insurance Limited ("AMIL") and Motors Insurance Company Limited ("MIC") are non-life insurance companies organized under the laws of the United Kingdom (including the Companies Act 2006 and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ("FSMA")). As insurance companies, AEL, AMIL and MIC are “dual regulated” by both the Prudential Regulation Authority ("PRA"), a subsidiary of the Bank of England, and the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA"). The stated objective of the United Kingdom government for this dual regulation is to foster a regulatory culture of judgment, expertise and proactive supervision. The FCA takes a more proactive, interventionist approach and has been given a product intervention power that enables it to act quickly to ban or impose restrictions on financial products. The FCA can also make public (through a warning notice), at a much earlier stage in enforcement proceedings, a statement that enables consumers, firms and market users to understand the nature of its concerns that will usually name the company under investigation and, in certain circumstances, name an individual. 
AEL and MIC are both authorized to underwrite various classes of non-life insurance business within the United Kingdom and, for certain of these classes, they are authorized to underwrite risks within some member states of the European Economic Area under the European Council Non-Life Insurance Directives. This is either on a “freedom of services” or on a “freedom of establishment” basis and is subject to complying with such “general good” conditions as may be laid down by the local regulatory authorities. AMIL is a monoline insurer specializing in mortgage insurance and is authorized to underwrite risks within some member states of the European Economic Area under the European Council Non-Life Insurance Directives on both a "freedom of services" and "freedom of establishment" basis.
Change in Control
The FSMA requires controllers of insurers to be approved by the PRA and the FCA. This includes individuals or corporate bodies who wish to take, or increase, control in an authorized insurer. A change in control also occurs when an existing controller decreases control.
A controller is a person or entity who (i) owns or controls 10% or more of the issued share capital or voting power of the authorized insurer, (ii) owns or controls 10% or more of the issued share capital or voting power of a controller of the authorized insurer, or (iii) who otherwise can exercise significant management control of the authorized insurer or one of its controllers. In the case of AEL, this includes (but is not limited to) AmTrust Financial Services, Inc., AII, AII Insurance Management Limited, AII Reinsurance Broker Ltd., AmTrust Equity Solutions, Ltd., AIL, AmTrust North America, Inc. and Barry Zyskind, Leah Karfunkel and George Karfunkel. In the case of MIC, it also includes the aforementioned and Car Care Plan (Holdings) Limited.

Financial Requirements and Regulatory Guidelines
AEL, AMIL and MIC are required to maintain regulatory capital resources in accordance with the Solvency Capital Requirement ("SCR") determined under Solvency II. The SCR is the amount of funds that an insurance firm is required to hold in the European Union, which covers existing business as well as new business expected over the course of 12 months. The SCR can be calculated under either the Standard Formula approach or by using an Internal Model, which requires PRA approval. As of December 31, 2016, AEL, AMIL and MIC each use the Standard Formula approach to calculate their respective SCR and each have maintained capital resources in excess of their respective required SCR.
Restrictions on Dividends
AEL, AMIL and MIC may only make distributions out of profits available for distribution and only with the PRA’s prior consent. Profits available for distribution are the accumulated, realized profits of an insurer so far as not previously distributed or capitalized, less the insurer's accumulated, realized losses so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital. The test of whether the distribution is legal is applied by reference to relevant accounts complying with specified requirements.
Lloyd's
We participate in the Lloyd’s market through our ownership of AmTrust at Lloyd’s Limited, a managing agent for syndicates 1206, 44 and 2526, and AmTrust Lloyd’s Holdings (UK) Limited, a managing agent for syndicates 1861, 5820 and 779 (collectively, the "Lloyd’s managing agents"). The Lloyd’s managing agents are dual-regulated by the FCA and PRA. The Society of Lloyd’s, the FCA and the PRA have statutory responsibilities, including under the Lloyd’s Acts 1871 - 1982 and FSMA, in relation to the supervision of insurance business underwritten in the Lloyd’s markets and the supervision of managing agents operating in the market at Lloyd’s. 
The FCA, the PRA and Lloyd's have complementary objectives in ensuring that the Lloyd's market is appropriately regulated. To minimize duplication, there are arrangements between them for co-operation on supervision and enforcement.
Our Lloyd’s operations are also governed by The Council of Lloyd’s, which, through the Lloyd’s Franchise Board, is responsible for regulating and directing the business of insurance at Lloyd’s in line with its statutory powers, subject to its bylaws and in furtherance of the objects of Lloyd’s. Lloyd’s prescribes, in respect of its managing agents and corporate members, certain minimum standards relating to their management and control, solvency and various other requirements. By entering into a membership agreement with Lloyd’s, our Lloyd’s managing agents undertook to comply with Lloyd’s bylaws and regulations as well as the provisions of the Lloyd’s Acts and the Financial Services and Markets Act that are applicable to them. The operation of syndicates 1206, 44, 2526, 1861, 5820 and 779, as well as the Lloyd’s managing agents and their directors, is subject to the Lloyd’s supervisory regime.
Members of Lloyd’s must support their underwriting capacity by providing a deposit (referred to as “Funds at Lloyd’s” or “FAL”) in the form of cash, securities or letters of credit in an amount determined by Lloyd’s equal to a specified percentage of the member’s underwriting capacity. Each member calculates the amount of such deposit through the completion of an annual capital adequacy exercise and submits the results of this exercise to Lloyd’s for approval. Lloyd’s then advises the member of the amount of deposit that is required. When a managing agent of a syndicate proposes to increase underwriting capacity for the following underwriting year, the consent of the Council of Lloyd’s may be required.
The Council of Lloyd’s has wide discretionary powers to regulate members’ underwriting at Lloyd’s. It may, for instance, change the basis on which syndicate expenses are allocated or vary the FAL ratio or the investment criteria applicable to the provision of FAL. Exercising any of these powers might affect the return on an investment of the corporate member in a given underwriting year. Further, the annual business plans of a syndicate are subject to the review and approval of the Lloyd’s Franchise Board, which is responsible for setting risk management and profitability targets for the Lloyd’s market and operates a business planning and monitoring process for all syndicates.
If a member of Lloyd’s is unable to pay its debts to policyholders, such debts may be payable by the Lloyd’s Central Fund, which acts similarly to state guaranty funds in the United States. If Lloyd’s determines that the Central Fund needs to be increased, it has the power to assess premium levies on current Lloyd’s members. The Council of Lloyd’s has discretion to call or assess up to 3% of a member’s underwriting capacity in any one year as a Central Fund contribution.

Solvency II
The European Union’s executive body, the European Commission, implemented a new capital adequacy and risk management regulation called “Solvency II” that applies to our businesses across the European Union (including the United Kingdom) and impacts AEL, AMIL, MIC, our Lloyd's syndicates, AIU and our Luxembourg entities. Solvency II became effective on January 1, 2016 and imposes new requirements with respect to capital structure, technical provisions, solvency calculations, governance, disclosure and risk management, and we have undertaken considerable preparatory work to ensure that the impacted businesses were compliant upon implementation. In addition, under Solvency II, it is possible that the U.S. parent of a European Union subsidiary could be subject to certain Solvency II requirements if the regulator determines that the subsidiary’s capital position is dependent on the parent company and the U.S. parent is not already subject to regulations deemed “equivalent” to Solvency II. Such regulation could apply to us as the U.S. parent of a European Union subsidiary and could result in a need for additional capital, increased costs of compliance, increased disclosure and less flexibility in our capital management.
