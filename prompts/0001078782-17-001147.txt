Corporate Background
 
We were incorporated on January 9, 2014 under the laws of the state of Nevada. We have predominately been involved in administrative activities such as marketing, establishing relationships with service providers and establishing our office facilities. 
    We are a company previously in the business of selling and providing services for GPS Tracking Devices. Our previous product, called the AnyTrack GPS was a next generation remote personal locator device used to primarily located and aid in the timely rescue of missing children, the elderly and pets. In addition, our devices were to have additional functionalities, such as keeping track of heart rates, with data being sent remotely and in the future we will add additional functionalities such as keeping track of blood alcohol content, which would be useful for parolees or anyone that has been convicted of a DUI. In addition to selling these devices, we planned to offer monthly services, such as tracking and data collection at a monthly fee. We planned to market our devices to the U.S., Canada and Europe and then extending to Asia. 
    On June 20, 2014, we entered into a supply agreement with Shenzhen Coban Electronics Co., Ltd. for the supply of the GPS tracking devices we plan on marketing as AnyTrack GPS. This is a non-exclusive distribution agreement for the territories of North America, Jamaica, Dominican Republic and Europe. We were required to purchase a total of 100 devices as an initial order and an additional 100 devices in the first year of the agreement in order for the agreement to be extended. The devices carry a manufacturer’s warranty of one year. Our company has purchased 100 devices for its initial order for a total of $3,026. Initially, we planned to re-sell these devices to the public under our AnyTrack brand name. As of January 31, 2017, we have not sold any of these devices yet. We planned on developing proprietary products such as wristbands, watches, or dog collars which will incorporate these devices.

The Company intends to undertake a new business plan in the near future.
 
We intend to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months through a combination of debt financing and equity financing by way of private placements. We currently do not have any arrangements or commitments in place to complete any private placement financings in an amount sufficient to further our business plan and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any such financings on terms that will be acceptable to us. We are actively seeking additional funding, but have not closed any such funding as of this date. 
    If we are not able to raise $975,000, that we require to implement our new business plan as anticipated, we will scale our business development in line with available capital. Our primary priority will be to retain our reporting status with the SEC which means that we will first ensure that we have sufficient capital to cover our corporate, legal and accounting expenses. We will likely not expend funds on the remainder of our planned activities unless we have the required capital.
