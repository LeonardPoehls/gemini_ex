Overview 
 Quotient Technology Inc., is a provider of an industry leading digital marketing platform that drives sales by delivering personalized and targeted coupons and ads to shoppers at the right moment on their path to purchase. We’ve built a scaled network of consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) brands, retailers and shoppers, all digitally connected through our core platform, called Retailer iQ. Using proprietary and licensed data, including online behaviors, purchase intent, and retailers’ in-store point-of-sale (“POS”) shopper data, we target shoppers with the most relevant digital coupons and ads, as well as measure campaign performance, including attribution of dollars spent on digital marketing to in-store sales. Customers and partners use our digital platform as a more effective channel to influence shoppers. 
 We operate our platform across a broad distribution network, reaching over approximately 60 million shoppers at critical moments in their path to purchase. Our network includes the app and website of our flagship consumer brand, Coupons.com, our other owned and operated properties, and thousands of our publisher partners. In addition, we operate Retailer iQ on a co-branded or white label basis with our retail partners, providing them a digital platform to directly engage with their shoppers across their websites, mobile, ecommerce, and social channels.
 Our network is made up of three constituencies: 
  
• | Our clients consist of approximately 700 CPGs, representing approximately 2,000 brands, including many of the leading food, beverage, personal and household product manufacturers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our retail partners, representing multiple classes of trade such as leading grocery retailers; drug, dollar, club, and mass merchandise channels, where the majority of CPG products are sold; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Millions of consumers visiting our web, mobile properties, and social channels, as well as those of our CPGs, retailers, and publishing partners.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our platform, serving these three groups, has created a network effect, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage over both offline and online competitors. As our shopper audience increases, our platform becomes more valuable to CPGs and retailers, which, in turn, rely more heavily on our platform for their digital promotions and media. In addition, the breadth of coupon and advertising content offered from leading brands enables us to attract and retain more retailers and shoppers. As our network expands, we generate more shopper data and insights, which improve our ability to deliver more relevant and personalized promotions and media.
 We primarily generate revenue by providing digital coupons and media solutions to our customers and partners. 
 3

We generate revenue from promotions, in which CPGs pay us to deliver coupons to consumers through our network of publishers and retail partners. Each time a consumer activates a digital coupon on our platform or in some cases redeems a digital coupon, we are generally paid a fee. Activation of a digital coupon can include: saving it to a retailer loyalty account or printing it for physical redemption at a retailer.
We generally pay a distribution fee to retailers or publishers when a shopper activates a digital promotion on their website or mobile app. These distribution fees are included in our cost of revenues. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – “Non-GAAP Financial Measure and Key Operating Metrics” for more information.
 Promotion revenues also include our Specialty Retail business, in which specialty stores including clothing, electronics, home improvement and many others offer coupon codes that we distribute. Each time a consumer makes a purchase using a coupon code, a transaction occurs and a distribution fee is generally paid. 
 We also generate revenues from digital advertising. CPGs, advertising agencies, and retailers who use our platform to deliver digital advertising. Using data on our Quotient Media Exchange (QMX) platform, we target audiences with digital ad campaigns. These ads are delivered to shoppers through our network, including our websites and mobile apps, as well as those of our publishers, retailers and other third parties. Campaigns can then be measured based on performance, attributing digital ad campaigns to in-store purchases in near real time. In May 2017, we closed our acquisition of Crisp Mobile, which enhanced our mobile advertising and analytics capabilities, as well as accelerated our growth in media. We generally pay a distribution fee to retailers for use of data for targeting or measurement, or to publishers to deliver campaigns on certain publishing networks or sites. These distribution fees are included in our cost of revenues. 
 During 2017, we generated revenues of $322.1 million, representing 17% growth over 2016, and a net loss of $15.1 million as compared to $19.5 million in 2016. See our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes for more information. For the year ended December 31, 2017, there was no revenue from a customer that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, total revenue from The Procter and Gamble Company accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. 
 Our Industry
 Retailers and CPGs are turning to data-driven digital marketing strategies to engage and influence shoppers to compete more effectively in today’s retail environment and drive sales. By shifting dollars from traditional offline channels to digital, brands and retailers can use shopper data and behaviors to target and deliver digital coupons and advertising with greater efficiency and return on investment. 
 For decades, retailers and CPGs have worked together to drive sales, which in turn benefits both parties. CPGs sell their products to retailers, and retailers are responsible for selling those products directly to shoppers. To help retailers attract shoppers and ensure sales, CPGs spend over $225 billion annually in promotions, media, shopper marketing, trade and other in-store advertising. Historically, the vast majority of these dollars have been spent in offline channels such as free-standing inserts found in Sunday newspapers, direct mail, printed circulars, in-store aisle tags, end caps and TV. These traditional offline channels are becoming less effective as consumers spend more time online, particularly on mobile, giving way to the rising importance of using data to drive personalized and targeted, content to shoppers. To reach shoppers at the right time and place, CPGs and retailers are shifting dollars historically spent in offline channels to digital.
 Digital coupons, primarily funded by CPGs, have been found to be more effective and are redeemed at higher rates compared to traditional offline promotions. According to an annual industry report by NCH Marketing Services, Inc., in 2016, digital coupons (including digital print and digital paperless coupons) represented less than 1% of total U.S. CPG coupon distribution volume, but accounted for almost 12% of total U.S. CPG coupon redemptions. We believe that the ease of digital promotions, coupled with greater awareness of digital savings programs, is broadening the demographic reach and driving demand for digital promotions. 
 Trade promotions, defined as special promotions offered to drive additional sales directly from a particular retailer, are also funded by CPGs. Historically, trade promotions have been mass marketed through retailers in offline vehicles such as aisle tags and printed circulars. We believe CPGs will shift offline trade promotions to digital as retailers continue to increase their digital marketing activities and better use their shopper data.

Advertising from shopper marketing, defined as advertising funded by the CPG to gain shopper awareness and drive sales within a specific retailer, is also shifting from traditional in-store and print advertising to digital, particularly to mobile. According to the Association of National Advertisers, shopper marketing budgets are expected to grow to a nearly $19.0 billion market in the next few years as shopper marketers look to reach shoppers across the right touchpoints at the right time. Additionally, portions of CPG brand advertising, which has historically been spent in traditional offline channels such as print and TV, is also expected to shift to digital channels. eMarketer projects that by 2020, CPG and the consumer products industry digital ad spending will be approximately $9.5 billion, an increase from the approximately $6 billion spent in 2016.
 As the shift to digital coupon and digital advertising continues to grow, so does the importance placed on data to target audiences and provide campaign performance measurements. Over 90% of grocery sales occur in-store with shopper data residing offline, creating a particular need to attribute dollars spent in digital coupons and advertising directly to in-store sales. 
 Our Solutions 
 We offer an industry leading digital platform that enables CPG brands and retailers to drive sales and engage shoppers through personalized and targeted promotions and media. Approximately 700 CPGs, representing approximately 2,000 brands, use our platform to manage and distribute digital coupons and advertising, target shopper audiences, and measure campaign performance.  
 Through Quotient’s solutions, brands and retailers can manage their national brand promotions, trade promotions, shopper marketing, and brand media advertising together, combining shopper insights and purchase data with broad distribution capabilities across mobile, web, and social channels. We also enable brands and retailers to develop marketing and promotional programs within days, with the added flexibility of adjusting programs in real time. This differs from the long lead times typically required in traditional offline marketing vehicles. Our platform delivers value as a stand- alone promotions or media offering, but also provides additional value when used collectively. 
 We have a broad distribution network that includes our owned and operated web and mobile properties, such as Coupons.com, and thousands of publishing and retailer partner sites. Coupons can be saved directly to a retailer loyalty card and redeemed at checkout, redeemed for cash back through our mobile receipt scanning feature, or printed and taken directly to the store for physical redemption. 
 Retailer iQ is used at top retailers in the grocery, drug, dollar and mass merchandise channels and is a co-branded or white-labeled solution that powers retailer websites, ecommerce experiences, mobile websites and mobile applications. Retailer iQ integrates into retailers’ points-of-sale (POS) and serves as their digital marketing platform, creating a direct, digital relationship with millions of their consumers. Through Retailer iQ retailers and CPGs distribute personalized and targeted coupons and media to help drive shopper loyalty and increased sales. Additional Retailer iQ features include digital grocery list, digital receipt, digital circular and beacon technology. 
 Our solution also provides CPGs and retailers with closed-loop attribution through campaign performance measurement. With Retailer iQ, brands can tie digital coupons and advertising campaigns directly to in-store sales. Our campaign measurement tools also provide brands and retailers with flexibility to adjust their campaigns in mid-flight to drive greater efficiency with marketing dollars. 
 Quotient Promotions
 We offer digital paperless and digital print promotions through our Quotient Promotions Network (formerly known as our Digital Free-Standing Insert Network). With digital paperless, shoppers save coupons directly to retailer loyalty accounts for automatic digital redemption, or by redeeming coupons using a mobile device for cash back after taking a picture of a retailer receipt with the appropriate purchase. With digital print, shoppers select coupons and print them from their desktop or mobile device to redeem in store.

Through our platform, CPGs and retailers can reach shoppers on the web and on mobile devices by offering digital coupons through our extensive network which includes:
  
• | the Coupons.com website and our Coupons.com and Shopmium mobile application platforms;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CPG and retailer websites and mobile applications, either hosted by us or hosted by them using our APIs; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the websites and mobile applications of thousands of registered partner sites included in our publisher network.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have designed and engineered our platform to support personalization, targeting and optimization in the delivery of digital coupons. We start with demographic and geography based personalization techniques to ensure that consumers see and can easily access the most relevant content. We personalize content based on offers the consumer has clicked on and searches the consumer may have conducted on our network as well as the coupons that the consumer previously activated, and redeemed. We also offer targeted promotions based on the criteria listed above, combined with data from our Retailer iQ integrations with select retailers. We offer a receipt-scanning, cash-back mobile coupon for direct cash back after taking a picture of a retailer receipt with the appropriate purchase.
 Retailer iQ allows retailers to integrate our digital promotions with their loyalty programs and POS systems for digital paperless delivery. Retailer iQ provides a personalized consumer experience to help retailers and brands drive loyalty and engagement with their shoppers. By integrating with the retailer POS system, our solution leverages data available across various touchpoints including web, mobile and customer channels such as email, social and POS purchase data. Using data, the platform allows for real-time recommendations of digital coupons and products, targeted media, real-time reporting, targeting and analytics, and digital receipts, all of which help retailers and brands communicate with and influence their shoppers, primarily through their mobile phones.
 Our solutions are designed for mobile channels, a key consumer touchpoint, to further drive consumer adoption and engagement across our platform. Retailer iQ, for instance, powers retailer mobile applications and websites to enable consumers to download coupons, create shopping lists, and search for offers while on the go. CPGs can target Retailer iQ shoppers to personalize brand engagement or provide brand information. Our Coupons.com mobile application allows consumers to access our digital coupons and coupon codes, and is designed to provide personalized and location-based content. Shopmium, our mobile application in France and U.K, allows consumers to use a CPG coupon by taking a picture of a receipt and uploading it to Quotient, where we validate the purchase against the coupon, and make payment to the consumer directly to a bank or PayPal account.
 Quotient Media  
 We offer targeted advertising solutions through Quotient Media Exchange (QMX), enabling brands and retailers to reach shoppers before, during and after their shopping cycles with digital media campaigns. Through QMX, advertisers can leverage Quotient’s audience reach and exclusive data to deliver targeted media across our network, including Retailer iQ and Coupons.com website and app, and across web, mobile and social channels outside our network. For example, we can target consumers on Facebook who have redeemed a coupon or purchased a product in a particular product category with media advertising within that product category.
 In 2017, we enhanced our mobile media and campaign measurement solutions with the acquisition of Crisp Media. Crisp’s expertise around creative services, dynamic targeting, mobile delivery and performance management complemented our QMX solution.  
 We also provide CPGs, retailers and other advertisers access to our Coupons.com audience, including our website and mobile properties, to highlight their brands including premier media and advertising placements on our site, promoted positions within our coupon galleries and premium placement in our marketing efforts.
 The quality and real-time nature of our data network enables us to offer relevant and targeted media with campaign performance measurement. Through our Quotient Insights Platform, we combine purchase data from select retailers across the Quotient Retailer iQ network with online engagement and purchase-intent data from Quotient’s flagship brand, Coupons.com, and the Company’s thousands of publishing partners. This enables advertisers to reach a broad national audience or a single retailer’s customers using our solution. Our data processing systems also allow us to extend our reach, providing consumer intent signals to various advertising networks. Using the Insights Platform, we’re able to measure campaign performance, attributing digital media to in-store purchases and helping brands and retailers generate profitable sales. As our platform, network and audience expands, the value of our data and analytics increases.

Publishing Channels
 Our platform includes numerous tools to enhance the effectiveness of promotions, media and analytics, and drive increased monetization through our platform. These tools are used by us, as well as our CPG, retailer and publisher partners.
 Brandcaster®.  Our Brandcaster technology powers our affiliate program by enabling third-party publishers to easily display our promotions and media to visitors on their sites. Brandcaster’s easy-to-use self-service platform allows publishers to produce a look and feel customized to their brand and earn revenue for the coupons that are activated on their site and for media impressions.
 Emails.    We deliver personalized emails with coupon offers and digital circular offers to shoppers based on their purchase behavior and intent, or interaction with our site. Shoppers who receive emails with personalized promotional content include registered users on our Coupons.com site and those of our Retailer iQ retailers.
 Social.    We enable CPGs to distribute coupons on their Facebook pages in a seamless and fully customizable solution through an API on our platform. They then can manage the look and feel of the experience for consumers. Typically, CPGs will use coupons as an incentive for consumers to “like” their Facebook pages and brands and our application handles the process and tracking.
 Bricks.    Our Bricks services include coupons and mobile cash rebate offers that operate just like the digital offers that we distribute on Coupons.com and across the Quotient Promotions Network, but the CPG is responsible for setting up and driving distribution. For example, our Bricks service may enable a CPG to make available a specific coupon on their website. CPGs can leverage our technology to facilitate the printing, digital receipt scan and rebate, and tracking of offers in a secure manner, but the CPG distributes the coupon through its own distribution process such as an email campaign or as part of a special promotion on their site.
 Media Units.    We deliver personalized and targeted coupon offers and digital circular offers to shoppers, via media ad units, based on their purchase behavior and intent, or interaction with our site. Shoppers will see media ad units on the Coupons.com site as well as our retailer partner’s sites and other sites that are part of our publishing network. Shoppers who receive media ads with personalized promotional content include registered users on our Coupons.com site and those of our Retailer iQ retailers.
Growth Strategy 
 We intend to grow our platform and our business through the following key strategies:
 Increase revenues from CPGs already on our platform.    Based on our experience to date, we believe we have opportunities to continue increasing revenues from our existing CPG customer base through:
  
• | increasing our share of CPG spending on overall coupons and trade promotions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increasing the number of brands that are using our platform within each CPG;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increasing media spending on our platform and our network;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | leveraging our data to provide more targeted promotions, media, and analytics; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maximizing consumer’s experiences across all products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 Expand our network through Retailer iQ, our digital paperless platform.    By using our platform to aggregate and optimize data, CPGs and retailers are able to offer personalized and targeted consumer experiences to more effectively engage consumers and drive sales. By bringing retailers and shoppers onto Retailer iQ, we are able to grow our digital paperless offering and distribution reach, and further leverage consumer insights from the platform. We believe as we continue to expand our network through Retailer iQ and increased shopper adoption, the value we provide to CPGs and retailers increases, as well as the opportunity to increase our share of CPG spending from promotions, trade spend and media budgets. We intend to continue to invest in technologies and product offerings that further integrate digital promotions and media into the retailer channel, and specifically within our Retailer iQ platform.

Grow our current customer base and add new industry segments.    We believe we have the opportunity to grow the number of brands and retailers that we serve, thereby increasing the value of our platform to all constituents. In addition, we intend to continue growing our business with other manufacturers and retailers in new industry segments such as convenience and specialty/franchise retail, restaurants and entertainment venues.
 Grow shopper adoption and engagement of our digital offerings.    We plan to continue to innovate and invest across our platform, including Retailer iQ, mobile solutions, media and digital promotion offerings, Coupons.com mobile app, our publishing network, and analytics. We plan to continue helping our Retailer iQ partners launch and market the platform in order to generate and increase shopper adoption and engagement of digital paperless promotions. We believe that CPG spending on digital promotions and marketing will continue to grow as point of sale, mobile channels and social media offer new opportunities to engage consumers on their path to purchase. 
 Grow our media business.     We plan to grow our media business, including QMX, by continuing to invest in our media solutions, including enhancements to our targeting and reporting capabilities and expanded use of our proprietary data as well as data from select exclusive retailer partnerships. We also plan to scale our network through new publishers, expanded partnerships, new verticals, and third parties such as media agencies.
 Expand and grow Quotient Insights, and our emerging products around data and analytics.   As our network, content pool and shopper audience expands, resulting in greater data and insights, we believe that our platform will become more valuable. We expect to introduce new, more robust, solutions to our customers around campaign performance, analytics and insights. Our targeted promotion offering, QMX and our campaign performance measurement products, are just three examples of how we use the platform to drive more value across the network. We also have the growing capability to directly link digital campaigns and media to in-store purchase data. We believe we are in a unique position to deliver new products around data and analytics, and the opportunity to grow Quotient Insights increases as we continue to expand.
 Grow international operations.    Many CPGs and retailers on our platform have global operations and we believe that we can opportunistically grow our operations and offerings in existing international markets and partner with our existing clients to enter new geographies in which they operate. We also plan to leverage our existing presence in France through our mobile application Shopmium, a receipt-scanning, cash-back mobile application platform, to broaden our international opportunity beginning with the United Kingdom.
 Selectively pursue strategic acquisitions.   We intend to continue pursuing selective acquisition and partnership opportunities that we believe can expand our business.
 Security 
 Our platform includes a proprietary digital distribution management system to enable CPGs and retailers to securely control the number of coupons distributed by device. We have controls in place to limit the number of digital coupons that can be printed. Similar controls are in place for linking coupons to loyalty cards and other paperless solutions, which allows us to limit the number of coupons distributed and activated. In addition, each printed coupon carries a unique ID that is encrypted, enabling us to trace each coupon from print to redemption. All of our digital print coupons can be authenticated and validated using this unique code. This unique ID also can be used to detect counterfeit or altered coupons. Our platform allows us to systematically identify and respond to fraudulent and prohibited activities by restricting a device from printing coupons.Sales and Marketing 
 We have a team of dedicated, skilled specialists focused on CPGs and retailers. We believe that our sales, integration, promotions and media campaign management and analytics, and customer support capabilities are difficult to replicate and a key reason for the growth of our business. Much of our sales activity is focused on expanding the number of brands within our existing CPG customers that offer digital promotions and media through our platform as well as expanding the volume of offers made by the brands currently using our platform. The team is also focused on expanding relationships within CPGs to include shopper marketing teams, where we believe there is a large opportunity for growth particularly in media. Additionally, we are focused on continuing to increase the size and breadth of our publisher network. We are also seeking to partner with CPGs and other manufacturers and retailers in new industry segments such as convenience and specialty/franchise retail, restaurants and entertainment venues.
 In addition to sales support during the campaign planning process, our sales representatives provide additional support to CPGs and retailers to ensure that their campaigns are launched and delivered within specified timeframes. Representatives assigned to specific customers review performance metrics and share feedback with the advertiser.

We are focused on managing our brand, increasing market awareness and generating new advertiser leads. In doing so, we often present at industry conferences, create custom events and invest in public relations. In addition, our marketing team advertises online, in print and in other forms of media, creates case studies, sponsors research, publishes marketing collateral and undertakes customer research studies.
 Technology and Infrastructure 
 Since inception, we have made significant investments and will continue to invest in developing our differentiated and proprietary platforms aimed at solving the problems of CPGs and retailers in ways that traditional solutions cannot. We are focused on offering solutions that provide measurable results. We have assembled a team of highly skilled engineers and computer scientists with deep expertise across a broad range of relevant disciplines. Key focus areas of our engineering team include: 
  
• | Scalable infrastructure. We use a combination of proprietary and open-source software to achieve a horizontally scalable, global, distributed and fault-tolerant architecture, with the goal of enabling us to ensure the continuity of our business, regardless of local disruptions. Our computational infrastructure currently processes millions of events per day and is designed in a way that enables us to add significant capacity to our platform as we scale our business without requiring any material design or architecture modifications. Our private cloud technology infrastructure is hosted across data centers in co-location facilities in California, Nevada, and Virginia. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Redundancy. Our production infrastructure utilizes a hot failover configuration which allows us to switch server loads, be it a single server or an entire data center, to the other data center within minutes. Data is continuously replicated between sites, and multiple copies at each site provide fast recovery whenever it is requested. Each data center has been designed to handle more than our entire server needs, which enables us to perform platform maintenance, business resumption and disaster recovery without any customer impact. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reporting. Our user interface provides flexible reporting and interactive visualization of the key drivers of success for each media campaign. We use these reporting and visualization products internally to manage campaigns and provide advertisers with campaign insights. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Security. Our security policy adheres to established policies to ensure that all data, code, and production infrastructure are secure and protected. Our data centers are SSAE 16 Type II certified and we are PCI DSS compliant where required. We use our internal team and third parties to test, audit, and review our entire production environment to protect it. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our research and development expenses were $50.0 million, $50.5 million and $48.4 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We capitalized internal-use software development costs of $3.8 million, $0.7 million and $1.5 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Competition 
 We compete against a variety of different businesses with respect to different aspects of our business, including: 
  
• | traditional offline coupon and discount services, as well as newspapers, magazines and other traditional media companies that provide coupon promotions and discounts on products and services in free standing inserts or other forms, including Valassis Communications, Inc., News America Marketing Interactive, Inc. and Catalina Marketing Corporation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | providers of digital coupons such as Valassis’ Redplum.com, Catalina Marketing Corporation’s Cellfire, Inmar, News America Marketing’s SmartSource, YouTech, and companies that offer coupon codes such as RetailMeNot, Inc., Groupon Inc., Exponential Interactive Inc.’s TechBargains, Savings.com, Inc. and Ebates Performance Marketing, Inc., companies that offer cash back solutions such as iBotta, Inc., News America Marketing’s Checkout 51, and companies providing other e-commerce based services that allow consumers to obtain direct or indirect discounts on purchases;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | internet sites that are focused on specific communities or interests that offer coupons or discount arrangements related to such communities or interests;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | companies offering online and marketing services to retailers and CPGs, such as MyWebGrocer, Inc. and Flipp Corporation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 9

 
• | companies offering media services, such as Triad Media Inc. and RichRelevance, Inc.; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | retailers marketing and offering their own digital coupons directly to consumers using their own websites, email newsletters and alerts, mobile applications and social media channels.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the principal factors that generally determine a company’s competitive advantage in our market include the following: 
  
• | scale and effectiveness of reach in connecting CPGs and retailers to consumers in a digital manner, through web, mobile and other online properties;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to attract consumers to use digital coupons;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | platform security, scalability, reliability and availability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | our proprietary intent data and access to POS data from select retailer partners;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | number of channels by which a company engages with consumers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | integration of products and solutions;
--+---------------------------------------


• | rapid deployment of products and services for customers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | breadth, quality and relevance of the Company’s digital coupons, media and measurement;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to deliver digital coupons that are widely available and easy to use in consumers’ preferred form;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | integration with retailer applications;
--+----------------------------------------


• | brand recognition;
--+-------------------


• | quality of tools, reporting and analytics for planning, development, optimization and measurement of promotions and media; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | breadth and expertise of the Company’s sales organization.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 While we believe we compete effectively with respect to the factors identified above, we may face increasing competition from larger or more established companies that seek to enter our market or from smaller companies that launch new products, solutions and services that could gain market acceptance.
 Culture and Employees 
 We are proud of our company culture and consider it to be one of our competitive strengths. Our culture helps drive our business and compete for talented employees in a highly competitive market. We seek to offer an environment that allows our employees to thrive and grow. 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 727 full-time employees, consisting of 543 employees in the United States and 184 employees internationally.
Intellectual Property 
 We protect our intellectual property by relying on federal, state, and common law rights in the United States and equivalent rights in other jurisdictions, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology and algorithms by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties.
 In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names to protect our intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. As of December 31, 2017, we hold or have exclusive rights to 27 active issued patents in the United States and 10 active patents that have been issued outside of the United States with terms expiring between 2019 and 2032. 
 10

Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective or may require significant expenditures and other resources to enforce. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could harm our business and our operating results, or ability to compete.
 Companies in Internet-related and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We currently are, have been subject to in the past, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement.
