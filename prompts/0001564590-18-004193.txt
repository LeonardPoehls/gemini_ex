Overview
 We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing, and commercializing therapeutics to address serious and life-threatening diseases with few or no approved therapies by targeting molecular pathways that regulate cellular metabolism and inflammation.  We are currently conducting three registrational trials with our lead product candidates, bardoxolone methyl and omaveloxolone, which activate the transcription factor Nrf2 to restore mitochondrial function, reduce oxidative stress, and resolve inflammation.  Our lead registrational programs are evaluating our product candidates for the treatment of a rare form of chronic kidney disease (CKD) caused by Alport syndrome, a rare form of degenerative neuromuscular disease called Friedreich’s ataxia (FA), and a rare and severe form of pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue disease (CTD-PAH).
 We are developing bardoxolone methyl for the treatment of patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome and four additional rare forms of CKD that, in the aggregate, affect more than half a million patients in the United States.  CKD is characterized by a progressive worsening in the rate at which the kidney filters waste products from the blood, called the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  When GFR gets too low, patients develop end stage renal disease (ESRD) and require dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive.  In 11 clinical trials, bardoxolone methyl has been shown to consistently improve kidney function, as assessed by estimated GFR (eGFR) in patients with a variety of diseases that result in decreased kidney function.  We believe that bardoxolone methyl treatment has the potential to delay or prevent GFR declines that cause the need for dialysis or a transplant in patients with Alport syndrome and other rare forms of CKD.  
 We are conducting a Phase 2/3 trial called CARDINAL, which is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in the Phase 3 portion, that studies the safety and efficacy of bardoxolone methyl in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome.  Alport syndrome is a rare and serious hereditary disease with no approved therapies that affects both children and adults.  Patients with Alport syndrome experience annual declines in kidney function and, in patients with the most severe forms of the disease, approximately 50% progress to dialysis by age of 25, 90% by age 40, and nearly 100% by age 60.  Last year, we reported the primary endpoint data for the open label, Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL.  In the Phase 2 portion, bardoxolone methyl demonstrated a statistically significant, mean increase from baseline in eGFR in 30 patients after 12 weeks of treatment.  All patients had an increase in eGFR, and these increases in eGFR translated to an improvement in CKD stage for approximately 73% of patients.  
 Based on these results, we began enrolling the Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL last year.  The Phase 3 study will enroll approximately 150 patients randomized evenly to either bardoxolone methyl or placebo.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided us with guidance that, in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome, an analysis of retained eGFR, which is the eGFR change after a four week withdrawal of drug, demonstrating an improvement versus placebo after one year of bardoxolone methyl treatment may support accelerated approval. In addition, data demonstrating an improvement versus placebo in retained eGFR after two years of treatment may support full approval.  We expect to have one year top-line results from the Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL available in the second half of 2019.  If successful, we believe the results from the Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL, together with other data from our development program, will be sufficient to form the basis of a New Drug Application (NDA) submission to the FDA seeking approval of bardoxolone methyl for the treatment of CKD caused by Alport syndrome.
 We are developing omaveloxolone for the treatment of patients with FA, an inherited, debilitating, and degenerative neuromuscular disorder, caused by mutations in the gene for frataxin, a mitochondrial protein.  Patients with FA are typically dependent on wheelchair use 10 to 15 years after disease onset, and their median age of death is in the mid-30s.  There are no currently approved therapies for the treatment of FA.  Omaveloxolone is being studied in the registrational part 2 of our MOXIe trial.  In part 1 of MOXIe, at the optimal dose level, omaveloxolone demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in modified Friedreich’s Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS) scores of 3.8 points (p=0.0001) versus baseline and a placebo-corrected improvement in mFARS scores of 2.3 points (p=0.06).  We expect to have top-line data from the MOXIe trial in the second half of 2019.  If successful, we believe the results from the MOXIe clinical trial, together with other data from the omaveloxolone program, will be sufficient to form the basis of an NDA submission to the FDA seeking approval of omaveloxolone for the treatment of FA.
 We are studying bardoxolone methyl in CTD-PAH, which is a serious and progressive disease that leads to heart failure and death.  CTD-PAH patients are less responsive to existing vasodilator therapies than patients with the idiopathic form of PAH (I-PAH) and have a worse prognosis.  Bardoxolone methyl is being studied for the treatment of CTD-PAH in the Phase 3 CATALYST trial.  We initiated CATALYST following review of initial data from our Phase 2 clinical trial, LARIAT, which demonstrated a statistically significant, mean time-averaged increase in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) at 16 weeks in CTD-PAH patients compared to baseline.  We currently expect to have top-line data from the CATALYST trial in the second half of 2018.  However, the trial is designed to enroll between 130 and 200 patients, and the final sample size will be determined by a pre-specified, blinded sample size re-calculation based on 6MWD variability and baseline characteristics.  The timing of data availability may change if the sample size is increased due to the sample size re-calculation.  If successful, we believe the results from the CATALYST trial, together with other data from the bardoxolone methyl development program, will be sufficient to form the basis of an NDA submission to the FDA seeking approval of bardoxolone methyl for the treatment of CTD-PAH.

In addition to our three registrational programs, we are currently conducting a battery of additional clinical and preclinical programs in serious and life-threatening diseases that may provide expansion opportunities for our drug candidates.  We plan to evaluate data from these earlier stage programs to determine which indications to advance into later stage trials.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to become a leader in the discovery, development, and commercialization of small molecule therapies for the treatment of severe and life-threatening diseases.  We seek to identify and select, for development and commercialization, small molecules with novel mechanisms of action that we believe have biological properties with broad applicability.  Once we have selected a class of small molecules, we apply their biological properties to clinical settings with unmet needs, and we triage opportunities based on development timeline and cost, regulatory pathway, and commercial opportunity.  After identifying suitable molecules for clinical development, we mitigate development risk by maintaining a diversified and broad clinical pipeline, rapidly analyzing data to determine the potential of each program, and entering into development collaborations with industry-leading collaborators.  Our strategy includes the following key components:

• | Completing our ongoing registrational trials and seeking regulatory approval. We are currently studying bardoxolone methyl in registrational clinical trials in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome and in patients with CTD-PAH, and omaveloxolone in a registrational trial in patients with FA. We plan to complete these trials and, if successful, to seek regulatory approval for commercialization in all three indications. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercializing our product candidates currently in registrational trials in the United States. We retain commercial rights in the United States to our lead product candidates, bardoxolone methyl and omaveloxolone, and intend to commercialize these product candidates, if approved, in the United States. As we advance towards regulatory approvals for our lead product candidates, we intend to establish a specialty sales and marketing infrastructure and to contract with third parties for commercial scale manufacturing. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercializing our product candidates currently in registrational trials outside of the United States. We plan to internationally commercialize our lead product candidates, bardoxolone methyl and omaveloxolone, subject to regulatory approvals, either alone, with our strategic collaborators AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) and Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (KHK), or with new collaboration partners. With the expansion of our product candidate pipeline, we may opportunistically seek additional strategic collaborations to maximize our commercial opportunities for these new product candidates outside of the United States. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuing to advance our Phase 1 and 2 clinical programs into registrational trials. Our goal is to complete our Phase 1 and 2 clinical programs and evaluate data from all of these programs to determine how to prioritize and move forward into additional trials. We plan to review indications in all of the disease spaces in which we are working and select indications for development based on the relevancy of data and regulatory endpoints. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advancing our preclinical programs into clinical development. We intend to advance our preclinical programs, including our RORgT inhibitors, through preclinical studies into clinical development. We believe that the anti-inflammatory effects of RORgT inhibitors may be promising for the treatment of a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leveraging our technologies to expand our development pipeline. We intend to leverage our multiple technologies by exploring preclinical and clinical proof of concept studies with multiple new molecules. We believe that our technologies may enable us to treat indications beyond those that we are currently exploring. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Using our expertise to identify promising novel molecules and technologies. Our management team collectively has over 200 years of experience in small molecule development, and we intend to use this expertise, together with our established drug selection and development methodology, to advance what we believe to be the most promising small molecules that we currently own and to opportunistically in-license additional small molecules for development.

If the final sample size is at the high end of the enrollment target, the timing of data release may change.
 Foundational Biology of Our Nrf2 Activators
 The foundational biology of Nrf2 activation underlies our two lead product candidates, bardoxolone methyl and omaveloxolone.  Nrf2 activators bind to Keap1, a protein that coordinates the cellular response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other stimuli.  Binding to Keap1 activates Nrf2, a transcription factor that evolved to orchestrate the resolution of inflammation.  Nrf2 coordinates this process by normalizing metabolism and increasing mitochondrial energy production (ATP), increasing cellular antioxidant capacity, and reducing production of ROS.  This activity inhibits inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NF-κB and the inflammasome.  

1 | Multiple disease processes or external stimuli can initiate cellular responses leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Specific triggers can include an autoimmune response, genetic mutations, cellular damage (generating damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), infections (generating pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), or cytokine production. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2 | Electrons are carried in the electron transport chain by NADH and FADH2, which are reducing equivalents that transfer electrons for the production of ATP. NADH is the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and FADH2 is the reduced form of flavin adenine dinucleotide. ROS are generated during the production of ATP; an excess of ROS leads to oxidative stress. Reducing equivalents within the cell can either be consumed to produce energy via ATP, or consumed to defend against oxidative stress (ROS). Nrf2 activation is also associated with an increase in the number of mitochondria within cells (mitochondrial biogenesis). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3 | Glutathione, SOD (superoxide dismutase), TRX (thioredoxin), GRX (glutaredoxin), PRX (peroxiredoxins), and GPX (glutathione peroxidase) are all enzymes and molecules with antioxidant activities, which convert ROS, reactive nitrogen species, and other harmful reactive molecules into less harmful molecules. Nrf2 activation leads to increased production of these antioxidants, which augments the ability of the cell to defend against oxidative stress, thereby allowing more reducing equivalents to be used for energy production. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4 | A key component of inflammatory signaling is the NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome. NLRP3 can be activated by a number of stimuli, including mitochondrial ROS. NLRP3 activation, together with IκBα/Nf- κ B signaling, leads to the

production of multiple proteins involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, including IL-1β (interleukin 1-beta), IL-6 (interleukin 6), MCP1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1), and TNF α (tumor necrosis factor-alpha). IκBα is a negative regulator of the Nf- κ B pathway. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Abnormal metabolism, decreased ATP levels, increased ROS production, and chronic inflammatory signaling are common features of a variety of diseases.  When left unresolved, these pathologic processes can lead to abnormal cellular proliferation, tissue fibrosis and remodeling, and organ damage.  By correcting the underlying molecular aberrations, Nrf2 activators may have the potential to prevent these longer-term consequences and improve disease symptoms.  Since mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation are features of many diseases, Nrf2 activators may have many potential clinical applications and have been the subject of more than 200 peer-reviewed scientific papers.
 Bardoxolone Methyl for the Treatment of Rare Chronic Kidney Diseases 
 Overview
 We are developing bardoxolone methyl for the treatment of patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome and four additional rare forms of CKD that, in the aggregate, affect more than half a million patients in the United States.  CKD is characterized by a progressive worsening in the rate at which the kidney filters waste products from the blood, called GFR.  When GFR gets too low, patients develop ESRD and require dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive.  Dialysis increases the likelihood of serious and life-threatening complications, such as cardiovascular disease, and the five-year survival rate for hemodialysis patients is only approximately 40%.  The number of patients with ESRD in the United States has nearly doubled in the last two decades with an estimated 700,000 patients as of 2015.  Approximately 30% of these patients suffer from a rare form of CKD.  There are no approved therapies in the United States for Alport syndrome or the four additional rare forms of CKD addressed by our program.
 We believe that bardoxolone methyl treatment has the potential to delay or prevent the loss of kidney function that causes the need for dialysis or a transplant in patients with Alport syndrome and other rare forms of CKD.  In 11 clinical trials, bardoxolone methyl has been shown to consistently improve kidney function, as assessed by eGFR in patients with a variety of diseases that result in decreased kidney function.  eGFR is an estimate of the kidney’s filtration rate that is used to track the decline in kidney function and progression to ESRD.  In addition to eGFR improvements, bardoxolone methyl treatment has been shown to significantly increase directly-measured GFR using the “gold standard” inulin clearance method and has been shown to reduce the levels of blood waste products filtered by the kidney.  Further, kidney function improvements from bardoxolone methyl treatment are sustained in long term trials.  In two large, international, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients with CKD caused by type 2 diabetes, BEAM and BEACON, bardoxolone methyl treatment produced sustained increases in eGFR for at least one year.  In BEACON, patients that received bardoxolone methyl treatment were more than 50% less likely than patients receiving placebo to experience events that predict kidney failure.  In PAH patients in LARIAT, eGFR improvements from bardoxolone methyl treatment were durable for two years.  Importantly, in BEAM and BEACON, bardoxolone methyl treatment for one year produced a retained eGFR benefit after the drug was withdrawn.  This retained eGFR benefit provides additional evidence that bardoxolone methyl treatment may protect the structure of the kidney and may prevent or delay the need for dialysis or a transplant.
 The FDA has provided us with guidance that, in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome, data demonstrating an improvement versus placebo in retained eGFR after one year of bardoxolone methyl treatment may support accelerated approval, and data demonstrating an improvement versus placebo in retained eGFR after two years of treatment may support full approval.  Based on this guidance, we are conducting a Phase 2/3 trial called CARDINAL in patients with a severe, genetic form of CKD caused by Alport syndrome, and we expect data from the study to be available during the second half of 2019.  Alport syndrome is a rare and serious hereditary disease with no approved therapies that affects both children and adults.  Patients with Alport syndrome experience progressive loss of kidney function and, in patients with the most severe forms of the disease, approximately 50% progress to dialysis by age of 25, 90% by age 40, and nearly 100% by age 60.  
 CARDINAL, which is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in the Phase 3 portion, studies the safety and efficacy of bardoxolone methyl in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome.  Last year, we reported the primary endpoint data for the open label, Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL.  In the Phase 2 portion, bardoxolone methyl demonstrated a statistically significant, mean increase from baseline in eGFR of 13.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.000000001) in 30 patients after 12 weeks of treatment.  All patients had an increase in eGFR from baseline, and these increases in eGFR translated to an improvement in CKD stage for approximately 73% of patients.  Patients in the Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL will continue study drug for two years, and retained eGFR will be assessed after both one and two years of treatment.  We expect to have one year retained eGFR data from the Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL in the third quarter of 2018.  
 6

Because we observed a statistically significant increase in eGFR after 12 weeks of treatment in the Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL, we began enrolling the Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL last year.  The Phase 3 study will enroll approximately 150 patients randomized evenly to either bardoxolone methyl or placebo.  We will measure on-treatment eGFR at 48 weeks and the retained eGFR at 52 weeks.  After 52 weeks, patients will be restarted on study drug with their original treatment assignments and will continue on study drug for a second year.  The second year on-treatment eGFR will be measured after 100 weeks and the retained eGFR will be measured at Week 104.  We expect to have one year top-line results from the Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL available in the second half of 2019.  If successful, we believe the results from the Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL, together with other data from our development program, will be sufficient to form the basis of an NDA submission to the FDA seeking approval for bardoxolone methyl in the United States.
 Because we believe the mechanism of action of bardoxolone methyl addresses a final common pathway of kidney function loss, and because we have observed significant increases in eGFR in patients with declining kidney function from a variety of diseases, we are conducting an additional clinical study to assess whether bardoxolone methyl treatment can increase kidney function, as assessed by eGFR, in patients with four additional rare forms of CKD.  PHOENIX is an open-label, multi-center Phase 2 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bardoxolone methyl in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), IgA nephropathy, type 1 diabetic CKD, or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).  We plan to enroll approximately 25 patients of each of these rare forms of CKD in PHOENIX and to evaluate the effect of bardoxolone methyl treatment on eGFR at 12 weeks.  We have enrolled patients in PHOENIX from each of the four rare forms of CKD, and expect to have data from one or more of the four cohorts available during the second half of 2018.
 Background on Rare Forms of CKD, eGFR, and the Burden of ESRD and Dialysis
 CKD is characterized by a progressive loss in the rate at which the kidney is filtering blood, called GFR.  CKD typically results from diabetic complications, hypertension, obesity, genetic defects, or autoimmunity.  The initiating events that promote CKD can be quite different, but a substantial body of evidence has emerged that chronic inflammation is a common underlying feature for most forms of CKD.  
 Declining kidney function leads to the buildup of high levels of waste products in the blood that causes the patient to suffer symptoms, such as nausea and fatigue, and to develop complications including high blood pressure, anemia, weak bones, poor nutritional health, and nerve damage.  eGFR is an estimate of GFR that nephrologists use to track the decline in kidney function and progression of CKD.  Normal individuals have an eGFR of approximately 120 mL/min/1.73 m2.  When eGFR declines to approximately 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, patients develop ESRD and require dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive.  
 Dialysis can lead to a reduced quality of life as patients must spend several hours at a dialysis clinic three or more times a week for the remainder of their life, and may suffer side effects due to dialysis. Dialysis also increases the likelihood of serious and life-threatening complications, such as cardiovascular disease, and the five-year survival rate for hemodialysis patients is only approximately 40%.  The number of patients with ESRD in the United States has nearly doubled in the last two decades with an estimated 700,000 patients as of 2015.  Approximately 30% of these patients suffer from a rare form of CKD.  In 2015, Medicare spending for CKD was $98 billion, of which $34 billion was spent on patients with ESRD.  The only approved therapies in the United States for any form of CKD that affect disease progression are blood pressure medications, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) approved for diabetic nephropathy, that modestly slow the rate of kidney function loss.  There are no approved therapies in the United States for Alport syndrome or the four additional rare forms of CKD addressed by our program.
 Mechanism of Action of Bardoxolone Methyl in CKD
 Bardoxolone methyl has been evaluated in many preclinical models of CKD and, unlike blood pressure medications, bardoxolone methyl targets inflammation in the kidney.  In preclinical studies that are the subject of more than 40 recent peer-reviewed publications, bardoxolone methyl and related analogs have been shown to reduce inflammation, improve renal function, and prevent injury, remodeling, and fibrosis of the kidney in many animal models of kidney disease.
 In the kidney, the first stage of the blood filtering process takes place in the glomerulus, which consists of a small tuft of capillaries containing endothelial cells, between which are large pores, and mesangial cells, which are modified smooth muscle cells that lie between the capillaries.  Tight coordination between these cell types is necessary for proper filtration.  The pores between the endothelial cells allow for the free filtration of fluid, plasma solutes, and protein.  When endothelial cells become dysfunctional, due to oxidative stress or other reasons, the pores can become more permeable and increase spillage of protein, which can drive further inflammatory signaling and oxidative stress.  The mesangial cells regulate blood flow by their contractile activity, and contraction of the cells reduces surface area for filtration of the blood.  Mesangial cells also remove proteins and other molecules trapped in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), or filtration barrier.

In preclinical models, bardoxolone methyl improves GFR by reducing glomerular inflammation, reversing endothelial dysfunction, and restoring filtration surface area

 
In CKD (left), chronic activation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways results in endothelial dysfunction and thickening of the GBM, such that the filtration surface area is reduced. | Bardoxolone methyl (right) has been shown, in preclinical models, to improve GFR by targeting these pathways and can therefore improve GFR by reducing glomerular inflammation and fibrosis to restore filtration surface area.

 In animal models, bardoxolone methyl and analogs reverse endothelial dysfunction and mesangial cell contraction and increase the surface area of the glomerulus, increasing GFR.  Further, data from animal models demonstrate that the compounds preserve kidney function and prevent fibrosis in multiple settings, including in models of high blood pressure, diabetes, lupus, and excessive protein.
 Clinical Trials of Bardoxolone Methyl in CKD 
 Bardoxolone methyl has been evaluated in multiple clinical trials enrolling over 2,000 patients exposed to active drug, including those with CKD caused by type 2 diabetes, PAH patients, Alport syndrome patients, patients with solid tumors or lymphoma, and healthy volunteers.  Bardoxolone methyl has been shown to consistently improve kidney function as measured by eGFR and other markers of kidney function in numerous clinical trials.  Key features of bardoxolone methyl’s effects on kidney function are summarized below.

 a Change from baseline

filtered by the kidney.  In 2017, our partner, KHK, presented results of its trial, TSUBAKI, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial conducted in Japan.  In TSUBAKI, bardoxolone methyl demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful increases in directly-measured GFR.  Moreover, measured GFR increases were significantly and positively correlated with improvements in eGFR.  The observed increase in GFR demonstrates that increases in eGFR produced by bardoxolone methyl in various forms of CKD, including Alport syndrome, reflect a true increase in kidney function.  In TSUBAKI, bardoxolone methyl demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no adverse effect on blood pressure, urine output or sodium excretion, and no evidence of overt fluid overload or cardiac toxicity.
 In several studies, bardoxolone methyl significantly increased creatinine clearance, another assessment of kidney function.  Importantly, these increases were not associated with a change in total 24 hour excretion of creatinine, which demonstrates that bardoxolone methyl does not affect creatinine metabolism.  In other CKD studies, bardoxolone methyl has been shown to significantly reduce blood waste products in inverse correlation to eGFR increases and to numerically reduce renal serious adverse events (SAEs) and ESRD events.  Taken together, these data demonstrate that the increases in eGFR observed in multiple CKD studies of bardoxolone methyl treatment reflect true increases in GFR and support the use of eGFR as a reliable marker of renal function.
 Bardoxolone Methyl Demonstrated Sustained eGFR Increases for One and Two Years in Duration
 Two separate trials in patients with CKD caused by type 2 diabetes, BEAM and BEACON, showed that increases in eGFR in patients treated for one year or longer with bardoxolone methyl, were sustained for at least one year.  In BEACON, bardoxolone methyl treated patients had mean increases in eGFR through Week 48 of 5.6 mL/min/1.73 m2.  In contrast, placebo-treated patients experienced a mean decline in eGFR of -1.2 mL/min/1.73 m2, corresponding to a statistically significant relative difference between groups of 6.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.001).  In BEAM, bardoxolone methyl treated patients at the mid- and high doses had mean increases in eGFR through Week 48 of 14.9 mL/min/1.73 m2.  In contrast, placebo-treated patients experienced a mean decline in eGFR of -1.1 mL/min/1.73 m2, corresponding to a statistically significant relative difference between groups of 16.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.001).

 a Combined mid/high dose
 In February 2018, we announced that improvements in kidney function were durable for two years in LARIAT.  These data represented the longest analyzed duration patients have received bardoxolone methyl.  Patients in the placebo-controlled, double-blind phase of LARIAT had impaired kidney function upon study entry, with an average eGFR of 73.4 mL/min/1.73 m2.  Patients who received treatment with bardoxolone methyl (n=71) had a statistically significant increase in eGFR compared to placebo (n=30) of 10.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.0001) after 16 weeks of treatment.  
 After completing 16 weeks of treatment, all patients in LARIAT were eligible to receive bardoxolone methyl in an open-label extension study.  At the time of the analysis, 56 patients had received at least 56 weeks of bardoxolone methyl treatment, of which 55 had an eGFR measurement at Week 56.  After 56 weeks of treatment, data demonstrated a statistically significant, mean increase in eGFR of 10.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 from baseline (p<0.0001).  Additionally, 26 patients had received bardoxolone methyl for at least 104 weeks, and after 104 weeks of treatment, data demonstrated a statistically significant, mean increase in eGFR of 11.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 from baseline (p<0.0001).  Notably, 88% of patients on bardoxolone methyl maintained increases in eGFR above baseline after two years of treatment.

In the LARIAT Trial with PAH Patients, Bardoxolone Methyl Demonstrated Changes in eGFR Durable through Two Years of Treatment

PAH patients experience an estimated annual loss of kidney function of approximately 8 to 13 mL/min/1.73 m2 and are extremely sensitive to any adverse perturbations of renal or cardiac function.  Additionally, the median survival for PAH patients from time of diagnosis is four to seven years.  Upon study entry, the LARIAT PAH patients had a median time since diagnosis of 3.3 years (n=101; 66 weeks median duration of treatment).  At the time of this analysis, LARIAT PAH patients had experienced a lower rate of hospitalization when compared to recent registrational and observational PAH studies, and there were no deaths among these LARIAT PAH patients.
 Bardoxolone Methyl Significantly Reduced the Risk of Adverse Renal Events Validated to Predict Kidney Failure
 In January 2018, a paper was published in the American Journal of Nephrology that included a characterization of bardoxolone methyl’s efficacy and longer-term effects on kidney function in BEACON.  In this study, post-hoc analysis showed that patients randomized to bardoxolone methyl were significantly less likely to experience adverse kidney outcomes as defined by a composite renal endpoint consisting of ≥30% decline from baseline in eGFR, eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2, or ESRD events (p<0.0001).  This composite endpoint has recently been validated by a joint FDA, European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the National Kidney Foundation working group.  Furthermore, bardoxolone methyl treatment resulted in a decreased number of kidney-related SAEs and ESRD events.  The authors concluded that bardoxolone methyl preserves kidney function and may delay the onset of kidney failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 4 CKD.

Bardoxolone Methyl Produces a Retained eGFR Benefit after Withdrawal of Drug
 To further assess whether increases in eGFR from bardoxolone methyl treatment have the potential to delay or prevent ESRD and the need for dialysis or a transplant over the long term, we conducted a retained benefit analysis in the BEAM and BEACON clinical trials.  In those trials, after patients had been treated with bardoxolone methyl or placebo for approximately one year, the drug was withdrawn for four weeks, and the post-withdrawal eGFR was compared to the patient’s baseline eGFR.  Bardoxolone methyl and any active metabolites are eliminated from the body within approximately 10 days after withdrawal, so we believe the post-withdrawal eGFR change is a measure of the effect of long term bardoxolone methyl treatment on the structure of the kidney and its disease-modifying potential.
 Bardoxolone Methyl Produced Post-Withdrawal eGFR Benefit in BEAM and BEACON 
  
 | Baseline eGFR | Placebo-corrected Post-week 48 Withdrawal Δ eGFR | WK 12/Post-Withdrawal Correlation
---------------------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------
BEAM (Mid/High Dose) | 32 | 4.8 (p<0.05) | r=0.53 (p<0.001) 
BEACON | 23 | 1.8 (p<0.001) | r=0.43 (p<0.001) 

 
Importantly, in both BEAM and BEACON, bardoxolone methyl treatment produced a statistically significant improvement in retained eGFR versus placebo after withdrawal of drug.  Also, the acute increase in eGFR from bardoxolone methyl treatment observed at 12 weeks was predictive of both the on-treatment and retained eGFR benefit after one year of treatment.  This finding is important because it indicates that increases in eGFR from a relatively short, 12 week, treatment periods with bardoxolone methyl may be predictive of a long term clinical benefit.  
 CKD Caused by Alport Syndrome
 The FDA has provided guidance to us and other sponsors that clinical trials with a retained benefit analysis may support approval in rare forms of CKD.  Specifically, the FDA has indicated that, in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome, data demonstrating an improvement versus placebo in retained eGFR after one year of bardoxolone methyl treatment may support accelerated approval, and data demonstrating an improvement versus placebo in retained eGFR after two years of treatment may support full approval.  On the basis of this guidance, we are conducting a Phase 2/3 trial called CARDINAL in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome.  
 Alport syndrome is a rare and serious hereditary disease caused by mutations in the genes encoding type IV collagen, a major structural component of the GBM in the kidney.  The expression of abnormal type IV collagen causes loss of GBM integrity, abnormal leakage of proteins through the GBM, and excessive reabsorption of protein in the proximal tubules of the kidney.  As in other forms of CKD, excessive reabsorption of protein in the tubules induces oxidative stress, renal interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis.  Patients with Alport syndrome experience an average annual decline in eGFR of 3 to 4 mL/min/1.73 m2.  In patients with the most severe forms of Alport syndrome, approximately 50% progress to dialysis by age of 25, 90% by age 40, and nearly 100% by age 60.  Currently, there are no approved therapies for the treatment of CKD caused by Alport syndrome.  The goal of current disease management is to slow the progression of CKD, beginning with anti-hypertensives, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs, which are intended to reduce the rate of kidney function loss.  Like patients with other forms of CKD, Alport syndrome patients receiving dialysis are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease and infections, which are the most common causes of death in these patients.

Clinical Development for Bardoxolone Methyl in CKD Caused by Alport Syndrome
 CARDINAL, which is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in the Phase 3 portion, studies the safety and efficacy of bardoxolone methyl in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome.  Last year, we reported the primary endpoint data for the open label, Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL, which enrolled 30 patients.  The primary endpoint data demonstrated that bardoxolone methyl significantly increased kidney function in Alport syndrome patients as measured by eGFR.  From a mean baseline eGFR of 54 mL/min/1.73 m2, data showed a statistically significant mean increase of 13.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 at Week 12 (p<0.000000001).  All patients demonstrated increases in eGFR at Week 12, with 87% of patients demonstrating a clinically meaningful increase in eGFR of at least 4.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 63% of patients demonstrating an increase in eGFR of at least 10.0 mL/min/1.73 m2.  Additionally, 73% of patients had an improvement in CKD stage, and none worsened.  Clinically meaningful increases in eGFR were demonstrated across multiple subgroups, with activity in both earlier and later stages of disease.

All eGFR amounts in table are measured in mL/min/1.73 m2.

 As of the 12-week primary endpoint visit for the Phase 2 portion, no discontinuations or SAEs were reported, and reported adverse events (AEs) were generally mild to moderate in intensity.  Consistent with prior studies, the most common AEs that were reported in more than two patients were muscle spasms (15/30; 50%), headache (4/30; 13%), nausea (4/30; 13%), fatigue (4/30; 13%), and hyperkalemia (3/30; 10%).  Muscle spasms were generally transient and were associated with reductions of creatine kinase, which is evidence of improved energy metabolism and inconsistent with muscle injury.  Patients in the Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL will continue on study drug for two years, and a retained benefit analysis after withdrawal of drug will be performed after both one and two years of treatment.  Retained eGFR data at 52 weeks from the Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL are expected to be available in the third quarter of 2018.
 Because we observed a significant increase in eGFR after 12 weeks of treatment in the Phase 2 portion of CARDINAL, we began enrolling the Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL last year.  The Phase 3 study will enroll approximately 150 patients randomized evenly to either bardoxolone methyl or placebo.  We will assess on-treatment eGFR at 48 weeks and retained eGFR at 52 weeks.  After 52 weeks, patients will be restarted on study drug with their original treatment assignments and will continue on study drug for a second year.  The second year on-treatment eGFR will be measured after 100 weeks and the retained eGFR will be measured at Week 104.  We expect to have one year top-line data from the Phase 3 portion of CARDINAL available in the second half of 2019.  We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for bardoxolone methyl for the treatment of Alport syndrome.
 The trial is being overseen by a data monitoring committee (DMC) that reviews all data, including SAE and AE data, on an unblinded basis, to assess safety.  The DMC has not reported any safety concerns to date.
 Market Opportunity for Bardoxolone Methyl in Chronic Kidney Disease Caused by Alport Syndrome
 There are no therapies currently approved for CKD caused by Alport syndrome.  Alport syndrome is a rare and serious hereditary disease that we believe, based on literature, affects approximately 12,000 children and adults in the United States and 40,000 globally.  Approximately 1,200 of the United States patients are identified in the Alport Syndrome Foundation’s registry.  Patients with Alport syndrome are often misdiagnosed with other congenital kidney diseases.  In addition, family members of patients with Alport syndrome may not be formally diagnosed.  We believe that, with the development of an effective treatment for Alport syndrome, identification of patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome will increase.
Bardoxolone Methyl for the Treatment of Other Rare Kidney Diseases
 Because we believe the mechanism of action of bardoxolone methyl addresses a final common pathway kidney function loss and because we have observed significant increases in eGFR in patients with declining kidney function from a variety of diseases, we are conducting an additional clinical study to assess whether bardoxolone methyl treatment can improve kidney function in patients with four additional rare forms of CKD, including ADPKD, IgA nephropathy, type 1 diabetic CKD, and FSGS.  There are no therapies currently approved for these rare forms of CKD, except for tolvaptan for the treatment of ADPKD, which was approved outside of the United States.  ADPKD is an inherited, rare form of CKD characterized by formation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys.  There are an estimated 116,000 diagnosed ADPKD patients in the United States.  IgA nephropathy is a rare form of CKD caused by deposition of IgA complexes in the kidney and is estimated to affect 120,000 patients in the United States.  CKD is a common complication of type 1 diabetes and is estimated to affect 20% of the approximately one million type 1 diabetes patients in the United States.  FSGS is a rare form of CKD that results from scarring and chronic inflammation of the glomeruli and affects an estimated 55,000 patients in the United States.
 12

PHOENIX is an open-label, multi-center Phase 2 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bardoxolone methyl in patients with ADPKD, IgA nephropathy, type 1 diabetic CKD, or FSGS.  We plan to enroll approximately 25 patients of each of these rare forms of CKD and to evaluate the effect of bardoxolone methyl treatment on kidney function, as assessed by eGFR after 12 weeks of treatment.  Since eGFR data at 12 weeks has correlated with longer term on-treatment and retained eGFR benefit, we plan to utilize information from the Phase 2 trial to determine what indications to prioritize and move forward into registrational studies.  We have enrolled patients in PHOENIX from each of the four rare forms of CKD, and expect to have top-line data from one or more of the four cohorts available during the second half of 2018.
 Bardoxolone Methyl History of Development in Diabetic CKD
 Prior to initiating the current clinical development programs in CTD-PAH and CKD caused by Alport syndrome, bardoxolone methyl was evaluated in six Phase 1 and 2 studies that demonstrated significant improvements in kidney function as evidenced by increases in eGFR and other markers of kidney function as discussed above.  Based on the Phase 2 results, we conducted BEACON, a large, multinational Phase 3 trial in patients with CKD caused by type 2 diabetes.  In 2010, when the study was initiated, guidance from the FDA required that the study demonstrate that bardoxolone methyl treatment significantly reduce the risk of ESRD and death events for approval.  Because CKD patients’ kidney function declines very slowly over a long period of time, BEACON enrolled only severe or Stage 4 CKD patients that had baseline eGFR values close to the threshold for ESRD.
 During October 2012, BEACON was terminated early in response to the independent DMC’s recommendation to stop the trial for safety concerns.  After the trial was terminated, analysis revealed that there was a small but significant imbalance in heart failure events of 5.0% on placebo and 8.8% on active drug, but no statistical difference in mortality.  The primary reason for the increase in heart failure events was fluid overload that occurred in the first four weeks after randomization.  Patients with fluid overload events who were treated with intravenous diuretics resolved their symptoms, and there was no increase in risk for fluid overload, as compared to placebo, after the first four weeks of treatment.
 Further investigation, including additional preclinical studies, indicated that bardoxolone methyl modulates the endothelin pathway.  In patients with Stage 4 and 5 CKD caused by diabetes, the endothelin pathway is dysregulated and, under certain circumstances, activation of this pathway can put these patients at greater risk for fluid retention.  Patients who have less compromised kidney function do not have dysregulation of this pathway, and their kidneys are able to excrete excess fluid.  Similar fluid overload events had been observed previously in patients with late-stage CKD caused by diabetes treated with other therapies, including endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs), which are vasodilating agents that are currently approved for the treatment of PAH.  This review of data from PAH trials prompted our interest in the applicability of the pharmacology of Nrf2 activators, particularly their mitochondrial and anti-inflammatory effects, to PAH.  
 Post-hoc analysis from BEACON identified three major risk factors as predictors of fluid overload events: Stage 4 CKD caused by diabetes, prior hospitalization for heart failure, and baseline elevation in B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a clinical chemistry measure of fluid status.  Bardoxolone methyl-treated patients that experienced heart failure events in BEACON had mean BNP values at baseline and before receiving study drug of approximately 550 pg/mL.  Normal BNP levels are 100 pg/mL, suggesting many of the patients with fluid overload were in heart failure prior to randomization.  Patients without these risk factors showed no imbalance in heart failure events or mortality, which is consistent with the Phase 2 trials conducted by us that primarily enrolled in patients with Stage 3 CKD caused by diabetes and did not show a risk of fluid overload.  There were no other significant adverse safety findings from the BEACON trial, and patients in the treatment arm had fewer kidney and liver-related SAEs than patients in the placebo arm.  
 Based on these findings, we resumed clinical development of bardoxolone methyl, excluding at-risk patients by using identified risk factors and closely monitoring trial participants for signs and symptoms of fluid retention during the first few weeks after treatment initiation.  Risk mitigation features have been implemented in all clinical trials of bardoxolone methyl in CKD patients including CARDINAL, our global Phase 2/3 study of patients with Alport syndrome, and PHOENIX, a study in patients with CKD due to FSGS, type 1 diabetes mellitus, IgA nephropathy, or ADPKD.  Our partner, KHK, implemented risk mitigation features in TSUBAKI, their clinical study of bardoxolone methyl in patients with type 2 diabetes and Stage 3 and 4 CKD in Japan. We have also implemented risk mitigation procedures in CATALYST, our global Phase 3 study of patients with CTD-PAH, and LARIAT, our Phase 2 study of patients with PAH.  The risk mitigation strategies adopted for bardoxolone methyl and omaveloxolone are similar to those adopted by developers of endothelin receptor antagonists.  For example, the inclusion/exclusion criteria for trials studying AbbVie’s ERA atrasentan and Retrophin’s ERA/ARB drug sparsentan utilize a patient’s prior history of heart failure, current heart failure, and elevated BNP as key components of their exclusion criteria.
 To date, none of these studies have shown an increased risk for acute fluid overload AEs with bardoxolone methyl treatment.  The absence of overt fluid overload or subclinical measures of heart failure, including meaningful increases in blood pressure, BNP, or body weight, in these studies support that prospectively enrolling patients who are not at risk for heart failure may effectively mitigate the risk for acute heart failure with bardoxolone methyl previously seen in patients with diabetes and late-stage CKD.
 Omaveloxolone for the Treatment of Neuromuscular Diseases
 Our lead program in neuromuscular diseases is FA, which is currently in the registrational part 2 of a Phase 2 trial.  Neuromuscular diseases are commonly driven by impairment of mitochondrial function, due to the high energy demand of the nervous system.  All 
 13

components of the neuromuscular system, including muscle, the neuromuscular junction, peripheral nerves, spinal cord, and the brain, can be affected.  These diseases include ataxias, stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and many others.  These diseases can strike as early as infancy, and symptoms can include poor growth, loss of muscle coordination, muscle weakness, visual problems, hearing problems, learning disabilities, neurological problems, autonomic dysfunction, and dementia. 
 Friedreich’s Ataxia
 FA is an inherited, debilitating, and degenerative neuromuscular disorder, caused by a mutation in the frataxin gene, which is typically diagnosed during adolescence, and can ultimately lead to early death.  A mutation in the frataxin gene leads to impaired transcription and reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin.  Deficiency of frataxin in cells leads to a mitochondrial iron overload and poor cellular iron regulation, increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, and impaired mitochondrial ATP production.  Impaired ATP production in FA patients likely accounts for the decreased coordination, progressive muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, and fatigue observed in these patients, as well as other disease manifestations.  Patients with FA experience progressive loss of coordination, muscle weakness, and fatigue, which commonly progresses to motor incapacitation and wheelchair reliance.  FA patients may also experience visual impairment, hearing loss, diabetes, and cardiomyopathy.  
 Childhood-onset FA can occur as early as age five, is more common than later-onset FA, and typically involves more rapid disease progression.  Most FA patients have disease onset by approximately 13 to 15 years of age, and thereafter, have a mean duration until wheelchair use of 10 to 15 years.  The median age of death is in the mid-30s.  There are no currently approved therapies for the treatment of FA.  Patients are usually given guidelines around certain lifestyle habits and are recommended to follow a diet that is low in iron and encouraged to take vitamins and supplements.  
Rationale for Omaveloxolone in Friedreich’s Ataxia
 Because impaired ATP production in FA patients likely accounts for the decreased coordination, progressive muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, and fatigue observed in these patients, as well as other disease manifestations, we believe that omaveloxolone may be effective in treating this indication.  In FA patients, mitochondrial function is correlated with measures of neurologic function.  Further, data demonstrate that Nrf2 signaling is significantly impaired in FA patients, resulting in impairment of antioxidant defense mechanisms, while silencing of frataxin gene expression has been linked to decreases in expression of Nrf2.  Additionally, omaveloxolone has been shown in vitro to restore mitochondrial activity in fibroblasts isolated from FA patients.  Accordingly, we believe that Nrf2 activation through omaveloxolone may result in a clinical benefit to FA patients.
 Clinical Development for Omaveloxolone in FA
 We are evaluating omaveloxolone in the MOXIe trial, a two-part international, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation, registrational Phase 2 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of omaveloxolone in patients with FA.  All dose groups had small sample sizes and were not powered to demonstrate statistical significance.  Data from part 1 of the trial demonstrated that, the maximum effect on mFARS scores was observed at the 160 mg dose level, which was administered to a total of 12 patients, with a statistically significant improvement in mFARS scores of 3.8 points versus baseline (p=0.0001) and of 2.3 points relative to placebo (approached statistical significance, p=0.06).  We observed that omaveloxolone produced greater improvements in mFARS scores in patients that did not have a preexisting musculoskeletal foot deformity that causes high arched feet, called pes cavus, with the maximum effect on mFARS scores at the 160 mg dose level, showing a statistically significant improvement at Week 12 of 6.0 points versus baseline (p<0.0001) and of 4.4 points relative to placebo (p=0.01).  The observed improvement in mFARS scores at Week 12 for the 7 placebo patients without pes cavus of 1.6 points was similar to that observed in all 17 placebo patients of 1.4 points.  Data from the 160 mg dose are shown in the graph below.
14

mFARS Improved with 160 mg Dose

The trial is being overseen by a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) that reviews all data, including SAE and AE data, on an unblinded basis to assess safety.  No safety concerns were identified by the DSMB in part 1 of MOXIe and only two SAEs were reported, with both events occurring in placebo-treated patients.  The most common AEs in excess to placebo in the omaveloxolone group were upper respiratory tract infections and nasopharyngitis, which were generally mild in severity.  Omaveloxolone was reported to be well-tolerated with only a single discontinuation in a 40 mg patient who developed a skin rash.  One placebo patient discontinued prematurely due to withdrawal of consent.
 We are conducting part 2 of MOXIe, which will enroll approximately 100 FA patients randomized evenly to either 150 mg of omaveloxolone or placebo.  The primary endpoint of the trial is the change from baseline in mFARS score in patients treated with omaveloxolone compared to placebo at 48 weeks.  Additional endpoints will include the change from baseline in peak work during maximal exercise testing, Patient Global Impression of Change, and Clinical Global Impression of Change.  All patients who complete the treatment period are eligible to continue into an extension trial to evaluate the intermediate and long-term safety of omaveloxolone.  Those patients who had been receiving placebo will be converted to omaveloxolone in the extension trial.  The FDA has confirmed that mFARS is acceptable as the primary endpoint for part 2 of MOXIe and that it may consider either accelerated or full approval based on the overall results of the trial and strength of the data.  We expect to complete MOXIe and have top-line data available in the second half of 2019.  We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for omaveloxolone for the treatment of FA.
 We have observed no significant tolerability issues in MOXIe to date.  The DSMB has not reported any safety concerns to date.
 Market Opportunity for Omaveloxolone in Friedreich’s Ataxia
 FA is an ultra-orphan disease with a prevalence ranging from 0.7 to 5 per 100,000 in Caucasians globally.  Based on literature and proprietary research, we believe there are approximately 22,000 people globally with FA, including 6,000 in the United States.  Approximately 2,700 worldwide patients are identified on the Friedreich’s Ataxia Research Alliance’s registry, including approximately 1,500 in the United States.  Patients with FA are often undiagnosed or are misdiagnosed with a different cerebellar ataxia.  However, we believe that if an effective treatment for FA is approved and marketed, more patients will be genetically tested for and diagnosed with FA.
 15

Omaveloxolone in Other Neuromuscular Diseases
 In addition to the MOXIe trial in FA, we recently conducted MOTOR, an exploratory, dose-escalation Phase 2 trial, evaluating the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics activity of omaveloxolone in patients with mitochondrial myopathies (MM), a multi-systemic group of heterogenous myopathies that are caused by over 200 different genetic mutations.  The sample size of six to ten patients randomized to omaveloxolone and two to three randomized to placebo at each dose level was based on a traditional dose-escalation design.  The small number of patients at each dose was not expected to fully characterize safety, efficacy, or pharmacodynamics, but rather to inform the DSMB and us of the appropriate dose to select for future study.  Omaveloxolone did not improve peak work or 6-minute walk distance versus placebo, which were the primary and secondary endpoints of the trial.  However, at the optimal dose of 160 mg, significant, placebo-corrected improvements were noted in Nrf2 biomarkers.  Additionally, in the submaximal exercise test, which is a more sensitive assessment of mitochondrial function, a significant lowering of heart rate and blood lactate levels versus placebo was observed.  At Week 12, patients treated with 160 mg of omaveloxolone demonstrated a placebo-corrected reduction in heart rate of 12.0 beats per minute (p=0.01) and blood lactate of 1.3 mM (p=0.04).  The decrease in heart rate and lactate levels produced by omaveloxolone are indicative of improved mitochondrial function and may be useful in determining the development path of omaveloxolone.  The DSMB did not report any safety concerns in the trial.  
 We plan to continue evaluating data for omaveloxolone in our neuromuscular trials, as well as regulatory endpoints in the neuromuscular disease space, to determine our next steps in development.  
 Bardoxolone Methyl for the Treatment of CTD-PAH and Other Pulmonary Hypertension Diseases
 Our lead program in the pulmonary hypertension (PH) space is in CTD-PAH, which is currently in a Phase 3 trial called CATALYST.  Mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and proliferative signaling are common to the pathophysiology of many pulmonary hypertensive diseases.  In addition, the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties of bardoxolone methyl may be relevant to preventing remodeling of pulmonary vasculature and may lead to longer term positive effects in the diseases.  
 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Associated with Connective Tissue Disease 
 PAH results in a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, which ultimately leads to right ventricular heart failure and death.  Female PAH patients outnumber males by a factor of two to one, and the onset of PAH generally occurs between the ages of 40 and 60, with the average age of onset being 53.  CTD-PAH is a late and often fatal manifestation of many types of autoimmune disease, including systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, and others.  In comparison to patients with I-PAH, CTD-PAH patients are generally less responsive to existing therapies, have a worse prognosis, and experience a higher occurrence of small vessel fibrosis and pulmonary veno-obstructive diseases.  CTD-PAH represents approximately 30% of the overall PAH population and approximately 10-15% of patients with scleroderma or lupus erythematosus.  In the United States, the five-year survival rate for CTD-PAH patients is approximately 44% compared to I-PAH patients, who have a 68% five-year survival rate, and scleroderma patients with CTD-PAH have a five-year survival rate of approximately 10%, compared to a five-year survival rate of 85% for scleroderma patients without CTD-PAH.
 Three classes of drugs are currently used to treat all etiologies of PAH: ERAs, nitric oxide pathway modulators, and prostacyclins pathway agonists.  These agents are all systemic vasodilators that do not address the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation in PAH.  Furthermore, their systemic hemodynamic effects can result in hypotension and syncope, or fainting, which generally limit their clinical effectiveness and can be exacerbated by clinically significant drug-drug interactions when used in combination. 
 Vasodilators approved for PAH also generally do not yield as significant functional improvements in CTD-PAH patients as I-PAH patients.  A meta-analysis of 11 registrational trials comprised of more than 2,700 PAH patients published in the November 2015 issue of American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine demonstrated that CTD-PAH patients benefit less from vasodilator therapies then I-PAH patients when measured by clinical worsening and improvements in 6MWD, with a response in CTD-PAH patients (9.6 meters) of approximately one-third of the response in I-PAH patients (30 meters).
 Clinical Development for Bardoxolone Methyl in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Associated with Connective Tissue Disease
 We are conducting CATALYST, a multi-center, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial examining the safety and efficacy of bardoxolone methyl in patients with CTD-PAH when added to standard-of-care vasodilator therapy.  Patients will be on up to two background therapies and will be randomized evenly to either bardoxolone methyl or placebo, and the study drug will be administered once daily for 24 weeks.  Patients randomized to bardoxolone methyl will start at 5 mg and will dose-escalate to 10 mg at Week 4 unless contraindicated clinically.  Based on discussion with the FDA, the primary endpoint of the study is the change from baseline in 6MWD relative to placebo at Week 24.  The trial will enroll between 130 and 200 patients, and all patients who complete the treatment period are eligible to continue into an extension trial to evaluate the intermediate and long-term safety of bardoxolone methyl.  Those patients who had been receiving placebo will be converted to bardoxolone methyl in the extension trial.  Data from CATALYST are expected to be available during the second half of 2018.  The final sample size will be determined by a pre-specified, blinded sample size re-calculation based on 6MWD variability and baseline characteristics.  The timing of data release may change if the sample size increases.  We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of PAH. 
 16

CATALYST was designed based on data from LARIAT.  Based on findings in LARIAT, patients with moderate to severe anemia, which represent a small percentage of the patient population, are being excluded from CATALYST because data demonstrated that treatment with iron supplementation or erythropoietin can affect 6MWD values independent of study drug effect.  The primary endpoint in CATALYST, which will be analyzed using the mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) statistical analysis method, is the placebo-corrected change in 6MWD from baseline to the end-of-treatment at 24 weeks.  As part of the planning to determine sample size for CATALYST, we performed an analysis applying the MMRM statistical analysis method for CATALYST to the available end-of-treatment change in 6MWD data from CTD-PAH patients in LARIAT.  The summary of our analysis using the change at the end of treatment period on all patients and patients without anemia is shown in the table below.
 End-of-Treatment 6MWD Changes for CTD-PAH Patients in LARIAT
 
 
 | | All Patients | | Patients Without Anemia
-------------------+----+--------------------------+-----------------------+------------------------
Treatment | N | Change from Baseline (m) | Placebo-corrected (m) | N | Change from Baseline (m) | Placebo-corrected (m)
Placebo | 7 | 9.8 p=0.44 | — | 5 | -5.8 p=0.68 | — 
Bardoxolone Methyl | 15 | 38.2 p<0.001 | 28.4 p=0.07 | 14 | 42.7 p<0.001 | 48.5 p=0.005 

 CATALYST is designed to detect a minimum treatment effect of 12.5 meters versus placebo assuming a standard deviation of 50 meters.  The observed treatment effect in the LARIAT CTD-PAH subgroup analyses, both with and without the anemic patients included, is meaningfully larger than the minimally detectable treatment effect in CATALYST.
 CATALYST is overseen by a DSMB that reviews all data, including SAE and AE data, on an unblinded basis to assess safety.  The DSMB has not reported any safety concerns to date.
 Rationale for Bardoxolone Methyl in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Associated with Connective Tissue Disease
 Bardoxolone methyl directly targets the bioenergetic and inflammatory components of PAH.  PAH patients experience mitochondrial dysfunction, increased NF-kB activity, and related inflammatory pathways involved in ROS-mediated signaling, cellular proliferation, and fibrosis.  Bardoxolone methyl, through the combined effect of Nrf2 activation and NF-kB suppression, has the potential to inhibit inflammatory and proliferative signaling, suppress ROS production and signaling, reduce the production of proteins related to fibrosis and tissue remodeling, and increase cellular respiration and ATP production.  Bardoxolone methyl targets multiple cell types relevant to PAH, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages.  Additionally, unlike current therapies, bardoxolone methyl does not cause systemic hemodynamic effects or drug-drug interactions in PAH patients.  Therefore, by addressing a novel pathway in PAH, we believe that bardoxolone methyl may provide additional benefits beyond current PAH therapies, including increased functional capacity, effects beyond functional improvements, broader applicability, and as a combination therapy.
Market Opportunity for Bardoxolone Methyl in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Associated with Connective Tissue Disease
 We believe there is significant opportunity for once-daily, orally administered bardoxolone methyl to address the PAH market currently served only by the existing vasodilator therapies.  In 2015, global sales of approved PAH treatments were approximately $4.7 billion.  In addition, recently approved treatments such as Opsumit® and Adempas® have shown rapid uptake in the PAH market and, based on industry reports, Opsumit® is projected to reach between $1 and $2 billion in annual sales within seven years from launch.  Based on literature and proprietary research, we believe there are approximately 12,000 CTD-PAH patients in the United States and 50,000 worldwide.  
Bardoxolone Methyl for the Treatment of Other Pulmonary Hypertension Diseases
 In addition to our Phase 3 trial in CTD-PAH, we are conducting LARIAT, an exploratory, dose-escalation Phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of bardoxolone methyl in patients with PH due to interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD), including PH-ILD caused by sarcoidosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  PH-ILD is a set of serious progressive diseases that ultimately lead to right ventricular heart failure and death.  There are no therapies currently approved for PH-ILD.  While approved vasodilators are sometimes used off-label, given the degree of remodeling and fibrosis present in the lung tissue and vasculature of PH-ILD patients, they are minimally effective.  Several current PAH therapies have been tested in PH-ILD patients and have resulted in little to no reproducible clinical improvement.  
 17

The primary endpoint of LARIAT is the change in 6MWD during a 16 week treatment period.  We have observed no significant tolerability issues in LARIAT to date.  The trial utilizes a protocol safety review committee (PSRC) that reviews all data, including SAE and AE data, on an unblinded basis to assess safety.  The PSRC has not reported any safety concerns to date, and top-line data are expected to be available in the first quarter of 2018.
 Other Clinical Programs
 In addition to our three lead programs, we are currently exploring a battery of additional programs in diseases that may include meaningful expansion opportunities.  Once we have received data on all of our earlier stage programs, we plan to evaluate all data to determine which indications to prioritize and move forward.
 Omaveloxolone for the Treatment of Melanoma
 We are evaluating omaveloxolone in the REVEAL trial, an open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation Phase 1b/2 trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of omaveloxolone, in combination with existing immunotherapies in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.  We completed enrollment of the trial and announced interim data from the Phase 1b portion of the trial, which showed an overall response rate observed in REVEAL of 8/30 (27%, 6 partial responses and 2 complete responses).  We have observed no significant tolerability issues in REVEAL to date. The REVEAL trial is being overseen by a PSRC that reviews all data, including SAE and AE data, to assess safety.  The PSRC has not reported any safety concerns in the trial to date.  We plan to complete our evaluation of data to determine next steps.  
 RTA 901 for the Treatment of Orphan Neurological Indications
 We have conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of RTA 901 in healthy adult volunteers.  The trial was designed in two parts, part 1 with single ascending doses and part 2 with multiple ascending doses.  In part 1, 48 healthy subjects were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single dose of RTA 901 or placebo, respectively.  In part 2, 30 healthy subjects were randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive 14 daily doses of RTA 901 or placebo, respectively.  We encountered no safety or tolerability issues, and observed an acceptable pharmacokinetic profile in the trial.
 Our Hsp90 modulators, including RTA 901, are highly potent and selective C-terminal modulators of Hsp90.  Modulation of Hsp90 may induce expression of Hsp70, a molecular chaperone that plays a critical role in the process through which a protein assumes its functional shape and that serves as a central gatekeeper for mitochondrial protein import.  Mitochondria rely on Hsp70-dependent protein import mechanisms for almost all of their activity, including the production of ATP.  There are also indications that Hsp70 activation may play a profound role in neuroprotection since nerve cells are high consumers of ATP and rely on Hsp70-dependent protein import for proper mitochondrial function.  We have observed favorable activity of RTA 901 in a range of preclinical models of neurodegeneration and neuroprotection, including models of diabetic neuropathy, neural inflammation, and neuropathic pain.  RTA 901, administered orally once-daily, has been observed to rescue existing nerve function, restore thermal and mechanical sensitivity, and improve nerve conductance velocity and mitochondrial function in rodent disease models.
 Preclinical Programs
 RORgT Inhibitors
 We are pursuing preclinical development of novel, small-molecule, orally bioavailable RORgT inhibitors.  RORgT is the master regulator of human T Helper 17 (Th17), cellular differentiation, function, and cytokine production, and represents a compelling target for a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.  Th17 cells produce cytokines, including IL-17, that play a critical role in driving immune-mediated inflammation and are implicated in the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune diseases.  The efficacy of suppressing IL-17 as a means of treating these conditions has been demonstrated both in animal models and in humans.  We have selected RTA 1701 to advance towards a Phase 1 clinical trial. 
Additional Nrf2 Activator Indications

 If beneficial bioenergetic effects are demonstrated in our ongoing CKD caused by Alport syndrome, FA, and CTD-PAH trials, this could indicate that our Nrf2 activator pharmacology may also provide therapeutic benefit for patients suffering from other diseases where mitochondrial dysfunction or chronic inflammation is implicated.  In addition, if therapeutic benefits are demonstrated in CKD caused by Alport syndrome, the Nrf2 activator pharmacology may also provide therapeutic benefit in other kidney diseases.  Some of these diseases may be treated by our current lead product candidates, bardoxolone methyl and omaveloxolone.
 18

Additional Hsp90 Modulator Indications
 If beneficial neuroprotective and bioenergetic effects are demonstrated in our future Phase 2 trials, this could indicate that our Hsp90 modulator pharmacology may also provide therapeutic benefit for patients suffering from other diseases where neurodegeneration and mitochondrial dysfunction are implicated.
Collaborations
 KHK Agreement
 In December 2009, we entered into an agreement with KHK, under which we provided KHK the right to develop and commercialize bardoxolone methyl for renal, cardiovascular, diabetes, and certain related metabolic indications in Japan, China (including Hong Kong and Macao), South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia.  These indications include, among others, CKD and PH.
 KHK is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct all preclinical and clinical activities necessary for the commercialization of licensed products in each country in the licensed territory.  KHK is not participating in the development program for bardoxolone methyl in PH or other rare kidney diseases at this time but is reimbursing us the majority of the costs for our registrational trial in CKD caused by Alport syndrome in Japan.  Under this agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply KHK with clinical supply of licensed product required for KHK’s development in the licensed territory, and we are obligated to negotiate and execute commercial supply agreements with KHK.
 Consideration under this agreement includes an upfront payment of $35 million, up to $97 million in development and regulatory milestone payments, and up to $140 million in commercial milestone payments.  Total consideration under this agreement could reach $272 million.  The aggregate amount of such consideration received through December 31, 2017, totals $50 million.  We expect to recognize $30 million in deferred revenue related to a milestone payment from KHK upon initiation of its Phase 3 trial in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD in 2018.  Additionally, KHK is required to pay us royalties on net sales of licensed product sold by KHK, its affiliates, and sublicensees in its territory ranging from the low teens to the low 20 percent range depending on the country of sale and the amount of annual net sales.
 The KHK agreement will terminate automatically when the royalty term expires in all of KHK’s territory.  A royalty term expires in a country on the later of the expiration of all patents in such country and ten years after the first commercial sale in such country.  Either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency or uncured material breach.  Additionally, KHK may terminate the agreement at will upon advance written notice.  In the event of any termination of the agreement by us for KHK’s uncured breach, bankruptcy or insolvency or by KHK at will, KHK will transfer and assign to us the regulatory filings for bardoxolone methyl and will license to us the relevant trademarks used with the products in their respective territories.
 AbbVie License Agreement
 In September 2010, we entered into a license agreement with AbbVie, under which we provided AbbVie, formerly known as Abbott Pharmaceuticals PR Ltd., the exclusive right to conduct all regulatory activities, including obtaining regulatory approval, and commercialization of bardoxolone methyl or other molecules for renal, metabolic, and cardiovascular indications, including CKD and PH, in all other countries outside the United States not previously licensed to KHK under the KHK agreement.  Under this agreement we retain the right to commercialize bardoxolone methyl in the United States.  Also, both parties are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop bardoxolone methyl in accordance with agreed upon development plans.
 Under this agreement, AbbVie is required to pay us consideration in the form of an upfront payment and development and commercial milestone payments.  For each of the three licensed indications under this agreement, we are eligible to receive up to either $300 million or $350 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments depending on the licensed indication and the number of compounds to achieve such milestones, however, these payments may only be made once per molecule developed.  The aggregate amount of such consideration received through December 31, 2017 totaled $300 million, with a potential $50 million milestone related to commercial sales remaining.  Additionally, AbbVie is required to pay us, under the AbbVie license agreement, tiered royalties on net sales of licensed product sold by AbbVie, its affiliates and sublicensees in its territory ranging from 15 percent to the high 20 percent range depending on the amount of annual net sales.
 At present, AbbVie has exercised their opt-out right with regard to CTD-PAH and PH-ILD and has not opted in to the development program in CKD caused by Alport syndrome or other rare kidney diseases, and therefore is not co-funding our development programs in these indications.  AbbVie has the right to opt-in to these programs at any time during development.  Upon opting-in, AbbVie would be required to pay an agreed upon amount of all development costs accumulated up to the point of exercising their opt-in right.  All development costs incurred after AbbVie’s opt-in would be split equally.
 The AbbVie license agreement will terminate automatically when the royalty term expires in all countries in AbbVie’s territory.  The royalty term expires in a country on the later to occur of (i) the expiration of all patents and regulatory exclusivity, unless prior to such 
 19

expirations generic sales have exceeded a certain percentage of all sales in a quarter, and (ii) ten years after the first commercial sale.  Either party may terminate the agreement in its entirety for bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party and in its entirety or with respect to specific territories for an uncured material breach by the other party, and AbbVie may terminate the agreement in its entirety for specified reasons for cause and in its entirety or with respect to specified territories at will upon advance written notice.  In the event of any termination of the agreement by us for AbbVie’s breach or by AbbVie for cause or at will, AbbVie will license to us certain intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize bardoxolone methyl, transfer and assign to us the regulatory filings for bardoxolone methyl and will assign or license us the relevant trademarks used with the products in their respective territories.  Under certain terminations under the AbbVie license agreement, we are also obligated to pay reverse royalties on net sales of bardoxolone methyl in the terminated territory.
 AbbVie Collaboration Agreement
 In December 2011, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AbbVie under which we provided AbbVie the right to jointly research, develop, and commercialize all second- and later-generation Nrf2 activators for all indications other than renal, cardiovascular, and metabolic indications.  This is a multi-molecule, multi-product collaboration across all indications, other than renal, cardiovascular, and metabolic indications that are covered in our bardoxolone methyl license agreement with AbbVie and our agreement with KHK.  Pursuant to the AbbVie collaboration agreement, the parties have agreed to spend up to a certain amount in early development costs which include research, preclinical development and clinical development, with us paying 100% of a certain amount of such costs and the remaining costs being shared equally.  For jointly developed products, all other worldwide costs are split equally and worldwide profits are also split equally except for any product designated for an indication for which Humira®, a drug marketed and sold by AbbVie, has received regulatory approval in the United States, the European Union, or Japan, in which case the costs and profits will be assumed 70% by AbbVie and 30% by us.  Multiple indications can be developed for a single molecule subject to certain limitations.  Upon conclusion of a Phase 2 trial for a given molecule in a given indication, either party may nominate the molecule as a product candidate, as defined in the agreement specifying the lead indication to advance for a given molecule.
 Jointly developed products are developed under agreed development plans and budgets and both parties are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform their respective obligations under such plans.  With respect to omaveloxolone, we are the lead development party and the lead regulatory party globally.  Manufacturing responsibilities during development are allocated between the parties pursuant to the agreed development plans.  AbbVie will serve as the lead manufacturing party for commercial supply in all jointly developed omaveloxolone indications.
 With respect to joint development, commercialization territory rights are divided on a molecule-by-molecule basis.  We have the primary right to commercialize omaveloxolone in the United States, and AbbVie has the primary right to commercialize omaveloxolone in the rest of world, with exclusive commercialization rights in Japan.  For subsequent product candidates, we retain the rights to at least one major market, although the first choice alternates between the collaboration parties as each new molecule is commercialized.
 Products may be unilaterally developed by a party with the other party being entitled to opt-out of, and back into, development cost sharing and profit sharing at various stages of development.  The developer would serve as the lead development, regulatory, and manufacturing party.  The developer has the right to commercialize in all territories and must pay a royalty to the nonparticipating party ranging from the low single digits to 20%, depending principally on what stage of development, if any, was funded by the nonparticipating party.  In September 2016, we and AbbVie mutually agreed that we would continue unilateral development of omaveloxolone.  Therefore, AbbVie no longer co-funds the exploratory development costs of this program, but retains the right to opt back in at certain points in development.  Depending upon what point, if any, AbbVie opts back into development, AbbVie may retain its right to commercialize a product outside the United States, or we may be responsible for commercializing the product on a worldwide basis.  Upon opting back in, AbbVie would be required to pay an agreed upon amount of all development costs accumulated up to the point of exercising their opt-in right, after which development costs incurred and product revenue worldwide would be split equally.
 The AbbVie collaboration agreement will continue in effect until both parties mutually agree to terminate the agreement.  Upon any uncured material breach under the AbbVie collaboration agreement with respect to a joint product, the non-breaching party will have the right to continue development of such product at its own cost and maintain all profits from such product unless the breaching party opts-in to continue development and pays a specified opt-in payment.
 Payments to us under this agreement include a $400 million upfront payment that was received upon execution of the AbbVie collaboration agreement, $1.4 million in shared development costs prior to our continuing development of omaveloxolone unilaterally, and potential future payments including development cost reimbursement, profit share, and royalty payments.
 Competition
 Bardoxolone Methyl in Chronic Kidney Disease Caused by Alport Syndrome
 If bardoxolone methyl is approved for the treatment of patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome, it will likely be the first treatment on the market for the indication.  At least one therapy for the treatment of Alport syndrome is currently in clinical development with a Phase 2 injectable product candidate, RG-012, from Regulus Therapeutics.
 20

Omaveloxolone in Friedreich’s Ataxia
If omaveloxolone is approved for the treatment of FA, it has the potential to be the first treatment on the market for this indication, but it currently faces pipeline competition.  Pipeline competition for this orphan disease results in competition for patient recruitment as well as investigators’ time and resources.  Several competitor product candidates are in Phase 1 or 2 clinical development for FA, including TAK831, epicatechin, RT001, and JOT101 from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cardero Therapeutics Inc., Retrotope Inc., and Jupiter Orphan Therapeutics, Inc., respectively.  
Bardoxolone Methyl in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Associated with Connective Tissue Disease
 If bardoxolone methyl is approved for the treatment of patients with PAH for use in conjunction with currently approved therapies, such as ERAs, prostacyclins, and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), inhibitors, it will face competition with those current treatments such as macitentan, marketed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (Actelion) as Opsumit®; riociguat, marketed by Bayer AG (Bayer) as Adempas®; oral treprostinil, marketed by United Therapeutics Corporation as Orenitram™; ambrisentan, marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) as Letairis®; selexipag, marketed by Actelion as Uptravi®; and bosentan, marketed by Actelion as Tracleer®.  Patients with PAH frequently use more than one therapy; however, we may face competition for patients’ willingness and resources to add another clinical therapy.
 We may also face competition from potential new therapies in development.  For example, Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Gilead, Bial-Portela & Ca., SA, and Karos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are actively developing compounds that are attempting to address a problem outside of vasodilation and are to be used or allow use in combination with existing treatments.  Their products appear to be in early clinical development.  We consider these our most direct competitors.
 Manufacture and Supply
 We have historically relied on multiple third-party manufacturers and on our collaborators for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval.  Under unilateral development of our product candidates, we are responsible for manufacturing, and we expect to continue to rely on multiple third-party manufacturers.  We believe there are multiple sources for all of the materials required for the manufacture of our product candidates.  Our manufacturing strategy enables us to more efficiently direct financial resources to the research, development, and commercialization of product candidates rather than diverting resources to internally develop manufacturing facilities.  As our product candidates advance through development, we expect to enter into longer-term commercial supply agreements with key suppliers and manufacturers to fulfill and secure the ongoing and planned preclinical, clinical, and, if our product candidates are approved for marketing, our commercial supply needs for ourselves and our collaborators.
Sales and Marketing
 We currently intend to build the commercial infrastructure in the United States necessary to effectively support the commercialization of all of our product candidates if and when we believe regulatory approval of the first of such product candidates in the United States appears imminent.  Commercial infrastructure for orphan products typically consists of a targeted, specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians supported by sales management, medical liaisons, internal sales support, an internal marketing group, and distribution support.  One challenge unique to commercializing therapies for rare diseases is the difficulty in identifying eligible patients due to the very small and sometimes heterogeneous disease populations.  Our management team is experienced in maximizing patient identification for both clinical development and commercialization purposes in rare diseases.
 Additional capabilities important to the orphan marketplace include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies, and government accounts.  To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that any of our product candidates will be approved.
 Outside of the United States, where appropriate and depending on the terms of our contractual arrangements, we plan, either alone, with our strategic collaborators AbbVie and KHK, or with new collaboration partners, to assist in the commercialization of our products.  In certain instances, we may consider building our own commercial infrastructure.
 Government Regulation 
 The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries.  The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.  Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval may subject an applicant and sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the applicable regulatory authority to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial 
 21

suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
 United States Product Approval Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  Pharmaceutical products are also subject to regulation by other governmental agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Justice.  The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include:

• | Preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted under good laboratory practices (GLPs);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (IND) application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before any human clinical trial commences;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB), or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (GCPs);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The submission to the FDA of an NDA for the applicable small molecule drug product;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA acceptance, review, and approval of the NDA (including the product labeling and package insert); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is made to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain.
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate.  Preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations regarding GLPs.  The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which includes a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy determination.  The IND will become effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the studies as outlined in the IND prior to that time.  In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed.  The IND must become effective before clinical trials may be commenced.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidates to healthy human volunteers or patients with the disease to be treated under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator.  Clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified principal investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial, and in accordance with protocols detailing the objectives of the applicable phase of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.  Progress reports detailing the status of clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually.  Sponsors must also report in a timely manner to the FDA SAEs and unexpected AEs, any clinically important increase in the rate of serious suspected adverse events over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure, or any findings from other studies or tests that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate.  Further, the protocol for each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB, either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted.  The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, and the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution.
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, but the phases may overlap or be combined and different studies may be initiated with the same drug candidate within the same phase of development in similar or different patient populations.  These phases generally include the following:
 Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials represent the initial introduction of a product candidate into human subjects, frequently healthy volunteers.  In Phase 1, the product candidate is usually tested for pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties such as safety (including adverse effects), dosage tolerability, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.
 Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve a limited patient population to (1) preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific indications, (2) determine dosage tolerability and optimal dosage, and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
 22

Phase 3. If a product candidate is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 trials, the clinical trial program may be expanded to Phase 3 clinical trials to further evaluate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage, and safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
 Phase 4. Phase 4 clinical trials may be conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations, or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of post-market requirements or commitments.  Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval.
 Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, the manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access.
 A pivotal trial is an adequate and well-controlled clinical trial that permits FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for labeling of the drug.  In most cases FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug.  A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.  The FDA may accept results from Phase 2 trials as pivotal if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust.
 The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.  Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee.  This group determines whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.  A clinical trial sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate.
 The clinical trial process can take three to ten years or more to complete, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product.
 The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacture, composition, and quality of the product candidate, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product.  The application must be accompanied by a significant user fee payment, currently $2.4 million for fiscal year 2018.  The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or decide that the data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical, or other studies.
 Review of Application
 Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, 60 days after submission, the FDA informs the applicant of the specific date by which the FDA intends to complete its review.  This is typically 12 months from the date of submission.  The review process is often extended by the FDA as a result of submission of additional information, sometimes at the FDA’s request, during the review.  The FDA reviews NDAs to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with CGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity.  Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facility complies with CGMPs.  The FDA will also inspect clinical trial sites for integrity of data supporting safety and efficacy.  During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the product.  If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the application without an approved REMS, if required.  A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval.  The FDA may also convene an advisory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review issues relating to risk, benefit, and interpretation of clinical trial data.  The FDA may delay approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or the FDA requires additional testing or information.  The FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.  The FDA will issue either an approval of the NDA or a Complete Response Letter detailing the deficiencies and information required for reconsideration of the application.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA regulated products are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information.  Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration.  Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion.  Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial.  Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
 23

The Orphan Drug Act
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.  Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA.  After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.  Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.  The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication.  During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity.  Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.  Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
 Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity in an indication, if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA in what is known as a Written Request, relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children.  The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
 To receive the six-month pediatric market exclusivity, a sponsor would have to receive a Written Request from the FDA and conduct the requested studies in accordance with a written agreement with the FDA.  If there is no written agreement, studies would be conducted in accordance with commonly accepted scientific principles, and reports submitted of those studies.  A Written Request may include studies for indications that are not currently in the labeling if the FDA determines that such information will benefit the public health.  The FDA will accept the reports upon its determination that the studies were conducted in accordance with and are responsive to the original Written Request, agreement, or commonly accepted scientific principles, as appropriate, and that the reports comply with the FDA’s filing requirements.
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration.  Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver.  The required assessment must include the evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.  The FDA, on its own initiative or at the request of the sponsor, may defer pediatric trial requirements for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations.  A deferral may be granted by the FDA if it believes that additional safety or effectiveness data in the adult population need to be collected before the pediatric studies begin.  The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current, or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 The FDA is required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.  Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate.  The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of NDAs.  For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that has potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition.  The key benefits of fast track designation are rolling review (submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted), and accelerated approval or approval on the basis of a surrogate endpoint, if relevant criteria are met.
 Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve an NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.  Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit.
 24

Based on results of the Phase 3 clinical trial(s) submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at eight months after the NDA submission.  Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition.  If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of twelve months after NDA submission.  Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Even after approval, drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuous regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product.  After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval.  There also are continuing annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA.  For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with CGMP requirements.  Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented.  FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from CGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use.  Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain CGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.  Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may also result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program.  Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary product recalls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fines, untitled and warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of drug products that are placed on the market.  Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.  The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Prescription Drug Marketing Act and Drug Supply Chain Security Act
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors at the state level.  Under the PDMA and state law, states require the registration of manufacturers and distributors who provide pharmaceuticals in that state, including in certain states manufacturers and distributors that ship pharmaceuticals into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state.  The PDMA and state laws impose requirements and limitations upon drug sampling to ensure accountability in the distribution of samples.  The PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of these and other provisions.
 The federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), signed in to law on November 27, 2013, imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing, identification, verification, and other elements.  Among the requirements of this federal legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug 
 25

product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier (i.e., serialization) in order to establish an electronic interoperable prescription product system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States, and keep certain records regarding the drug product.  Further, under this legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.  These requirements are being phased in over a ten-year period.  The DSCSA replaced the prior drug “pedigree” requirements under the PDMA, and preempts existing state drug pedigree laws and regulations.  The DSCSA also establishes new requirements for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third-party logistic providers.  These licensing requirements preempt states from imposing licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or otherwise encompassed by standards established by FDA pursuant to the DSCSA.  Until FDA promulgates regulations to address the DSCSA’s new national licensing standard, current state licensing requirements typically remain in effect.
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws and Regulations
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict certain business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry.  These laws include, but are not limited to, anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency statutes and regulations.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item, or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs.  The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests, and providing anything at less than its fair market value.  The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to certain arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other.  Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for a statutory exception or safe harbor protection.  Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.  Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.  Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.  Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.  The intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the PPACA) to a lower intent standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or the specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.  In addition, the PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below).  Further, civil monetary penalties statutes impose penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 The federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government.  As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government.  Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product.  Other pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.  The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services.  Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the PPACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.  HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements on certain types of entities relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information.  Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity.  HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make 
 26

civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.  In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the PPACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) annually report information to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 Also, many states have similar healthcare statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer.  Some states require the posting of information relating to clinical trials.  Other states require the reporting of expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and the reporting of gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states.  Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals.  Still other states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justification of price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging.  In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.  To the extent that any of our products will be sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement
 In both domestic and foreign markets, our sales of any approved products will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers.  Third-party payers include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations.  Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs.
 Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.  Sales of our products will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by third-party payers.  These third-party payers are increasingly focused on containing healthcare costs by challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services.  In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare product candidates.  The market for our products and product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payers’ drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payers provide coverage and reimbursement.  The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies.  Also, third-party payers may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available.
 Because each third-party payer individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming, costly, and sometimes unpredictable process.  We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payer separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products.  This process could delay the market acceptance of any product and could have a negative effect on our future revenue and operating results.  We cannot be certain that our products and our product candidates will be considered cost-effective.  Because coverage and reimbursement determinations are made on a payer-by-payer basis, obtaining acceptable coverage and reimbursement from one payer does not guarantee that we will obtain similar acceptable coverage or reimbursement from another payer.  If we are unable to obtain coverage of, and adequate reimbursement and payment levels for, our product candidates from third-party payers, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them.  This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and adversely affect our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
 In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union and China, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control.  In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.  The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.  For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to 
 27

control the prices of medicinal products for human use.  A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of a company placing the medicinal product on the market.  We may face competition for our product candidates from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products.  In addition, there may be importation of foreign products that compete with our own products, which could adversely affect our profitability.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations as we begin to commercialize our products.  In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state level that seek to reduce healthcare costs.
 Furthermore, political, economic, and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental change.  Initiatives to reduce the federal budget and debt and to reform healthcare coverage are increasing cost-containment efforts.  We anticipate that Congress, state legislatures, and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare benefits, controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and Medicare and Medicaid spending, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, price controls on pharmaceuticals, and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system.  Any proposed or actual changes could limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability.  For example, in March 2010, the PPACA was signed into law.  Among other cost containment measures, the PPACA established: an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; and extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations.  The PPACA also expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs, created a new Medicare Part D discount program, expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Services Pharmaceutical pricing program, and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.  In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products, or which could otherwise affect our commercial operations and ability to be profitable.  If future legislation were to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions, it could have a significant adverse effect on our business.  Managed care organizations, as well as Medicaid and other government agencies, continue to seek price discounts.  Some states have implemented, and other states are considering, price controls or patient access constraints under the Medicaid program, and some states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible.  More recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the 2017 Tax Act) was signed into law, which eliminated certain requirements of the ACA, including the individual mandate, and the current administration has further suggested that it may seek repeal of all or portions of the PPACA.  There is uncertainty with respect to the impact these changes, if any, may have, and any changes likely will take time to unfold.
 In addition, on August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted and created measures for spending reductions by Congress.  A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs.  These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013.  These reductions have been extended through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken.  Also, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed in to law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of health care providers.
 Due to the volatility in the current economic and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the effect of any unforeseen or unknown legislative, regulatory, payer, or policy actions, which may include cost containment and healthcare reform measures.  Such policy actions could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
 New Legislation and Regulations
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced, and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.  For example, the 21st Century Cures Act, which was enacted on December 13, 2016, contains a number of provisions related to the development of drug and biological products, including provisions intended to encourage the modernization of clinical trial design and support broader use of tools like biomarkers and methods to collect patient experience data.  While the 21st Century Cures Act is intended to make drug and biological product development less time-consuming and less costly, it does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality or quantity of evidence necessary to support approval.  In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Act of 2017 reauthorized and amended several drug provisions that were scheduled to sunset, such as the prescription drug user fee provisions, and made other changes to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including provisions related to development of pediatric drugs and access to generic drugs.  In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.  It is impossible to 
 28

predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies, or interpretations changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
 Foreign Regulation
 We are planning on seeking approval for our product candidates in Europe, Japan, and other countries.  To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy that govern, among other things, clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of our products.  Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions.  Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of other countries in which we may seek approval, the approval process varies among countries and jurisdictions and can involve different amounts of product testing and additional administrative review periods.  For example, in Europe, a sponsor must submit a clinical trial application (CTA), much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials.  A CTA must be submitted to each national health authority and an independent ethics committee.
 For other countries outside of the European Union, such as the countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country.  The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from or be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval.  Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively affect the regulatory approval process in other countries.
 United States Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products
 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process.  The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an initial IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of the NDA and the approval of that product candidate application.  Patent term restoration cannot, however, extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date.  In addition, only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for any patent term extension or restoration.  In the future, we expect to apply for restoration of patent term for patents relating to each of our product candidates to add patent life beyond the current expiration date of such patents, depending on the length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 Market exclusivity provisions under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of companies seeking to reference another company’s NDA.  For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides a five-year period of exclusivity to any approved NDA for a product containing a new chemical entity (NCE), never previously approved by FDA either alone or in combination with another active moiety.  No application or abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), that references the NDA for the NCE may be submitted during the five-year exclusivity period, except that such applications may be submitted after four years if they contain a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement of the patents listed with the FDA for the innovator NDA.
 Foreign Country Data Exclusivity
 The European Union also provides opportunities for additional market exclusivity.  For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, an NCE generally receives eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity.  If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application.  During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity.
Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for our product candidates including patents claiming compositions of matter, therapeutic uses, distinct forms of specific compounds, formulations, manufacturing methods, and uses in specific indications and patient populations.  We are actively engaged in research to further develop and maintain our competitive position, and may rely in part on trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and continuous technological innovation to support and enhance our competitive position.
 We seek to protect and strengthen our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technologies, inventions, and any improvements that we consider important to the development and implementation of our business and strategy.  Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our products and technologies will depend, in 
 29

part, on our success in obtaining and enforcing valid patent claims.  Additionally, we may benefit from a variety of regulatory frameworks in the United States, Europe, Japan, China, and other territories that provide periods of non-patent-based exclusivity for qualifying drug products.  See “Business—Government Regulation—United States Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products.”
 We cannot ensure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications that may be filed by us in the future, nor can we ensure that any of our existing or subsequently granted patents will be useful in protecting our drug candidates, technological innovations, or processes.  Additionally, any existing or subsequently granted patents may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or infringed.  We cannot guarantee that our intellectual property rights or proprietary position will be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide or protect competitive advantages.  Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar products, or may be able to duplicate our technologies, business model, or strategy, without infringing our patents or otherwise using our intellectual property.
 Our patent estate (patents and patent applications owned by or exclusively licensed to Reata and one family of patent applications owned by AbbVie and contractually available for Reata’s use), on a worldwide basis, encompasses more than 240 granted patents and more than 280 pending patent applications, including more than 140 granted patents and more than 150 pending patent applications related to bardoxolone methyl, omaveloxolone, RTA 901, and RTA 1701.  More than 60 granted patents and more than 100 pending applications claim additional structural classes of Nrf2 activators, providing further protection for the franchise and a potential source of additional development candidates.  One issued United States patent, one issued foreign patent, a pending United States patent application, and eleven pending foreign patent applications contain composition of matter claims to RTA 901 and related compounds.  RTA 1701 is covered by more than 20 granted U.S. and foreign patents, and a number of pending applications.
 Our later-expiring granted patents with claims to compositions of matter for bardoxolone methyl, including patents claiming the commercial form, have an expiration date of 2029 in the United States and 2028 elsewhere.  The patent that covers specific formulations of bardoxolone methyl, including the commercial formulation, has an expiration date of 2030.  Other granted patents and pending patent applications relating to specific uses of bardoxolone methyl, including the treatment of PH, PAH, and CKD, have expiration dates ranging from 2029 to 2034.  Fundamental composition of matter patents and applications claiming omaveloxolone have an expiration date in 2033.  These patents and applications also contain claims to therapeutic uses of omaveloxolone.  The fundamental United States composition of matter patent claiming RTA 901, and its foreign equivalents, have an expiration date in 2033.  Patents and pending applications covering RTA 1701, including composition of matter claims and method of use claims, have expiration dates ranging from 2031 to 2037.
 The protection afforded by any particular patent depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, scope of coverage encompassed by the granted claims, availability of extensions of patent term, availability of legal remedies in the particular territory in which the patent is granted, and success of any challenges to the patent, if asserted.  Changes in either patent laws or in the interpretation of patent laws in the United States and other countries could diminish our ability to protect our inventions and to enforce our intellectual property rights.  Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty the enforceability of any granted patent claims or of any claims that may be granted from our patent applications.
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.  Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our products and core technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted.  We have in the past been involved in various administrative proceedings with respect to our patents and patent applications and may, as a result of our extensive portfolio, be involved in such proceedings in the future.  Additionally, in the future, we may claim that a third party infringes our intellectual property or a third party may claim that we infringe its intellectual property or that our intellectual property is invalid or unenforceable.  In any of the administrative proceedings or in litigation, we may incur significant expenses, damages, attorneys’ fees, costs of proceedings and experts’ fees, and management and employees may be required to spend significant time in connection with these actions.
 Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that any patent related to our product candidates may expire before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, or may remain in force for only a short period of time following commercialization, thereby reducing the advantage afforded by any such patent.
 The patent positions for our most advanced programs are summarized below.
 Bardoxolone Methyl Patent Portfolio
 Our bardoxolone methyl patent portfolio includes five families of granted United States patents, some with related applications pending, and two additional families of pending United States patent applications.  Granted and pending claims offer various forms of protection for bardoxolone methyl including claims to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, specific forms (such as crystalline or non-crystalline forms), specific formulations, and methods for treating a variety of diseases, including PAH and CKD, using bardoxolone methyl or its analogs.  These United States patents and applications, and their foreign equivalents, are described in more detail below.
 30

There are two families of composition of matter patents containing claims for bardoxolone methyl.  The original patent family containing claims to bardoxolone methyl and related compounds was filed in 1999 and exclusively licensed to Reata in 2004 (see “Business—Intellectual Property—Licenses”).  Exclusive of any patent term extension, one granted United States patent from this family containing claims covering bardoxolone methyl has an expiration date in 2022.  Corresponding patents granted in Canada, Europe (validated in multiple European Patent Convention member states), and Japan have expiration dates in 2019.  Exclusive of any patent term extension, the granted United States patents containing claims covering specific forms of bardoxolone methyl, including the commercial form, are due to expire in 2028 or 2029.  Two corresponding regional patents have been granted in Europe and each is validated in multiple European Patent Convention member states.  Additional corresponding patents have been granted in Japan, China, Canada, and several other countries, and related applications provide broad international protection in additional territories worldwide.  Exclusive of any patent term extension, these granted foreign patents and pending patent applications, if granted, are due to expire in 2028.
 In some cases, granted United States patents claiming bardoxolone methyl have a longer statutory term than the corresponding foreign patents.  This results from the USPTO’s practice of granting patent term adjustments for examination delays originating at the USPTO.  Such adjustments are generally not available under foreign patent laws.  If bardoxolone methyl is approved for marketing in the United States, under the Hatch-Waxman Act we may be eligible for up to five years patent term extension for a granted United States patent containing claims covering bardoxolone methyl.  Similar term extensions may be available in Europe, Japan, Australia, and certain other foreign jurisdictions.  The amount of any such term extension, and the identity of the patent to which it would apply, are dependent upon several factors including the duration of the development program and the date of marketing approval.  See “Business—Government Regulation—United States Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products.”
 We also own or exclusively license various United States and foreign granted patents and pending patent applications containing claims covering formulations of bardoxolone methyl, including the planned commercial formulation, and methods of using bardoxolone methyl for the treatment of multiple diseases including PH, PAH, endothelial dysfunction (an essential component of many cardiovascular disorders including PAH), cardiovascular disease, CKD, metabolic disorders, and obesity.
 The most relevant granted United States patents with composition of matter or method of use claims covering bardoxolone methyl are listed below, along with their projected expiration dates exclusive of any patent term extension.

This family includes four issued United States patents and a number of granted patents in foreign jurisdictions including China, Mexico, and Japan.  Additional United States and foreign applications from this family are pending.  The second family, filed in April 2013, is specifically focused on omaveloxolone and includes composition of matter claims and method of use claims.  The initial United States patent from this family was issued on March 31, 2015.  The issued claims include composition of matter claims to omaveloxolone without regard to morphic form, claims to several distinct morphic forms of omaveloxolone including the form used in oral dosing formulations, and claims to various methods of therapeutic use.  A first continuation application has also issued, and a second continuation application is pending.  Foreign equivalents of the original U.S. application have been filed in Europe, Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, and more than 20 other territories.  The European application has granted and has been validated in multiple European Patent Convention member states.  In addition, a divisional application has been filed in Europe.  A third patent family, filed by AbbVie in April 2014 and subject to the terms of the AbbVie collaboration agreement, claims additional morphic forms of omaveloxolone.
 31

The most relevant granted United States patents with claims covering omaveloxolone are listed below, along with their projected expiration dates.  As discussed above for bardoxolone methyl, if omaveloxolone is approved for marketing in the United States, we may be eligible for term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act for a granted United States patent containing claims covering omaveloxolone.  Similar term extensions may be available in Europe, Japan, and certain other foreign jurisdictions.  The amount of any such term extension, and the identity of the patent to which it would apply, are dependent upon several factors including the duration of the development program and the date of marketing approval.  See “Government Regulation—United States Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products.”

Trade Secrets and Know-How
 Certain aspects of our activities, such as our research and manufacturing efforts, rely in part on proprietary know-how or trade secrets.  Because we may employ third-party contractors to conduct certain aspects of those activities and because we collaborate with various organizations and academic institutions on the advancement of our technology platform, we must at times share trade secrets with them.  We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, collaborative research agreements, consulting agreements, or other similar agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees, and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information.  These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, such as trade secrets.  Despite these contractual provisions, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements.  Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor’s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.  We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
 Licenses
 2004 Dartmouth and MD Anderson License
 In 2004, we entered into an agreement with the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System in which we obtained from The Trustees of Dartmouth College (Dartmouth) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson), an exclusive, sublicenseable, worldwide license to compounds, including bardoxolone methyl, and claims in certain patents and patent applications, along with associated know-how, to manufacture, have manufactured, use and sell defined licensed products for use within the field of human 
 32

therapeutic and diagnostic uses, research reagents and veterinary uses.  Dartmouth and MD Anderson retain certain limited rights related to academic research and educational use of these compounds, and the U.S. government retains certain limited rights.
 Under the terms of this license, we paid an initial licensing fee and sunk-in patent costs and are required to pay annual license maintenance fees.  In addition, the license requires us to make certain development milestone payments depending on the licensed indication, a portion of sublicensing revenue received by us from sublicenses that we grant under the licensed technology at percentages between mid-teen digits and low-single digits, and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of licensed products by us, our affiliates, and our sublicensees subject to specified annual minimums.  To date, we have made $25.2 million in development and sublicense payments under the license.
 We have a continuing obligation to use best efforts to commercialize the licensed technology.  The license is effective until the last expiration of a claim in a licensed patent that covers the licensed product or 20 years if no licensed patent covers the licensed product.  The license can be terminated by the licensors for our material breach subject to a specified notice and cure period based on the nature of the breach, if we become insolvent or enter bankruptcy or receivership proceedings, if we fail to provide satisfactory evidence that we are exercising best efforts to commercialize a licensed invention, or if two payments are late or unpaid within a twelve-month period.  Upon any termination of the license, we grant licensors a non-exclusive, sublicenseable license to any improvements that we make to the licensed technology, including those that we license from third parties, subject to a mutually agreed royalty.
 2012 Amendment to the 2004 Dartmouth and MD Anderson License
 In July 2012, the parties executed an amendment to the 2004 license.  This amendment provides, among other terms, that we will pay to the licensors a certain amount from the next one or more milestone payments received by us under the AbbVie license agreement and a low single-digit royalty on net sales of certain Nrf2 activator compounds under the AbbVie collaboration agreement, including omaveloxolone, that are claimed in certain patents and patent applications that are wholly owned by or assigned to us as identified in the AbbVie collaboration agreement.
 2009 Dartmouth License
 In 2009, we entered into an agreement with Dartmouth, pursuant to which Dartmouth granted us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicenseable license to Dartmouth’s rights in patents and patent applications jointly owned by us and Dartmouth claiming the use of bardoxolone methyl and related compounds in the treatment of renal, cardiovascular, and certain metabolic diseases, along with associated know-how, to make, have made, use and sell defined licensed products in the licensed field.  Dartmouth retains certain limited rights related to academic research and educational use of these compounds.
 Under the terms of this license, we paid to Dartmouth an initial licensing fee and we are required to pay annual maintenance fees and payments associated with the achievement of certain development and aggregate sales milestones.  In addition, Dartmouth is entitled to receive from us a portion of our sublicensing revenue from sublicenses that we grant under the licensed technology at a percentage in the low single digits, and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of licensed products by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees.  In July 2012, the parties executed an amendment to the license, which provides, among other terms, that we pay to Dartmouth a sublicensing fee in connection with a specified milestone under the AbbVie license agreement.  To date, we have made $10.2 million in development and sublicense payments under the license.
 We are obligated to exert commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize and effectively manufacture and market licensed products, including, targeting certain development milestones specified in the agreement.
 The license is effective until the last valid claim of the licensed patents in the territory expires.  Each party has the right to terminate the license for the other party’s material breach, subject to a specified notice and cure period.  The license terminates automatically in the event that we become insolvent, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or file for bankruptcy.
 2014 University of Kansas Licenses
 In September 2014, we entered into two exclusive, worldwide license agreements with KU Center for Technology Commercialization, Inc., the manager of intellectual property owned by University of Kansas and the University of Kansas Medical Center (the University of Kansas), to compounds claimed in certain patents and patent applications either owned exclusively by the University of Kansas or owned jointly by the University of Kansas and the National Institutes of Health (the NIH), that act as small molecule modulators of heat shock protein activity and responses in all human and veterinary therapeutic and diagnostic uses.
 Under the terms of these licenses, we paid the University of Kansas initial licensing fees and reimbursed University of Kansas for past patent expenses incurred.  Under each agreement, we are required to pay annual license maintenance fees, are obligated to spend a specified threshold for sponsored research to be performed by the University of Kansas, and are obligated to pay University of Kansas development and regulatory milestone payments for each of the first two products, and sales milestone payments only on the first product developed.  Under each agreement the University of Kansas is entitled to receive from us a portion of any sublicensing revenue we receive from sublicenses that 
 33

we grant under the licensed technology at a percentage ranging from the low single digits to the low thirties depending on the stage of development at the time the sublicense is granted.  Under each agreement, the University of Kansas is entitled to receive royalties on net sales of licensed products sold by us, our affiliates, and our sublicensees at a percentage ranging in the low single digits depending on the type of licensed product, subject to minimum annual royalties.  To date, we have made $0.7 million in development and sublicense payments under these licenses.  Under each license agreement we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, and market at least one licensed compound.  Additionally, under each license agreement, the University of Kansas retains limited rights related to research and educational use of these compounds, and the U.S. government also retains certain limited rights related to these compounds arising from federal funding of the research that led to their discovery.  Under one agreement, the NIH retains limited rights related to research and educational use of compounds claimed in patents that name NIH as an assignee.
 Each license agreement is effective on a per-country basis until the later of: (i) the last expiration of a claim in a licensed patent that covers the licensed product in such country; (ii) ten years from first commercial sale of a licensed product in such country; or (iii) the expiration of any period of regulatory exclusivity for a licensed product that bars the entry of generic competitors in such country.
 Each license agreement can be terminated by the University of Kansas if we fail to make required payments or reports, fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize a licensed product, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, enter into receivership or a composition with creditors, or fail to perform certain other obligations including the achievement of certain developmental milestones within specified time limits, and we fail to cure any such breach within 30 days of receiving a notice of default from the licensors.
 Third-Party Filings
 A number of United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing products.  Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that, if granted, could pose an infringement risk with respect to our use of our product candidates or proprietary technologies.
 If a third party claims that we infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including but not limited to litigation expenses, substantial damages, attorney fees, injunction, royalty payments, cross-licensing of our patents, redesign of our products, or processes and related fees and costs.
 We may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our products, product candidates, and proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights.  If one of these patents were to be found to cover our products, product candidates, proprietary technologies, or their uses, we could be required to pay damages and could be restricted from commercializing our products, product candidates, or using our proprietary technologies unless we obtain a license to the patent.  A license may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.  In addition, during litigation, the patent holder might obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable right, which could prohibit us from making, using or selling our products, technologies, or methods.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 93 full-time employees, 23 of whom held Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 62 of whom were engaged in research and development, and 31 of whom were engaged in business development, finance, information systems, facilities, human resources, legal functions, or administrative support.  None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and none of our employees has entered into a collective agreement with us.  We consider our employee relations to be good.
Research and Development
 In each of the last three fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we have spent $71.3 million, $39.5 million, and $35.1 million, respectively, on research and development.
 Facilities
 Our principal executive offices are located in Irving, Texas, where we lease approximately 34,890 square feet of office and laboratory space.  Our lease expires in October 2020.  We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space would be available if needed.
