General
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in the fields of neurology and psychiatry. We are developing a pipeline of clinical and nonclinical product candidates that focuses on the various aspects of debilitating neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, and other indications in the fields of neurology and psychiatry. Our goal is to be the leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the fields of neurology and psychiatry. 
Our near-term focus is to develop our gene therapy product candidate, AXO-Lenti-PD, as a one-time treatment for Parkinson’s disease. We intend to begin a Phase 1/2 study of AXO-Lenti-PD in advanced Parkinson’s disease patients before the end of 2018. Prior to the recent in-licensing of AXO-Lenti-PD in June 2018, our primary focus had been on developing nelotanserin, a selective inverse agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor, and intepirdine, an antagonist of the 5-HT6 receptor. In January 2018, we announced the results of a pilot Phase 2 study of nelotanserin in patients with Lewy body dementia (“LBD”) that experience visual hallucinations. We plan to make a determination of the overall development strategy for nelotanserin once we have reviewed topline data in the second half of 2018 from our currently ongoing Phase 2 study of nelotanserin in REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (“RBD”) and have completed our ongoing comprehensive clinical, regulatory and commercial review. In addition, we will determine our development plans for RVT-104, a combination of rivastigmine and a peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonist, as a potential treatment for patients with Alzheimer's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies (“DLB”), once we have completed our ongoing comprehensive clinical, regulatory and commercial review in the context of our recent acquisition of AXO-Lenti-PD and any newly acquired assets. 
In January 2018, we announced the discontinuation of our development of intepirdine following our announcement that neither the Phase 2b HEADWAY clinical trial of intepirdine in patients with DLB nor the pilot Phase 2 Gait and Balance clinical trial of intepirdine in patients with dementia and gait impairment met their respective primary endpoints, and the September 2017 announcement that our Phase 3 MINDSET clinical trial of intepirdine in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease did not meet its co-primary efficacy endpoints. Following the announcement of Phase 3 MINDSET clinical trial results, we also discontinued further development of RVT-103 which had been intended for use in combination with intepirdine. We remain committed to identifying, developing and commercializing other novel treatments for unmet needs in neurology and psychiatry. We are continuing to actively explore opportunities to acquire or in-license additional products, product candidates and technologies to further build our pipeline. 
AXO-Lenti-PD
Overview
AXO-Lenti-PD (previously known as OXB-102) is an in vivo lentiviral gene therapy investigational product candidate currently being developed for the one-time treatment of Parkinson’s disease. We licensed the worldwide development and commercialization rights to AXO-Lenti-PD and its predecessor product ProSavin, from Oxford BioMedica (UK) Ltd. (“Oxford BioMedica”), under an exclusive license agreement (the “Oxford BioMedica Agreement”) entered into in June 2018. 
5

AXO-Lenti-PD delivers a construct of three genes that encode the critical enzymes required for the biochemical synthesis of endogenous dopamine from tyrosine. The three enzymes are: Tyrosine Hydroxylase (“TH”, the enzyme that converts tyrosine to L-dopa), Cyclohydrolase 1 (“CH1”, the rate-limiting enzyme for synthesis of Tetrahydrobiopterin (“BH4”), a critical cofactor for production of L-dopa), and Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase (“AADC”, the enzyme that converts L-dopa to dopamine). AXO-Lenti-PD is delivered by a one-time MRI-guided stereotactic infusion into the putamen. We believe that delivery of all three of these genes will enable the continuous, tonic, endogenous synthesis of dopamine in non-dopaminergic cells. Dopamine deficiency plays a central role in Parkinson’s disease and we believe that restoring dopamine synthesis capability in patients will offer lasting improvement in the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Oxford BioMedica previously conducted a Phase 1/2 clinical study with ProSavin (also known as OXB-101), an earlier version of this product candidate. In this clinical trial, ProSavin was observed to have a favorable long-term safety profile and demonstrated effects on motor function, supporting proof-of-concept. AXO-Lenti-PD delivers an optimized transgene construct relative to ProSavin.
Theoretical Benefit of AXO-Lenti PD on Dopamine Concentrations Based on Postulated Mechanism of Action
Parkinson’s Disease Overview
Parkinson’s disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that primarily results in progressive and debilitating motor symptoms. It is estimated that up to 1,000,000 people in the United States and 7,000,000 to 10,000,000 people worldwide suffer from Parkinson’s disease. It typically develops between the ages of 55 and 65 years and affects approximately 1% of people over 60 years of age. The underlying factors that result in the development of Parkinson’s disease are largely unknown. However, Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease that results in reduced levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the striatum, a region in the brain. Dopamine is essential for movement, and low levels of dopamine in patients with Parkinson’s disease are believed to result in the typical motor symptoms of the disease, including hypo- and bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability.
The treatment of Parkinson’s disease is currently limited to symptomatic treatments, as no therapies have proven effective in altering the course of the disease or addressing the underlying pathophysiological processes. The mainstay of treatment typically involves the daily administration of oral L-dopa, the precursor to dopamine. While L-dopa is effective in controlling motor symptoms early in the disease, progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons and chronic L-dopa therapy are believed to contribute to the “wearing off’ of L-dopa’s efficacy in the more advanced stages of the disease. Patients become increasingly less responsive to oral L-dopa therapy and require higher doses to manage their symptoms. More advanced Parkinson’s disease patients often begin to experience ‘on-off’ motor fluctuations, characterized by unpredictable ‘OFF periods’ of reduced mobility and increased rigidity and tremor. In addition, abnormal and involuntary movements known as dyskinesias may occur at higher L-dopa blood levels. Approximately 10% of patients per year develop ‘on-off’ motor fluctuations after starting L-dopa therapy. 
6

As Parkinson’s disease progresses, other therapies can be given in combination with L-dopa and include dopamine receptor agonists and inhibitors of enzymes related to dopamine metabolism, such as monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) and catechol O-methyl transferase (COMT). These therapies aim to further improve overall dopaminergic function. Patient-friendly treatment options for motor fluctuations in advanced Parkinson’s disease are limited. Subcutaneous injections of the dopamine agonist apomorphine are used for the acute treatment of OFF episodes. Duopa/Duodopa is an enteral suspension of L-dopa and the peripheral AADC inhibitor carbidopa that is continuously administered over the course of the day through a surgically-placed percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with jejunal tube (“PEG-J”) to reduce fluctuations in L-dopa blood levels. Deep-Brain Stimulation (“DBS”), a procedure in which electrodes are surgically placed in the basal ganglia, either in the subthalamic nucleus or internal globus pallidus, is another option in advanced Parkinson’s disease. Through an impulse generator, electrical stimuli are delivered to the brain to modulate neural signals within these target regions. It remains unclear exactly how DBS improves the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Both Duopa/Duodopa and DBS require indwelling hardware - a PEG-J tube, or electrodes, leads, and impulse generator - respectively. 
Predecessor Product: ProSavin (OXB-101)
ProSavin, the predecessor therapy to AXO-Lenti-PD, delivered the same three genes (AADC, TH, and CH1) as AXO-Lenti-PD in the same lentiviral vector, but in a different payload configuration. AXO-Lenti-PD was the result of multifactorial experimentation to modify the payload configuration to improve endogenous dopamine production. The initial Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ProSavin was completed in 2012 and long-term follow-up is ongoing.
Nonclinical Studies for ProSavin
Nonclinical studies in non-human primate models of Parkinson’s disease demonstrated that ProSavin can safely restore striatal dopamine production to approximately 50% and correct motor deficits without associated dyskinesias (p-value <0.05). ProSavin was observed to improve Parkinson’s disease symptoms and clinical disease severity in the same non-human primate model, with a durable response seen up to 12 months (p-value < 0.05 at all time points beyond week 4). One of the ProSavin treated non-human primates was continued on the study and exhibited a sustained motor improvement until the study was concluded at 44 months. Nonclinical study data did not reveal adverse reactions nor findings with potential impact on patient safety and provided pertinent data on the optimal method of delivery in the clinic. ProSavin was also observed to be well tolerated when co-administered with L-dopa and apomorphine, indicating that it can be used in conjunction with these commonly used Parkinson’s disease medications.
Behavioral Response and Dopamine Production Following Administration of ProSavin in Non-Human Primates
In summary, these experiments were determined to demonstrate the long-term safety of therapeutic doses of ProSavin as well as significant efficacy to improve measures of movement and reduce dyskinesias in multiple animal models. These results supported the initiation of clinical trials for ProSavin.
7

Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of ProSavin
ProSavin was evaluated for safety and efficacy in a Phase 1/2 study in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease by Oxford BioMedica. In this study, ProSavin was observed to be safe and well-tolerated with sustained improvements on motor function as measured by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (“UPDRS”) Part III (motor) score in the state “OFF” levodopa medication (“UPDRS Part III “OFF””). The Phase 1/2 clinical trial was conducted at sites in the United Kingdom and France on a total of 15 patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease. Three dose levels of ProSavin were assessed in four patient cohorts: dose level one (1.9 × 107 transducing units (“TU”); cohort 1); dose level two (4.0 × 107 TU; cohorts 2a and 2b); and dose level three (1 × 108 TU; cohort 3). Cohorts 2b and 3 underwent a modified delivery method to increase the rate of delivery of the viral vector. The primary endpoints were the number and severity of adverse events as well as the UPDRS Part III “OFF” scores at 6 months after gene therapy administration. No serious adverse events related to ProSavin or the surgical procedure were reported. Reported adverse events (“AEs”) were generally mild and related to either Parkinson’s disease progression or L-dopa-induced dyskinesias that were ameliorated with reduction of L-dopa administration. The most common AEs in the first 12 months were dyskinesia (n=11 subjects), “on-off” motor fluctuations (n=9), headache (n=4), and akinesia (n=3). 
Across all patients, mean UPDRS Part III “OFF” scores were significantly improved at six months (33% reduction, p-value=0.0001) and 12 months (31% reduction, p-value=0.0001). Sustained improvement was seen through four years of follow-up and the long-term follow-up study is still ongoing (10 years exposure in the earliest subject). This clinical data was published in The Lancet in 2014.
Mean change in UPDRS Part III “OFF” score results after 12 months from the Phase 1/2 ProSavin Trial 
Second-Generation Product Candidate: AXO-Lenti-PD
AXO-Lenti-PD is a re-engineered gene therapy product candidate that was selected following multifactorial experimentation to modify the payload configuration of ProSavin to further improve dopamine production. The modifications included a different ordering of the genes, the fusion of TH and CH1 with a flexible linker, and the removal of a genetic control element between TH and AADC. We believe these changes lead to more balanced stoichiometry of gene expression and colocalization of enzymatic activity. The targeted net result is improved dopamine production in transfected cells.
Nonclinical studies for AXO-Lenti-PD
In vitro experiments with AXO-Lenti-PD demonstrated up to 10-fold increases in dopamine + L-dopa production over ProSavin. Functionally, in non-human primate models, AXO-Lenti-PD demonstrated a similar level of improvement in spontaneous locomotor activity compared to ProSavin at approximately 1/5th the dose. We believe these data demonstrate that AXO-Lenti-PD has greater potency compared to ProSavin in terms of dopamine production, enzymatic activity and functional improvement in animal models of Parkinson’s disease.

Planned Phase 1/2 Clinical Study of AXO-Lenti-PD
We plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical study of AXO-Lenti-PD in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease before the end of 2018. The planned study design consists of two parts:

• | Part A is a non-randomized dose-escalation of multiple potential dose levels


• | Part B is a double-blind design with patients randomized either to an active group receiving the optimal dose as determined in Part A, or a control group receiving an imitation “sham” surgical procedure

The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of AXO-Lenti-PD as well as effects on biomarkers and clinical measures of motor function, including as measured by the UPDRS Part III. Sufficient gene therapy product is currently available to complete the planned Phase 1/2 clinical study.

Nelotanserin
Overview
In October 2015, we acquired from our majority shareholder, Roivant Sciences Ltd. (“RSL”), the global rights to nelotanserin, a selective inverse agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor. To date, we have been investigating and developing nelotanserin to address visual hallucinations and REM sleep behavior disorder (“RBD”) in patients with LBD. In June 2017, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for nelotanserin for the treatment of visual hallucinations in DLB.
Mechanism of Action
Nelotanserin reduces the activity of the 5-HT2A receptor. The 5-HT2A receptor has been linked to neuropsychiatric disturbances including visual hallucinations and sleep disturbances and the antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors has been shown to improve parkinsonism. In in vitro studies, nelotanserin did not antagonize the dopamine D2 receptor. Antagonism of the D2 receptor in LBD patients can lead to severe side effects including increased parkinsonism, worsening of cognition, heavy sedation, and symptoms resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which can be fatal.
Nelotanserin in Lewy Body Dementia 
Medical Need
LBD includes two similar conditions, DLB and Parkinson’s disease dementia (“PDD”). There is significant overlap in the pathology and clinical presentation of both conditions; however, the primary difference generally depends on the timing of the onset of cognitive decline relative to the onset of movement-related symptoms. LBD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder pathologically characterized by the aggregation of alpha-synuclein and other proteins, known as Lewy bodies, in the brain, causing disruption in cognition, function and behavior. In DLB, the cognitive decline typically occurs before or within one year of the onset of movement disorder symptoms. In PDD, movement disorder symptoms typically precede cognitive decline by more than one year. The Lewy Body Dementia Association estimates that there are 1.4 million patients with LBD in the United States.
LBD patients suffer from frequent visual hallucinations, which are often treated with off-label atypical antipsychotic medications, such as quetiapine. Use of atypical antipsychotic medications, which have activity against the dopamine D2 receptor, can lead to increased or possibly irreversible parkinsonism in LBD patients and a life-threatening side-effect resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome. We believe that there is a need for new therapeutic options that can reduce visual hallucinations in LBD patients without risk of these severe side effects.
Parkinsonism is a core feature of LBD, which includes patients diagnosed with both PDD and DLB. Dopaminergic agents (such as L-Dopa and dopamine agonists), which are commonly used for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, can exacerbate neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients diagnosed with LBD. We believe that there is a need for new therapeutic options for LBD patients that can reduce the burden of motor symptoms without increasing the risk of neuropsychiatric side-effects.
Clinical Development
In January 2018, we reported results for a pilot Phase 2 Visual Hallucination study of nelotanserin in patients with LBD. On the primary endpoint of safety, including an assessment of symptoms as measured by the UPDRS, nelotanserin was generally well tolerated. A number of exploratory efficacy assessments were conducted, including the UPDRS Part III; the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS); SAPS-PD; the Patient Global Impression of Change of Visual Hallucinations (PGIC-VH); and an internally developed patient diary. In a prespecified intention-to-treat analysis, nelotanserin treatment versus placebo (n=27) resulted in a 3.12 point improvement in the UPDRS Part III with a positive trend (p=0.075, unadjusted). In a prespecified analysis of the DLB patient subset (n=19), nelotanserin improved the UPDRS Part III by 4.00 points (p=0.041, unadjusted). No other statistical trends of improvement were seen on prespecified analyses of the full SAPS, SAPS-PD, PGIC-VH, or in the patient diary. We plan to make a determination of the overall development strategy for nelotanserin once the results from the Phase 2 RBD study of nelotanserin are received in the second half of 2018 and after we complete our ongoing comprehensive clinical, regulatory and commercial review in the context of any newly acquired product candidates.

Nelotanserin for REM Sleep Behavior Disorder in Lewy Body Dementia 
Medical Need
RBD is a common clinical feature of LBD, and is a condition where patients lose normal sleep paralysis resulting in the physical acting out of their dreams, impacting their quality of life and endangering themselves and their bed partners. While off-label treatment of RBD with benzodiazepines is common, this class of drugs is associated with severe side effects in patients with dementia, including sedation, worsening of cognition and increased risk of falls. We believe that there is a need for new therapeutic options that can reduce the frequency of RBD without sedating patients or worsening cognition in patients with dementia.
Clinical Development
In March 2016, we initiated a four-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in patients with DLB and Parkinson's disease dementia suffering from RBD. This study will utilize objective measures of efficacy as assessed in a sleep-lab setting. Due to challenges with recruitment for this study, we elected to close enrollment prior to reaching our enrollment target. Because of this smaller than planned enrollment, the study may not qualify as pivotal. We expect to receive top-line results for this study in the second half of calendar year 2018. Patients completing the double-blind portion of this study are eligible to enroll in an open label extension study of nelotanserin.
RVT-104
Overview
In August 2016, we and Qaam Pharmaceuticals LLC (“Qaam”) entered into an exclusive license agreement under which we in-licensed the rights to develop and commercialize RVT-104, a product candidate that combines rivastigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, with a peripherally acting quaternary amine muscarinic receptor antagonist. This combination could provide a means to mitigate the known peripheral side effects of cholinesterase inhibitors and may also allow higher than currently approved doses of cholinesterase inhibitors such as rivastigmine, which may improve treatment of symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and DLB.
Mechanism of Action of RVT-104
Cholinesterase inhibitors are dose-limited by their gastrointestinal tolerability profile, which limits patient adoption and compliance. Peripherally-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists in combination with cholinesterase inhibitors may reduce the gastrointestinal side effects of cholinesterase inhibitors and may also potentially allow higher than currently approved doses of cholinesterase inhibitors to be used.
RVT-104 is the combination of high-dose rivastigmine and a peripherally-acting quaternary amine muscarinic receptor antagonist. Rivastigmine has shown greater efficacy at higher-than approved doses that were not well tolerated. Unlike donepezil, which only inhibits the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, rivastigmine also inhibits the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme, which is also involved in the breakdown of acetylcholine. Thus, there is reason to believe that higher doses of rivastigmine could potentially lead to better efficacy because, in addition to blocking acetylcholinesterase, the activity of butyrylcholinesterase is also addressed.
RVT-104 in Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies
Cholinesterase inhibitors are the standard of care in both Alzheimer’s disease and DLB. Despite their widespread use, many patients cannot tolerate the cholinesterase inhibitors because of their cholinergic side effects such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. We believe that drugs that can mitigate these cholinergic side effects will allow more patients to receive optimal cholinesterase inhibitor therapy as well as potentially allow for dosing with higher than currently approved doses. We are exploring RVT-104, a combination of rivastigmine and a peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonist, as a potential treatment for patients with Alzheimer's disease or DLB. We anticipate making a decision about development plans for this program after an internal portfolio review in the context of any newly acquired product candidates.

Discontinuation of Intepirdine and RVT-103
Intepirdine
We acquired the worldwide rights to intepirdine from Glaxo Group Limited and GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property Development Limited, collectively GSK, under an asset purchase agreement entered into in December 2014 (“the GSK Agreement”). In September 2017, we announced top-line results from the Phase 3 MINDSET trial. At 24 weeks, patients treated with 35 mg of intepirdine did not experience improvement in cognition or in measures of activities of daily living as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) and by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCS-ADL), respectively, compared to patients treated with placebo. In January 2018, we announced results for the Phase 2b HEADWAY trial of intepirdine in patients with DLB and the pilot Phase 2 Gait and Balance trial in patients with dementia and gait impairment. In each of these trials, while intepirdine was generally well tolerated, it did not meet its primary efficacy endpoints. In light of the data from these trials, we have discontinued any further development of intepirdine.
RVT-103
In August 2016, we and Qaam entered into an exclusive license agreement under which we in-licensed the rights to develop and commercialize RVT-103. Following the announcement of Phase 3 MINDSET clinical trial results, we also discontinued further development of RVT-103 which had been intended for use in combination with intepirdine.
Our Key Agreements
Oxford BioMedica License Agreement for AXO-Lenti-PD
On June 5, 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Axovant Sciences GmbH (“ASG”), entered into the Oxford BioMedica Agreement. Pursuant to the Oxford BioMedica Agreement, we received from Oxford BioMedica a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-bearing, sub-licensable license under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by Oxford BioMedica to develop and commercialize AXO-Lenti-PD and related gene therapy products (collectively, the “Gene Therapy Products”) for all diseases and conditions. Our license includes a right of reference to regulatory materials controlled by Oxford BioMedica related to the Gene Therapy Products. We also received from Oxford BioMedica an exclusive option to obtain a worldwide license to other patents and know-how controlled by Oxford BioMedica related to certain technology processes.

We will also be obligated to pay Oxford BioMedica a tiered royalty from 7% to 10%, based on yearly aggregate net sales of the Gene Therapy Products, subject to specified reductions upon the occurrence of certain events as set forth in the Oxford BioMedica Agreement. These royalties are required to be paid, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest to occur of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of a licensed patent covering such product in such country, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country, or 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
Oxford BioMedica will continue to be responsible for the prosecution, maintenance, and enforcement of the licensed patents that relate to the Gene Therapy Products at their expense, but we have the right to take over any prosecution, maintenance, and enforcement of licensed patents that are solely and specifically related to the Gene Therapy Products if Oxford BioMedica fails to act. 
The Oxford BioMedica Agreement will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the royalty payment term described above for such product in such country. We may terminate the Oxford BioMedica Agreement at any time for any reason with prior written notice to Oxford BioMedica. Either party may terminate the Oxford BioMedica Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach of the Oxford BioMedica Agreement or insolvency. 
If the Oxford BioMedica Agreement is terminated in its entirety, all rights and licenses granted to us cease and we must transfer all regulatory filings and know-how related to the Gene Therapy Products to Oxford BioMedica. Oxford BioMedica will reimburse us for the costs associated with such transfer. Upon termination of the Oxford BioMedica Agreement, we must also grant Oxford BioMedica an exclusive license under all patents that cover the Gene Therapy Products and related know-how that we or our affiliates or sublicensees control. We may sell off any existing inventory of Gene Therapy Products for a specified period after termination. 
Arena Development Agreement for Nelotanserin
In October 2015, we exercised an option to acquire global rights, title, interest and obligations in and to nelotanserin from our majority shareholder RSL. In May 2015, RSL entered into a development, marketing and supply agreement for nelotanserin (the “Arena Development Agreement”) with Arena Pharmaceuticals, GmbH (“Arena”) and we entered into a Waiver and Option Agreement with RSL. Upon the exercise of our option, we assumed RSL’s rights and obligations under the Arena Development Agreement, as amended October 18, 2017. In January 2018, we were notified by Arena that it has assigned all of its rights and obligations under the Arena Development Agreement to an affiliate, 125 Royalty Inc. Under the Waiver and Option Agreement, we recorded $5.3 million as research and development expense which was 110% of any payments made to Arena by RSL, and any costs incurred by RSL in connection with the development of nelotanserin. We will be responsible for future contingent payments under the Arena Development Agreement, including up to $4.0 million in potential development milestone payments, up to $37.5 million in potential regulatory milestone payments and up to $60.0 million in potential commercial milestone payments. Under the Arena Development Agreement, we are also obligated to purchase all commercial supplies of nelotanserin from Arena for a fixed price equal to 15% of net sales of nelotanserin.
The Arena Development Agreement will remain in effect until terminated: (1) by the parties’ mutual agreement; (2) for any reason by us upon 90 days’ written notice to Arena; (3) by either party upon written notice for the other party’s material breach or insolvency event if such party fails to cure such breach or the insolvency event is not dismissed within the specified cure period; or (4) by Arena if we or our affiliates participate in a challenge to certain Arena patents.

Services Agreements with Roivant Sciences, Inc. and Roivant Sciences GmbH
In October 2014, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Axovant Sciences, Inc. (“ASI”), entered into a services agreement with Roivant Sciences, Inc. (“RSI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RSL, pursuant to which RSI provides us with services in relation to the identification of potential product candidates and project management of clinical trials, as well as other services related to our development, administrative and financial functions. In February 2017, in connection with the contribution and assignment of all of our intellectual property rights to ASG, we amended and restated this services agreement effective as of December 13, 2016, as a result of which ASG was added as a recipient of services from RSI. In addition, ASG also entered into a separate services agreement with Roivant Sciences GmbH (“RSG”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RSL, effective as of December 13, 2016, for the provision of services by RSG to ASG in relation to the identification of potential product candidates and project management of clinical trials, as well as other services related to development, administrative and financial activities. Under the terms of both services agreements, we are obligated to pay or reimburse RSI and RSG for the costs they, or third parties acting on their behalf, incur in providing services to us or ASG, including administrative and support services as well as research and development services. In addition, we are obligated to pay to RSI and RSG at a pre-determined mark-up on the costs incurred directly by RSI and RSG in connection with any general and administrative and research and development services provided directly by RSI and RSG. 
Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc.
On February 2, 2017, we and our wholly owned subsidiaries, Axovant Holdings Limited (“AHL”), ASG and ASI entered into a loan and security agreement, as amended on May 24, 2017 and September 22, 2017 (the ‘‘Loan Agreement’’), with Hercules Capital, Inc. (“Hercules”), under which we, AHL and ASG, (collectively, the ‘‘Borrowers’’), borrowed an aggregate of $55.0 million (the “Term Loan”). ASI issued a guaranty of the Borrowers’ obligations under the Loan Agreement. At the closing of the Term Loan, the Borrowers paid Hercules a facility charge of $550,000.

The Term Loan has a scheduled maturity date of March 1, 2021. The Borrowers are obligated to make monthly payments of accrued interest under the Loan Agreement until September 1, 2018, followed by monthly installments of principal and interest through March 1, 2021. In connection with the Loan Agreement, the Borrowers and ASI, as guarantor, granted Hercules a first position lien on substantially all of their respective assets, excluding intellectual property. Prepayment of the Term Loan is subject to penalty.
The Loan Agreement includes customary affirmative and restrictive covenants and representations and warranties, including a minimum cash covenant, a covenant against the occurrence of a “change in control,” financial reporting obligations, and certain limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, liens (including a negative pledge on intellectual property and other assets), investments, distributions (including dividends), collateral, transfers, mergers or acquisitions, taxes, corporate changes, and deposit accounts. The Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants following any applicable cure period, the occurrence of certain events that could reasonably be expected to have a “material adverse effect” as set forth in the Loan Agreement, cross acceleration to the debt and certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5.0% may be applied to the outstanding principal balance, and Hercules may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Loan Agreement.
In addition, for so long as the Term Loan remains outstanding, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to afford Hercules the opportunity to participate in future underwritten equity offerings of our common shares up to a total of $3.0 million.
In connection with the entry into the Loan Agreement, we issued a warrant to Hercules which was exercisable for an aggregate of 274,086 of our common shares at an exercise price of $12.04 per share. In August 2017, Hercules exercised the warrant on a cashless basis and received a net issuance of 129,827 of our common shares.
Our Strategy 
Our goal is to become the leading biopharmaceutical company focused on neurology and psychiatry.
The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include:

• | Developing AXO-Lenti-PD for the treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease. In June 2018, we in-licensed AXO-Lenti-PD from Oxford BioMedica. We plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 study of AXO-Lenti-PD before the end of 2018 and will ultimately seek to commercialize this product candidate in the United States and other major markets if approved, potentially through collaborations for non-U.S. markets.

14


• | Acquiring or in-licensing potentially transformative product candidates for the fields of neurology and psychiatry in a capital-efficient manner. We intend to identify, acquire, develop and commercialize novel product candidates for the fields of neurology and psychiatry. In evaluating product acquisition candidates, we focus on candidates that are in or near clinical-stage development that offer improved solutions to patients and leverage our business infrastructure. In addition, our acquisition strategy has been to acquire global rights for these compounds wherever possible.


• | Acquire or in-licensing other CNS-focused gene therapies to leverage our developing capabilities in the gene therapy field with our CNS drug development expertise. We intend to identify, acquire, develop and commercialize other novel CNS-focused gene therapy candidates. These gene therapy candidates may be in the nonclinical stage of development.


• | Developing nelotanserin for the treatment of Lewy Body Dementia and related disorders. In January 2018, we reported results for a pilot Phase 2 clinical study of nelotanserin in patients with either DLB or Parkinson’s disease dementia who experience frequent visual hallucinations. In March 2016, we initiated a second Phase 2 study of nelotanserin in patients with either DLB or Parkinson’s disease dementia suffering from RBD. We plan to make a determination of the overall development strategy for nelotanserin once the RBD data is available in the second half of 2018 and after we complete our ongoing comprehensive clinical, regulatory and commercial review in the context of any newly acquired clinical assets.


• | Maximizing the commercial potential of our product candidates. We plan to directly commercialize our product candidates in the United States and the European Union, if approved. In other markets for which commercialization may be less capital efficient for us, we may selectively pursue strategic collaborations with third parties in order to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates, if approved.

Sales and Marketing 
We plan to build our own marketing, sales and distribution capabilities. In order to commercialize our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, we must either develop a sales and marketing infrastructure or collaborate with third parties that have sales and marketing experience. We plan to directly commercialize our product candidates in the United States and Europe. In other markets for which commercialization may be less capital efficient for us, we may selectively pursue strategic collaborations with third parties in order to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates. 
Manufacturing 
We are building teams with gene therapy, drug formulation and manufacturing expertise but do not own or operate facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. 
The Oxford BioMedica Agreement provides that Oxford BioMedica will transfer its existing inventory of AXO-Lenti-PD to us, which we intend to use in our planned Phase 1/2 study. Oxford BioMedica will manufacture and supply the Gene Therapy Products to us in accordance with separate clinical and commercial supply agreements that will be negotiated by the parties. Pursuant to the Oxford BioMedica Agreement, such clinical and commercial supply agreements will contain certain key provisions as set forth in the Oxford BioMedica Agreement, including the pricing structure and our ability to transfer the technology to another manufacturer at any time following the completion of formal process characterization, process validation or BLA submission.
Under the Arena Development Agreement, we are obligated to obtain all commercial supplies of nelotanserin exclusively from Arena, and we are completely dependent upon Arena to manufacture or otherwise procure sufficient quantities of nelotanserin for commercial sale, if nelotanserin is approved. We do not have any right, even if Arena fails to satisfy its supply obligations, to manufacture nelotanserin ourselves or to engage a contract manufacturer to make it for us for commercial sale. In addition to Arena supplying nelotanserin drug product for clinical development activities, we have contracted with third parties to produce nelotanserin drug substance and drug product for use in clinical development.
Manufacturing of any product candidate is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. We expect that Oxford BioMedica will manufacture AXO-Lenti-PD and Arena will manufacture or procure nelotanserin under cGMP. cGMP is a regulatory requirement for the production of pharmaceuticals to be used in humans.

Competition 
We consider our most direct competitor with respect to AXO-Lenti-PD to be Voyager Therapeutics, which is developing VY-AADC, a gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease. VY-AADC delivers the AADC gene, one of the three genes contained in AXO-Lenti-PD, via an Adeno-Associated Virus. Voyager anticipates entering a Phase 3 study in mid-2018. Agilis Biotherapeutics is developing AGIL-AADC, another AAV gene therapy that delivers the AADC gene, for the treatment of AADC deficiency, a rare disorder that involves loss of AADC gene function. In addition, DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) is approved for treating Parkinson’s disease and is marketed by multiple device manufacturers, including Medtronic, Abbott and Boston Scientific. DBS treatment involves permanent placement of hardware in the brain via stereotactic neurosurgery and may require follow-up adjustments or even invasive device replacements. Another surgical approach is Abbvie’s Duopa which is delivered via a port implanted in the abdominal wall. Further efforts are also underway to develop new improved formulations of L-dopa, including Acorda’s Inbrija and Mitsubishi Tanabe’s ND0612. Adjunct therapies are also being developed or have recently been approved to supplement L-dopa therapy, including Sunovion’s sublingual apopmorphine and Adamas Pharmaceuticals’ GoCovri. Several companies are also trying to develop other disease modifying therapies that could prevent the progression of Parkinson’s disease. Examples of these early stage efforts include Denali Therapeutics’ LRRK2 inhibitors and anti-alpha synuclein antibodies from Prothena/Roche and Biogen, as well as Prevail Therapeutics’ pipeline of AAV-based therapeutics targeting lysosomal dysfunction.
We consider our most direct competitor with respect to nelotanserin to be Acadia Pharmaceuticals, which is marketing and developing pimavanserin, a 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonist that received FDA approval in April 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis. We believe the FDA approval of pimavanserin adds further validation to the therapeutic relevance of 5-HT2A as a potential target for the treatment of visual hallucinations.
In addition to other 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonists in active development, we are aware of many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies as well as academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions that are developing, and may in the future develop and commercialize, products for Lewy body dementia and other indications in the fields of neurology and psychiatry.
Drug development is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological advancements. Our ability to compete will significantly depend upon our ability to complete necessary clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, and effectively market any drug that we may successfully develop. Our current and potential future competitors include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and government agencies. The primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of any product candidate for which we may receive marketing approval include efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, dosing convenience, price, coverage and reimbursement. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the United States and in foreign countries. Our current and potential future competitors also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors. 
Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment method for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia and other indications in the fields of neurology and psychiatry by a competitor could render our product candidates non-competitive or obsolete or reduce the demand for our product candidates before we can recover our development and commercialization expenses. 
Intellectual Property 
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for nelotanserin and AXO-Lenti-PD, any of our future product candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and other know-how. Our commercial success also depends on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and our ability to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing and acquisition opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
While we seek broad coverage under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the process of obtaining patents or changes to the patent law in the United States or elsewhere may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to challenge or avoid infringement of our patents. In addition, patents, if granted, expire and we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any potentially issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property.
16

Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended via a Patent Term Adjustment (“PTA’’), to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's (the “USPTO’’) delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period via a Patent Term Extension (“PTE’’). However, as to the FDA component, the PTE period can be applied to only one patent per approved product, cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the PTE period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval of an NDA. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. The patent term of a European patent is 20 years from its filing date; however, unlike in the United States, a European patent is not granted PTA for delays at the European Patent Office. However, the European Union does have a compensation program similar to the U.S.’s PTE called Supplementary Patent Certificate (“SPC’’) that would effectively extend patent protection for up to five years on one patent and the total patent term including the SPC must not exceed 15 years following the EMA granting of marketing authorization. Other major markets, including Japan, have similar patent term extension provisions and we intend to seek patent term extensions in those countries that have such programs. 
In June 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, ASG, entered into the Oxford BioMedica Agreement with Oxford BioMedica. Pursuant to the Oxford BioMedica Agreement, we received from Oxford BioMedica a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-bearing, sub-licensable license under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by Oxford BioMedica to develop and commercialize the Gene Therapy Products for all diseases and conditions. Oxford BioMedica is prohibited from granting licenses to third parties to develop, commercialize, or distribute such lentiviral-based vector products. The licensed IP includes issued U.S. and foreign patents and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications that cover AXO-Lenti-PD as a composition of matter as well as methods of making and using AXO-Lenti-PD in major markets, including the United States, Japan, China, India, the United Kingdom, Australia, and South Korea. These patents and applications, if issued, are projected to expire starting at the end of 2018, with the last to expire in October of 2032 (not taking into account any PTA, which may be obtained in the future). The initial U.S. composition of matter patent for AXO-Lenti-PD naturally expires in 2023 inclusive of PTA, and we expect a follow-on patent to be issued that will expire in 2032 (not taking into account any PTA, which may be obtained in the future). The term of that follow-on patent may be extended by up to five years with PTE. 
In October 2015, we assumed RSL’s rights and obligations under the Arena Development Agreement for nelotanserin. Pursuant to the Arena Development Agreement, we have the exclusive right to commercialize and distribute nelotanserin worldwide. Arena is prohibited from granting licenses to third parties to develop, commercialize, or distribute nelotanserin. We have the exclusive first rights to bring any action with respect to infringement by any third party of the patents covered under the Arena Development Agreement. The patents include issued U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications that cover nelotanserin and analogues thereof as a composition of matter as well as methods of use in major markets, including the United States, Japan, China, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, Canada, Russia, India, Australia and South Korea, and have applications pending in a number of other jurisdictions. These patents and applications start to expire in 2024. The U.S. composition of matter patent for nelotanserin naturally expires in 2028 inclusive of PTA and the term of this patent may be extended by up to five years with PTE. We also own several pending U.S., corresponding PCT applications and foreign applications directed to uses of nelotanserin alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical agents, which, if granted, would extend the patent life of certain uses of nelotanserin to between 2036 and 2037.
Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part by using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
17

Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.
Government Regulation 
FDA Drug Approval Process 
In the United States, pharmaceutical and biological products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA’’), and the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA’’). The FDCA, PHSA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 
We cannot market a new drug or biological product candidate, including gene therapy product candidates which are regulated as biologics, in the United States until the product candidate has received FDA approval. The steps required before a new drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally include the following:

• | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP’’) regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (“IND’’) for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP’’) requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA, in the case of biological product candidates including gene therapy product candidates, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of sites involved in our clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API’’) and finished drug product or biological product are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMPs; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.

Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 
Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. If the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial, such as whether human research subjects will be exposed to an unreasonable health risk, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. 
18

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations, including GCP requirements, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (“IRB’’) for approval at each site at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions.
U.S. Biological Products Development Process
Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
Where a gene therapy study is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving funding from the NIH for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation is submitted to and the study is registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities (“OBA’’), pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (“NIH Guidelines’’). Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities’ Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (“RAC’’), a federal advisory committee, that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public. Recent changes in the procedures for the RAC process issued by the NIH now include evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee (“IBC”), a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. Annual reporting of clinical trial data including safety information also is required.
The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some nonclinical testing typically continues after the IND is submitted. An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational product to humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA requests certain changes to a protocol before the study can begin, or the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.
19

Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic (or both) nucleic acid molecules performed at or sponsored by an institution that receives any NIH funding for such research also must be reviewed by an IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. Guidelines on clinical trials with gene therapy products issued by the FDA's Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies state that the FDA has determined that the benefit-risk ratio of these products does not warrant their evaluation in healthy human subjects.


• | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of trial subjects.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics, regulated as biologics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the studies in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System which includes information on gene transfer studies and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these studies. 
20

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA, must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA’’), a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication. 
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The application also needs to be published and submitted in an electronic format that can be processed through the FDA’s electronic systems. If the electronic submission is not compatible with FDA’s systems, the BLA can be refused to file. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS’’), is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. As a condition for approval, the FDA may also require additional nonclinical testing as a Phase 4 commitment.
One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review standard BLAs in 10 months from filing and priority BLAs in six months from filing, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Following approval, the manufacturing facilities are subject to biennial inspections by the FDA’s biologics team and such inspections may result in an issuance of FDA Form 483 deficiency observations or a warning letter, which can lead to plant shutdown and other more serious penalties and fines. Prior to the institution of any manufacturing changes, a determination needs to be made whether FDA approval is required in advance. If not done in accordance with FDA expectations, the FDA may restrict supply and may take further action. Annual product reports are required to be submitted annually. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. Systems need to be put in place to record and evaluate adverse events reported by health care providers and patients and to assess product complaints. An increase in severity or new adverse events can result in labeling changes or product recall. Defects in manufacturing of commercial products can result in product recalls.
We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval or license revocation, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

U.S. Pharmaceutical Products Development Process
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval for pharmaceutical drug candidates are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine metabolism, pharmacokinetics, the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials, also called pivotal or registration trials, are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and where confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program fees. These fees are typically increased annually.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within 10 to 12 months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs to treat serious conditions that the FDA determines offer significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMPs and GCPs is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities and clinical sites, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS’’) to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include a medication guide, a communication plan for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, such as special training and certification requirements for individuals who prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry and other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
23

Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. Such supplements are typically reviewed within 10 months of receipt.
Once an NDA is approved, a product is subject to post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS or surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or restrictions on the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

Market and Data Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 or BPCIA. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. As of January 1, 2018, the FDA has approved nine biosimilar products for use in the United States. No interchangeable biosimilars have been approved. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Additional guidance is expected to be finalized by FDA in the near term.
Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the FDA must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. The BPCIA also requires a 180-day notice of commercial marketing. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own nonclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
24

Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product. 
The centralized procedure results in a single marketing authorization, or MA, granted by the European Commission that is valid across the EEA (i.e., the European Union as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) officially designated orphan medicines and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used in certain other cases. Therefore, the centralized procedure would be mandatory for the products we are developing. 
The Committee for Advanced Therapies (“CAT”) is responsible in conjunction with the CHMP for the evaluation of ATMPs. The CAT is primarily responsible for the scientific evaluation of ATMPs and prepares a draft opinion on the quality, safety and efficacy of each ATMP for which a marketing authorization application is submitted. The CAT’s opinion is then taken into account by the CHMP when giving its final recommendation regarding the authorization of a product in view of the balance of benefits and risks identified. Although the CAT’s draft opinion is submitted to the CHMP for final approval, the CHMP may depart from the draft opinion, if it provides detailed scientific justification. The CHMP and CAT are also responsible for providing guidelines on ATMPs and have published numerous guidelines, including specific guidelines on gene therapies and cell therapies. These guidelines provide additional guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of ATMPs and include, among other things, the preclinical studies required to characterize ATMPs; the manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a marketing authorization application; and post-approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long term efficacy and potential adverse reactions of ATMPs. Although these guidelines are not legally binding, we believe that our compliance with them is likely necessary to gain and maintain approval for any of our product candidates. 
Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days. This excludes so-called clock stops, during which additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. At the end of the review period, the CHMP provides an opinion to the European Commission. If this is opinion favorable, the Commission may then adopt a decision to grant an MA. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of an MAA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). This is usually when the product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. 
25

EU Data and Marketing Exclusivity 
The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Marketing authorization applications for generic medicinal products do not need to include the results of preclinical and clinical trials, but instead can refer to the data included in the marketing authorization of a reference product for which regulatory data exclusivity has expired. In the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. 
There is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or manufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical trials must be provided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product. There are no such guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal products, and so it is unlikely that biosimilars of those products will currently be approved in the European Union. However, guidance from the EMA states that they will be considered in the future in light of the scientific knowledge and regulatory experience gained at the time.
EU Orphan Medicinal Products 
Products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can receive ten years of market exclusivity. During the ten year market exclusivity period, the EMA cannot accept another application for a marketing authorization, or grant a marketing authorization or accept an application to extend an existing marketing authorization, for the same therapeutic indication, in respect of a similar medicinal product. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. 
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the MAA. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the MAA if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, an MA may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if: 

• | the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;


• | the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or


• | the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.

26

EU Pediatric Investigation Plan 
In the EMA, MAAs for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of trials conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which an MA is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data are not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the MA is obtained in all EU Member States and trial results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for a six-months supplementary protection certificate extension. 
EU Post-Approval Controls 
The holder of an MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs. 
All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions. 
All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each EU Member State and can differ from one country to another. 
EU Pricing and Reimbursement 
Governments influence the price of medicinal products in the European Union through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. 
27

Other Healthcare Laws 
Although we currently do not have any products on the market, our current and future business operations may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting and physician sunshine laws. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to some of these laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced-price items and services. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, and can also result in criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Persons and entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to "cause" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, certain of our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for federal civil False Claims Act violations may include up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, False Claims Act violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA’’) created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
28

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH’’) and their implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. At present, it is unclear if we would be considered a business associate subject to HIPAA based on our business activities and service offerings upon the commercialization of a product. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney's fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state and foreign laws, regulations, standards and regulatory guidance govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties.
The Affordable Care Act, through the enactment of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, imposes, among other things, new annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties.
Many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures as well as state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Additionally, to the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we will continue to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject. Although the development and implementation of compliance programs designed to establish internal control and facilitate compliance can mitigate the risk of violating these laws, and the subsequent investigation, prosecution, and penalties assessed for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
29

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (“FCPA’’). The FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from processing, offering, or making payments of money or anything of value to foreign officials with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. In certain countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for the purposes of the FCPA. Our international activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants and agents, even though they may not always be subject to our control. We discourage these practices by our employees, consultants, and agents. However, our existing safeguards may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, and agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement activity by both the Department of Justice and the SEC. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of suppliers, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses or permits, and legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or governmental investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence.
Other Applicable Laws
We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations, both in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which we operate, as a public company in the U.S., including laws relating to the oversight activities of the SEC and the regulations of the Nasdaq Global Select Market, on which our common shares are traded.
We are also subject to various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including those related to safe working conditions, and the storage, transportation, or discharge of items that may be considered hazardous substances, hazardous waste, or environmental contaminants. 
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
We are also subject to or affected by federal, state and foreign privacy, security and data protection laws, regulations, standards and regulatory guidance that govern the collection, use, disclosure, retention, security and transfer of personal data. Our operations extend to countries around the world, and many of these jurisdictions have established privacy legal frameworks with which we, our customers or our vendors must comply.
Healthcare Reform 
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. There have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs.
In particular, the Affordable Care Act has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the Affordable Care Act revises the definition of “average manufacturer price’’ (“AMP’’) for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products. In January 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a final rule regarding the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, effective April 1, 2016, that, among other things, revises the manner in which the AMP is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the program and implements certain amendments to the Medicaid rebate statute created under the Affordable Care Act. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare providers and entities, and a significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective.

Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as efforts by the current administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, since January 2017, the President has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act were signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Additionally, on January 22, 2018, the President signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain Affordable Care Act -mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole,” and increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in the Medicare Part D program. There may be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. The Affordable Care Act is likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
Further, there has been heightened government scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed pharmaceutical products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the current administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, on May 11, 2018, the President of the United States laid out his administration’s “Blueprint to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out-of-Pocket Costs” to reduce the cost of prescription drugs while preserving innovation and cures. The Department of Health and Human Services has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. Although some of these and other proposals will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the U.S. presidential administration have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or foreign, could affect prospects for our product candidates or what actions foreign, federal, state, or private payors for health care treatment and services may take in response to any such health care reform proposals or legislation. Adoption of price controls and other cost-containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures reforms may prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.
Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing, which is being phased in over several years beginning in 2015. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.

Coverage and Reimbursement 
Sales of our products, if and when approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, private health insurers and managed care organizations. Third-party payors generally decide which drugs they will cover and establish certain reimbursement levels for such drugs. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of our product candidates, and those of any future product candidate, will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates, and those of any future product candidate, will be paid by third-party payors. Additionally, the market for our product candidates, and those of any future product candidate, will depend significantly on access to third-party payors' formularies without prior authorization, step therapy, or other limitations such as approved lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor's decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will likely be a time-consuming process.
Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs (including drug prices) has become a priority of federal and state governments. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution by generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products once approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products once approved or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have an adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, state and federal healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
