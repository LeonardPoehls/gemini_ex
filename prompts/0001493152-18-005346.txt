ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Players Network was incorporated in the State of Nevada in March of 1993. Players Network is actively pursuing the cultivation and processing of medical and recreational marijuana in North Las Vegas pursuant to two medical marijuana establishments (MME) licenses that were granted by the city of North Las Vegas for cultivation and production to its majority-owned subsidiary, Green Leaf Farms Holdings LLC, in which the Company holds an 85.4% interest. We also distribute content relating to the cannabis industry at WeedTV.com.
Green Leaf Cannabis Business
 
Green Leaf was granted two Medical Marijuana Establishment (MME) licenses by the City of North Las Vegas and State of Nevada; one for cultivation, and one for production of extracts, along with cultivation and production licenses for recreational cannabis that went into effect on July 1, 2017.
 
The cannabis industry is one of the fastest growing markets in the America, and Nevada is uniquely positioned to become one of, if not the largest market in the country. The sale of cannabis in Nevada for medical purposes has been legal since 2015, and on July 1, 2017, the recreational use of cannabis became legal in the State of Nevada.
 
It is estimated that there is 43,000 Nevada State issued medical marijuana cardholders. Nevada also offers reciprocity to Out-of-State medical cannabis cardholders. With nearly one million medical marijuana cardholders residing in states adjacent to Nevada, and more than 52 million annual visitors to Nevada, the market for medical marijuana is substantial, and with the recent passage of recreational marijuana laws that were implemented in the summer of 2017, Nevada is expected to generate $1.8 billion in revenue from cannabis in 2018. As large as the medical marijuana market is, it is dwarfed by Nevada’s adult recreational marijuana market.
 
Green Leaf offers the following products and services:
 

● | Premium organic medical cannabis sold wholesale to licensed retailers 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Recreational marijuana cannabis products sold wholesale to distributors and retailers 
● | Extraction products such as oils and waxes derived from in-house cannabis production 
● | Processing and extraction services for licensed medical cannabis cultivators in Nevada 
● | High quality cannabis strains in the form of vegetative cuttings for sale to licensed medical cannabis cultivators in Nevada 

Media Content Distribution; Weed TV
 
Historically, we have distributed video and other media content over cable television channels and a wide variety of internet enabled devices, focusing primarily on the gaming industry and Las Vegas lifestyle. Our current media operations are focused on our recently launched Web site, WeedTV.com, and its related social media presence.
 
Weed TV is a source of informational entertainment, products and services for people who relate to the marijuana lifestyle and social community. Weed TV content is currently available at www.weedtv.com. We plan to continuously add features and content to Weed TV, including a directory of businesses that cater to the marijuana business, such as dispensaries, smoke shops, doctors, financial institutions, manufacturers and more.
 
Future Outlook
 
Green Leaf plans to focus on developing high quality products and to employ a strong branding strategy to sell its custom cannabis strains. The quality and consistency of our branded products would help build consumer loyalty. The growing facility, with modular construction would allow us to scale efficiency from both a cost and operational standpoint. 
Market Opportunity for Media Platform
 
The Company believes it has an opportunity to capitalize on its early adoption of its technology and digital platforms. The digital revolution has rapidly changed the way consumers access television content. Instead of scheduled programming, video can now be viewed “On Demand” through digital cable television and satellite networks, broadband internet, and by downloading content to mobile and wireless devices such as smart phones and tablets.
 
Each new network is expected to become an integrated channel destination that will include VOD television and a social community to complete and complement a vertical distribution and marketing strategy. Each network is expected to command a new audience and generate advertisement revenues tied to the amount of monthly viewers. We plan on integrating our website destinations with social media elements in order to create communities and increase memberships.

Media Distribution
 
We intend to heavily market and cross-promote Weed TV and are actively exploring additional relationships through social media networks. We also intend to use our website to develop cannabis communities, then offer the members of these communities live video events, information services, discounts, travel, internet based commerce, etc., as well as instant messaging, chat, comments, reviews and perspectives from consumers on a variety of topical subjects.
 
Content/Programming
 
The development of our programming is led by Michael Berk, a successful Hollywood television producer. Michael Berk has created over 500 hours of network television that includes five television series. Mr. Berk is best known for his series “Baywatch”, for which he was the Executive Producer for twelve years. Baywatch is distributed in 144 countries and is in the Guinness Book of World Records as the most watched television show in history.


Our Weed TV brand recently began developing original content as well as acquiring the rights to other marijuana related programming that includes documentaries, cooking shows, concerts, travel shows, growing shows, medical shows, political shows, financial shows and more. We have produced an aggregated of over 450 original short video segments to feature documentaries that we own or have rebroadcast rights for.

Competition
 
Cannabis
 
Green Leaf’s cannabis business is subject to intense and increasing competition. Some of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources, facilities and infrastructure then we have, which enable them to compete more effectively in this market. These competitors include subsidiaries of TerraTech Corp., which is a public company, and numerous other local businesses engaged in the cultivation and production of cannabis, and the operation of dispensary facilities in Nevada. Numerous companies not currently operating were also granted MME licenses, and, therefore, we anticipate that Green Leaf will face competition with these other companies especially those with locations near Green Leaf’s facilities.
Media
 
Weed TV faces intense competition from a variety of other companies. In addition to other Web sites that provide content focused on the cannabis industry, we face competition from other media businesses, as well as other media, such as newspapers, magazines, television, direct mail, mobile devices, satellite radio, Internet-based services and live entertainment. Our competitors may develop technology, services or advertising media that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve.
Intellectual Property
 
We have a library of over 1,800 gaming and cannabis lifestyle videos. We own the intellectual property rights in the programming and content that we produce. Moreover, the slogans, “WeedTV.com”, “Everybody wants to be a player” and “The only game in town” are trademarks we have registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”). “Players Network” is also a registered trademark with the PTO.
Governmental Approval and Regulation
 
Cannabis Business
 
As of December 2017, 29 states and the District of Columbia have passed legislation legalizing medicinal cannabis, and eight of those states and the District of Columbia have legalized the recreational use of cannabis. These state laws are in direct conflict with the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act, under which cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is viewed as having a high potential for abuse, with no currently-accepted use for medical treatment in the U.S. State laws vary, but generally exempt patients who use medicinal cannabis under a physician’s supervision from state criminal penalties.
 
The conflict between federal and state laws has also limited the access to banking and other financial services by marijuana businesses. Recently the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Treasury issued guidance for banks considering conducting business with marijuana dispensaries in states where those businesses are legal, pursuant to which banks must now file a Marijuana Limited Suspicious Activity Report that states the marijuana business is following the government’s guidelines with regard to revenue that is generated exclusively from legal sales. However, since the same guidance noted that banks could still face prosecution if they provide financial services to marijuana businesses, it has led to the widespread refusal of the banking industry to offer banking services to marijuana businesses operating within state and local laws.
 
On August 29, 2013, United States Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued the Cole Memo to United States Attorneys guiding them to prioritize enforcement of Federal law away from the cannabis industry operating as permitted under state law, so long as:
 

● | cannabis is not being distributed to minors and dispensaries are not located around schools and public buildings; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the proceeds from sales are not going to gangs, cartels or criminal enterprises; 
● | cannabis grown in states where it is legal is not being diverted to other states; 
● | cannabis-related businesses are not being used as a cover for sales of other illegal drugs or illegal activity; 
● | there is not any violence or use of fire-arms in the cultivation and sale of marijuana; 
● | there is strict enforcement of drugged-driving laws and adequate prevention of adverse health consequences; and 
● | cannabis is not grown, used, or possessed on Federal properties. 

 
The Cole Memo was meant only as a guide for United States Attorneys and did not alter in any way the Department of Justice’s Federal authority to enforce Federal law, including Federal laws relating to cannabis, regardless of state law.
 
On January 4, 2018, United States Attorney General Jefferson Sessions issued a Memorandum to United States Attorneys rescinding the Cole Memo, stating that prosecutors should follow well-established principles in effect prior to the issuance of the Cole Memo that govern all federal prosecutions in deciding which activities to prosecute under existing federal laws. The federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us.
 
Media Business
 
We do not believe that any governmental approvals are required to distribute our media products or services. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, govern the distribution of video programming by cable, satellite or over-the-air technology, through regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”). However, because our media distribution systems do not use any public rights of way, they are not classified as cable systems and are subject to minimal regulation. Thus, the FCC does not directly regulate our programming.
 
Although the FCC generally does not directly regulate the services provided by us, the regulation of media distribution and communications services is subject to the political process and has been in constant flux over the past decade. Further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements must be anticipated and there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by future legislation or new regulations.

Employees
 
We currently have two full-time employees: our chief executive officer, Mark Bradley, and our chief financial officer Geoffrey Lawrence. In addition, we currently have engaged approximately 20 outside consultants to cover needed support such as business affairs, programming and technology design, cultivation and deployment supported by independent contractors on an as needed basis. Management will hire additional employees on an as needed basis. None of our employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreement or labor union contract, nor has the Company been subjected to any strikes or employment disruptions in its history. We are using, and intend to continue to use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services when and as they are deemed necessary. We believe that the use of third-party service providers may enhance our ability to contain general and administrative expenses.
