ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report, references to “Q2Earth,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us” and words of similar import refer to Q2Earth, Inc., the Registrant, a Delaware corporation. References to “Q2P” or the “Subsidiary” refer to Q2Power Corp., a Delaware corporation, our subsidiary and former operating company.
 
Organizational History and Merger with Q2P
 
The Company, formerly known as Anpath Group, Inc. (“Anpath”), was organized pursuant of the laws of the State of Delaware on August 26, 2004. On January 10, 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of EnviroSystems Inc., a Nevada corporation (“ESI”), pursuant to which ESI became a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the Company. The Company conducted all its business through ESI, and on January 12, 2007, changed its name to Anpath. Effective August 5, 2015, Anpath effected a one for seven (1 for 7) reverse split of our outstanding common stock (the “Reverse Split”). All computations contained herein take into account the Reverse Split.
 
On November 12, 2015, the Company, its newly formed and wholly-owned subsidiary, AnPath Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Subsidiary”), and Q2P consummated their Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), resulting in the Merger Subsidiary merging with and into Q2P. As a result, Q2P was the surviving company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of AnPath (the “Merger”).
 
As a result of the Merger, all outstanding shares of Q2P were exchanged for 24,034,475 shares of the Company’s common stock, representing approximately 93% of the total issued and outstanding common stock of the Company, excluding stock options, warrants and convertible notes outstanding at such time. In addition, the Company assumed both the Q2P 2014 Founders Stock Option Plan and the 2014 Employees Stock Option Plan (the “Option Plans”), and 1,095,480 options outstanding thereunder. Also pursuant to the Merger, the officers and directors of Q2P took over the management and Board of Directors of the Company.
 
In connection with the Merger, the Company sold the former operating entity of Anpath, ESI, to three former officers and shareholders of Anpath in exchange for the return of 470,560 shares of common stock of the Company and ESI retaining all of the old liabilities of ESI including a litigation judgment.
 
In December 2015, the Company officially changed its name to Q2Power Technologies, Inc. to reflect the new business direction of the Company – that of Q2P, namely the development of waste heat and waste fuel-to-power systems – after the Merger. In February 2016, the Company changed its fiscal year end from March 31 to December 31 to reflect the year-end of its operating Subsidiary, and up-listed its common stock to the OTCQB. The financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements reflect this change of fiscal year end.
 
In August 2017, the Company sold its waste-to-power technology to a licensee and focused its efforts and resources to the pursuit of acquisitions of the companies and assets in the business of compost and soil manufacturing. This business model arose from the work the Company was doing with wastewater treatment plants and other external factors that led its Board to believe that opportunities would present the most beneficial path forward for the Company and its shareholders. In June 2017, the Company changed its name to Q2Earth, Inc. to better reflect its new business model.
 
Q2P’s Prior Waste-to-Power Business
 
Q2P was originally formed as a Florida limited liability company by Cyclone Power Technologies, Inc. (“Cyclone”) to pursue development and commercialization of its patented waste heat recovery engine. In July 2014, Q2P commenced operations as an independent company after receiving its initial round of funding and signing a formal Separation Agreement with Cyclone. From then until the end of 2016, the business of Q2P was the development of waste heat and waste fuel-to-power systems based on core technology licensed from Cyclone on a worldwide exclusive basis for 20 years, with two 10-year renewal terms.

Q2P’s prime target market for its waste-to-power technology (the “Q2P Technology”) was small-scale Waste Water Treatment Plants (“WWTPs”), whereby the Q2P Technology could capture methane produced from the WWTPs and convert it into power and usable heat. The Q2P Technology was comprised of our unique external heat engine (the “Q2P Engine”) as well as waste fuel burners, controls and other subcomponents (collectively with the Q2P Engine, referred to as a “CHP System”). We developed the CHP System from proof-of-concept to a working “pilot stage” product between 2014 and 2015.
 
Our pilot program operated in central Ohio for approximately six months, during which time we collected significant information about the technology itself, and the operations and cost structures of WWTPs generally. A large portion of a WWTP’s operating expenditures are spent removing the residual sludge (called “biosolids”) from digesters, that vast portion of which is either combusted, landfilled or applied directly to the land. Technologies and processes that can convert biosolids to other useful products, such as compost and engineered soils, we determined, could provide additional value to agricultural and construction sector customers and new revenue streams for this waste value chain. In mid-2016, along with the addition of two new Board of Director members with vast experience in the waste water, biosolids and waste recycling sectors, the Company started pursuing synergistic alliances with companies that have both technology and business networks for the manufacturing and sale of such beneficial re-use products. This led us to the composting industry.
 
Current Business Model: Compost and Engineered Soils 
 
Overview. According to the U.S Composting Council, one-third of the world’s arable land has been lost to soil erosion. In the United States, 99 million acres (28% of all cropland) are eroding above soil tolerance rates, meaning the long-term productivity of the soil cannot be maintained and new soil is not adequately replacing the lost soil. This erosion reduces the ability of the soil to support plant growth and store water, making food production more difficult, reducing the earth’s ability to filter out carbon and produce oxygen, and adding significant pressure on water resources.
 
Management believes that soil health may be one of the most important issues facing our planet, affecting the food we eat, water we drink, and air we breathe. Composting is a critical process for recycling organic wastes for beneficial uses to replenish top soil, conserve water and reduce pollution. Composting further protects our climate by sequestering carbon in the soil, and reducing methane production from landfills by reducing the volume of organic wastes disposed in this manner.
 
The composting industry is highly fragmented, comprised of over 5,000 facilities throughout the United States, most of which are small in size and supplying varying product qualities. An estimated $5.6 billion in compost is sold annually in the United States, according to the U.S. Compost Council, but less than 10% of farms nationwide currently utilize compost to supplement top soil and reduce chemical and water requirements. New applications for compost such as engineered soils used in general construction, infrastructure projects, land reclamation, sod and turf farms and other green landscape projects are creating additional business opportunities globally.
 
One of the most compelling business aspects of the compost industry in management’s opinion is the trend among certain facilities to view their business less as simply a waste management solution (making money through “tipping fees” – i.e., the fees paid to take waste), and more as a manufacturing process to produce higher end compost and soil products that can be sold at higher margins and have beneficial uses for our planet.
 
We also believe that the composting industry in the United States is prime for consolidation, operational and technological efficiency improvements, and comprehensive sales and marketing strategies to increase demand and usage. We have a plan in place to build the Company over the next years by acquiring strategic compost facilities and established distribution channels and brands, and developing procedures and programs to foster organic growth.
 
Acquisition and Funding Strategy. The Company seeks to acquire companies and assets in the compost and soils sector. These targets include both operating compost facilities and independent sales companies with established distribution and product brands. Through a mixture of these acquisitions located in key regions, management believes we can grow rapidly but prudently.

The Company is currently in discussions and has letters of intent, terms sheets, exclusivity agreements and other agreements with multiple potential acquisition targets, which it may acquire solely or in connection with strategic partners. Initial acquisitions include leaders in the industry with well-run facilities focused on end product (i.e., compost and soil) production and sales, and established brands, and well as companies that demonstrate qualities that, given proper funding and management, could become leaders in the field. Management believes that other future acquisition targets may include undervalued facilities in key locations that, through better management and more focus on end product production, management believes can become profitable in a short period of time.
 
Bridge Financing. In connection with this plan, on March 31, 2017, the Company closed the initial $1,050,000 in its Convertible Promissory Note “Bridge” offering (the “Bridge Offering”). In addition, as part of that initial closing, three of the Company’s directors and one shareholder converted $168,152 of prior notes and cash advances, including interest thereon, into the Bridge Offering. As of the end of 2017, an additional $600,000 was raised under the Bridge Offering and $23,756 of additional prior notes were converted into this round.
 
The Convertible Promissory Notes (the “Notes”) convert at a 50% discount to the post-funding valuation of the Company at the closing of its next offering in the minimum amount of $5,000,000 (the “Equity Offering”). The conversion valuation has a ceiling of $12,000,000, and a “floor” company value of $6,000,000 in the event there is no Equity Offering before the Notes are able to be converted. The Notes convert into common stock, or preferred stock if received by investors in the Equity Offering, commencing on the soonest of the Equity Offering closing or December 31, 2017, at the discretion of the holder. Maturity is 36 months from issuance with 15% annual interest which will be capitalized each year into the principal of the Notes and paid in kind. There are no warrants issued in connection with the Bridge Offering.
 
Funds from the Bridge Offering have been used over the last year to secure acquisitions of compost and soil companies with closings expected to occur concurrently with the closing of the Equity Offering. The Bridge Offering was led by two accredited investors and joined by 29 additional accredited investors which included the Company’s Directors. Management conducted the Bridge Offering and no broker fees were paid in connection with the initial closing.
 
Future Financing. Management is currently working on securing the next round of funding needed to close the initial projected acquisitions. We believe this round would be a minimum of $10 million inclusive of debt and equity securities, and be consummated sometime in 2018 at a valuation to be determined based on the consolidated pro-forma revenue/EBITDA projections of initial acquisitions. Management can make no guaranty that such financing can be completed on terms acceptable to the Company if at all.


Business of Compost and Soils
 
Tipping Fees. The business of composting, especially biosolids, has historically been driven by tipping fees – the amount paid to the compost facility to haul and receive waste products. In the case of biosolids, tipping fees range from $35 to $60 (or more based on location) per ton, with $44 per ton being the average. In the case of yard or “green” waste, these fees are significantly less, ranging from $4 per ton to $8 per ton. A medium to large compost facility may accept between 100 and 200 tons of biosolids per day, or between 30,000 and 60,000 tons per year. A facility accepting yard waste may take in up to 10 times that amount per day.
 
Costs of hauling wastes are typically the largest portion of receiving these feedstocks, comprising about 50% of the tipping fee. Costs to manufacture compost, mainly labor, equipment, fuel and other direct overhead, usually comprise between 30% and 40% of the tipping fee. This provides a typical compost facility with gross margins on the manufacturing of a finished compost product of 10% to 20%.
 
Product Sales. For many compost facilities (especially those that work with biosolids), margins made on tipping fees drive their business model, and little effort or expense is made on producing a quality and consistent end product. For these facilities, limited additional revenue and margin is made on the back end – at times only about 10% to 20% of their revenue is from soil sales. They may give away product to landfills for cover or sell it to farmers for prices between $4 and $8 per cubic yard on average.
 
As mentioned above, one of the more compelling aspects of the compost industry is the trend among certain facilities to view their business less as a waste management solution, and more as a manufacturing process to produce higher end compost and soil products. Management believes this is a fundamental transition in thinking about operations, procedures and priorities. Those facilities that have made the transition to focus on end product may have higher production costs to assure consistency of feedstock, better manufacturing procedures, and greater marketing costs, but the financial benefit can be material. Whereas average low quality compost may sell for $4/yard, high quality products can fetch much higher prices – between $12/yard and $80/yard for the top end soil products.

Business Plan and Value Appreciation Strategy
 
The Company believes that by creating a regional or, ultimately, nationwide footprint of composting facilities that can manufacture consistent, quality product, combined with strong sales and marketing strategies, we can create substantial added value from acquired assets. When combined with a solid acquisition plan backed by the proper financial partners and executed by an experienced team, management believes there is great potential for building a dominant company in this sector over the next two to three years, with further significant growth opportunities in the following years.
 
Product Focus. As discussed above, the Company plans to achieve organic growth by maximizing sales of high end compost and soils through a network of distribution channels. Part of this strategy would include transitioning facilities that are more reliant on tipping fees to better manufacturing processes that can achieve higher quality products. For those facilities that already have these procedures in place, we plan to introduce new branded and blended soils products into their regional markets that command higher prices and margins.
 
Sales Channels/Distribution. Current sales of compost and soils predominately involve selling to one farm at a time / one project at a time. The trend in farmland is moving towards PE and REIT owned assets, which creates the ability to negotiate long-term compost sales with corporate customers, and acquire composters strategically located where these large customers control land. The Company will seek to develop nationwide marketing and sales channels with large corporate customers, government agencies, etc. Marketing is a major component of compost sales that seems to be lacking in the industry and can result in significant strides in organic growth in management’s opinion.
 
The engineered soils market is generally in its early growth stages. Management believes there are substantial opportunities to promote these products for construction, federal/municipal infrastructure programs, and land reclamation/mining projects. As infrastructure projects increase nationwide, as is expected in the current political environment, so will the soils market. The Company plans to invest in sales and marketing to attract nationwide landscape engineering firms, state and municipal planning agencies and other customers that can benefit from and place large orders for engineered soils. To the extent that we can divert more compost to construction and infrastructure projects, we can better grow revenue and margins organically, while always being cognizant of cyclical changes in this market.
 
Efficiencies. Management expects that consolidating composting companies can lead to better operational and sales efficiencies. Activities such as safety, accounting, legal, advertising, lobbying, training and others can be done at the corporate level, thus reducing overlapping personnel and efforts. To create greater efficiencies, the Company’s employee base is expected to include operational experts with successful track records of consolidating operations and cultures in a merger strategy.
 
Letters of Intent and Pending Acquisition Agreements
 
The Company currently has three letters of intent and/or exclusivity agreements with three compost manufacturing companies in Florida, Georgia and Texas. Management is in different stages of due diligence and definitive contract negotiation with these companies, with the intention of having all three companies in a position to close under acquisition in 2018. Management can make no guaranty that these acquisitions will close due to many factors including failure to raise required funding, failure to reach definitive agreements, and findings of items in the diligence process that would make closing not in the best interests of the Company.
 
In additional to the letters of intent, in August 2017 the Company and Environmental Turnkey Solutions LLC (“ETS”) signed a definitive Purchase Agreement to acquire all of the membership interests in ETS. Consideration under the Purchase Agreement includes $2.5 million cash subject to adjustment based on net accounts receivable at closing, $3.5 million in sellers’ notes which are payable to the sellers within nine months of closing, $4.5 million in Q2Earth common stock valued at $0.15 per share, and a $1.5 million stock earnout. The Company will assume approximately $2.5 million in commercial equipment loans and $1.5 million in a real property loan. This agreement was supposed to close in the first quarter of 2018; however, due to items that Management uncovered in due diligence, and the complications such findings caused to our fund raising process, Management provided the owners of ETS with a revised valuation and purchase price offer in the first quarter of 2018. This revised offer has not been accepted to date, and as a result, our Board has decided to defer the closing of this transaction until a later date, if at all.

Composting Industry
 
Size and Composition. According to research conducted by the U.S. Composting Counsel, there are approximately 5,000 commercial composters in the United States diverting an estimated 19.4 million tons of organics from landfills. These organic waste streams primarily consist of yard trimmings, food scraps, biosolids (from waste water treatment plants) and some agricultural waste streams, including manure.
 
Of the approximately 5,000 composting sites in the U.S., most are small producers generating under $1 million per year in revenue. Less than 400 composters in the U.S., by the Company’s count based on industry data, generate more than $5 million in revenue per year, and even few over $10 million.
 
Compost manufacturers can also be segmented by the types of waste they collect for processing. The three main feedstocks are biosolids from waste water treatment plants, yard (or “green”) waste from commercial or municipal waste collection firms, and pre or post-consumer food waste. The largest number of composters utilize green waste, however, the largest volume of compost in the U.S. comes from biosolids.
 
Applications/Sectors for Compost Sales. The applications for agricultural compost and engineered soils are wide and growing. Engineered soils (sometimes called manufactured soils) are blends of soil, soil components and soil-like material used in horticulture, landscape, construction and site restoration applications. Using engineered soils allows for “tailoring” of soil properties to specific needs. Soil blending is performed at a production scale across the U.S., generating millions of cubic yards of product annually. Compost is a primary component of engineered soils, typically comprising 1/3 of its volume.
 
The largest segments for the application of compost and engineered soils include the following:
 
Agriculture. Making farmland more productive and sustainable is the largest application of compost. Compost improves infiltration rates, water holding capacity and soil tilth; and fertilizes the soil to supplement nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Use of compost can save farmers money by decreasing water, chemical fertilizer and pesticide uses by up to 80%. Despite the utilization of compost on farmland being an age-old practice, the market for this in the U.S. is still largely untapped, estimated at only a 10% utilization rate relative to all farmable land, according to the U.S. Composting Council.
 
Construction: For both traditional construction and LEED certified projects, use of engineered soils for control of erosion, water retention, sedimentation and pollution can result in cost savings and easier compliance with permitting. Further, Low Impact Development (LID) approaches – maintaining and enhancing pre-development watershed regimes – have become critically important, especially in urban settings. Engineered soils play a major role in green roofs, bio-retention cells, rain gardens, infiltration trenches and open grid pavement systems. The goals of these systems are to reduce the flow rate, volume and contaminant level of storm water runoff (compost can retain 20X its weight in water).
 
Silviculture and Land Reclamation (Mining): Engineered soils are being used to repopulate forests (silviculture) and other land where heavy use, industry or other activities such as mining have decimated the vegetation. This is an important area to help control water conservation and climate change.
 
Sod and Turf: Engineered soils are being used to improve sod and turf quality, produce a lighter material, and enhance growth efficiency. They are being used for college and high school athletic fields (especially to replace synthetic turf fields), and for golf course construction and maintenance.
 
Competition 
 
The composting industry is highly fragmented with no clear leader on a national basis. As composting is very much a localized business constrained by the costs of transporting soils over long distances, each region or community that we may enter in the future will have a dominant market player. The Company views these local leaders as potential acquisition targets or partners; however, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to acquire or build a dominant business in each location it chooses to enter.

Large waste companies such as Waste Management (“WM”) and Republic Industries own compost facilities in their respective portfolios. WM in particular owns over 40 compost facilities, typically connected to a landfill property. Management believes that these compost sites are under-utilized and not geared to creating the highest value end-products for sale into multiple markets. As a result, we believe there is an opportunity to work with large companies like WM to help them expand their sales and marketing operations.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Compost. With respect to the Company’s future composting business model, we do not hold any specific intellectual property; however, certain of the companies we have identified for acquisition or partnership do have trade secrets in soil formulas, manufacturing processes, and patentable compost additives, all of which could be valuable for our on-going growth strategy.
 
Engine Development. On August 8, 2017, the Company sold the intellectual property developed in connection with the Q2P Engine and the CHP System to Phoenix Power Group, in consideration for value of approximately $162,500 comprised of payment and elimination of certain payments to the Company’s vendors. This intellectual property consisted of designs, drawings, manufacturing processes, and potentially patentable technology, as well as a license agreement with Cyclone Power Technologies.
 
Patents. The Company currently does not hold any patents.
 
Trade Secrets. With respect to proprietary know-how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on among other things, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests. We also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans.
 
Trademarks. We have received approval from the USPTO for use of our Q2P and Q2Power trademarks. We acquired from Cyclone the U.S. trademarks for “WHE”, WHE Generation” and “Generation WHE” in connection with our Separation Agreement. The Company is not currently using any of these marks.
 
Exchange Act 
 
We are subject to the following regulations of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and applicable securities laws, rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act by the SEC. Compliance with these requirements of the Exchange Act increases our legal and accounting costs.
Smaller Reporting Company
 
We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act, and subject to the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K of the SEC, as a “smaller reporting company.” That designation will relieve us of some of the informational requirements of Regulation S-K.
Emerging Growth Company
 
We are also an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or “JOBS Act.” As long as we remain an “emerging growth company,” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not an “emerging growth company,” like those applicable to a “smaller reporting company,” including, but not limited to, a scaled down description of our business in SEC filings; no requirements to include risk factors in Exchange Act filings; no requirement to include certain selected financial data and supplementary financial information in SEC filings; not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements that we file under the Exchange Act; no requirement for Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b) auditor attestations of internal control over financial reporting; and exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and seeking nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We are also only required to file audited financial statements for the previous two fiscal years when filing registration statements, together with reviewed financial statements of any applicable subsequent quarter.

We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” We can remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years. We would cease to be an “emerging growth company” prior to such time if we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more and when we become a “larger accelerated filer,” have a public float of $700 million or more or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.
 
Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 
Sarbanes/Oxley Act
 
Except for the limitations excluded by the JOBS Act discussed under the preceding heading “Emerging Growth Company,” we are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes/Oxley Act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthens auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; management assessment of our internal controls; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; requires companies and auditors to evaluate internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes/Oxley Act will substantially increase our legal and accounting costs.
 
Exchange Act Reporting Requirements
 
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, like we are, to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to shareholders at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our shareholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A (where proxies are solicited) or 14C (where consents in writing to the action have already been received or anticipated to be received) of Regulation 14, as applicable; and preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to our shareholders.
 
We are also required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and will be required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Number of Total Employees and Number of Full Time Employees
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, we have two full-time employees, and one part-time employee.
 
Reports to Security Holders 
 
You may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may also find all of the reports that we have filed electronically with the SEC at their Internet site www.sec.gov.
