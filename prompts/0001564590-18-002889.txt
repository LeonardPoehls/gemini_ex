 Our Company
 We are a leading provider of independent, technology-enabled financial advisory services, discretionary portfolio management, personalized investment advice, financial and retirement income planning, and financial education and guidance.  We help individuals, either online or with an advisor, develop a strategy to reach financial goals by offering a comprehensive set of services, including holistic, personalized plans for saving and investing, assessments of retirement income, and the option to meet face-to-face with a financial advisor at one of more than 140 advisor centers nationwide.  As the burden of retirement investing shifts from employer-sponsored retirement plans to the individual, we believe that there is an increasing need for assistance and guidance on how to invest for retirement wealth. Our advice and planning services cover employer-sponsored defined contribution (DC) accounts (401(k), 457, and 403(b) plans), IRA accounts, and taxable accounts.
 We use our proprietary advice technology platform to provide our services to millions of individual investors, both DC plan participants in the workplace as well as retail investors, on a cost-efficient basis. We believe that our services have significantly increased the accessibility of low-cost, high-quality, independent, personalized portfolio management services, investment advice and financial planning.
 Our business model of comprehensive financial planning is based primarily on providing access to our advisory services through DC plans in the workplace, and expanding that connection to a holistic financial advisory relationship with our clients. We also provide advisory services to individual clients who access our services directly. Clients are defined as individuals who utilize our services, including Professional Management, Personal Advisor, Online Advice, education or guidance. We work with three key constituencies: individual investors, plan sponsors (employers offering DC plans to their employees) and plan providers (companies providing administrative services to plan sponsors). We provide the following benefits for each of these constituencies:
 Individual Investors: For individuals, we provide discretionary portfolio management, personalized investment advice, financial and retirement income planning, financial education and guidance that is free of product conflict.  Individual clients may access our services as DC plan participants in the workplace (as employees of companies offering DC plans) or may choose to access our services as a retail investor directly by meeting with an advisor at one of our more than 140 locations. 
 Plan Sponsors:    For DC plan sponsors, our services are designed to improve employee satisfaction and reduce fiduciary and business risk by evaluating, disclosing and addressing investment and savings decisions by plan participants both before and after retirement.
 Plan Providers:    For DC plan providers, our services can represent a cost-effective method of providing personalized, independent investment advice that can be an attractive and increasingly necessary service for the largest plan sponsors. Providing these services helps plan providers compete more effectively. 
 We deliver our services to plan sponsors and plan participants primarily through connections to nine DC plan providers. We target large plan sponsors across a wide range of industries. For individual retail clients whom we service directly, we deliver services through individual client agreements entered into with our network of investment advisors.

As of December 31, 2017, our services were available to 747 plan sponsors representing approximately 9.8 million participants and approximately $1.22 trillion of assets in DC plans for which we have made our discretionary portfolio service available to eligible prospective clients in the workplace, which we refer to as DC Assets Under Contract, or DC AUC. Our DC AUC does not include assets in plans for which we have signed contracts but have not yet made our discretionary portfolio service available. We do not derive revenue based on DC AUC but believe that DC AUC can be a useful indicator of the additional plan assets available for enrollment efforts that, if successful, would result in these assets becoming AUM. 
 As of December 31, 2017, individual clients enrolled in our discretionary portfolio management services, were over 1,058,000 and we had approximately $169.4 billion in assets under management, or AUM.  AUM is defined as the amount of assets that we manage as part of our discretionary portfolio management services, which includes general portfolio advisory management, as well as the services we market as Professional Management and Personal Advisor.  Our business model is characterized by generating revenue through three primary sources: professional management, platform and other revenue, as discussed below in “Revenue”. 
 Products and Services  
 We provide independent, personalized, technology-enabled financial planning services, including education and guidance, portfolio management, investment advice and retirement income services. Clients primarily access our services through plan providers but may also access services directly at one of our advisor center locations. Our services are available online and through advisors, both in person and over the phone. Financial Engines advisory services available to clients include discretionary portfolio management, online advice, income planning and financial wellness.

 The breadth of our services are described in more detail below. 
 Professional Management. Our Professional Management service provides discretionary portfolio management service for individuals in the workplace who want affordable and personalized portfolio management for their retirement accounts.  The service provides retirement account management and retirement income services from an independent investment advisor without the conflicts of interest that can arise when an advisor offers proprietary products. We developed our Professional Management service to reach a large number of plan participants on a cost-effective basis and assist them on the path to a secure retirement. With this service, which is available to DC participants, we provide discretionary management of the client’s assets and make investment decisions on behalf of the client. When DC plan participants enroll in our Professional Management service, we use our proprietary investment methodologies, which we call our Advice Engines, to create personalized, diversified portfolios and provide ongoing management. Our investment management takes into account the investment alternatives available in the client’s DC plan, including any employer stock, as determined and approved by a plan fiduciary other than us, and can take into account other identified holdings of the plan participant.  
 3

Personal Advisor. Our Personal Advisor service offers discretionary portfolio management for 401(k), IRA and taxable accounts for both DC plan participants and individual retail investors. Clients work with a dedicated advisor to personalize a financial plan that covers accumulation, pre-retirement and retirement phases of planning. Services may cover a wide array of topics – including budget planning, maximizing employer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs, life insurance needs, estate planning, tax optimization, health care, Social Security optimization, retirement planning, and others - that will impact clients’ short-term and long-term financial goals. Clients and advisors stay connected through regular in-person meetings and calls to monitor and take action to help clients stay on track toward meeting their financial goals.  
 Online Advice. Our Online Advice service is an Internet-based investment advisory service designed for individuals who wish to take a more active role in personally managing their portfolios. With this service, individuals may elect to follow the advice without delegating discretionary investment decision-making or trading authority to us, making this a non-discretionary service. This service includes interactive access to simulation and portfolio optimization technologies through our Advice Engines. Individuals see a forecast that shows how likely they are to reach their desired retirement goals, get recommendations on which investments to buy or sell, and simulate how their portfolios might perform under a wide variety of economic scenarios. They can also explore different levels of investment risk, savings amounts and retirement horizons, as well as get tax-efficient advice on accounts other than their DC accounts. The service offers investment advice on the fund options available in a DC plan and can also offer advice on IRA and taxable accounts. Since we began offering the Online Advice service, more than 3.8 million participants have accepted our online services agreement.  
 Financial Planning and Retirement Income Planning. Our services include access to comprehensive goals-based financial planning and retirement income planning services.  Enrolled participants in our Professional Management service receive a retirement plan, which sets out investment allocation and savings actions recommended to achieve a targeted retirement income. The retirement plan reviews annual contribution amounts, shows proposed investment allocations, and forecasts retirement income relative to a retirement goal. Individuals are encouraged to provide their personalized information such as desired financial goals, risk preference and employer stock holding preference, to enable us to create a more personalized financial plan and portfolio allocation. Clients may also have access to create a broader financial plan, which extends the Retirement Plan to cover other financial decisions.  

• | Retirement Income. Our retirement income solutions, including Income+ and Retirement Paycheck, which are features of our Professional Management and Personal Advisor services, respectively, provide clients approaching or in retirement with discretionary portfolio management with an income objective and steady monthly payments from their accounts during retirement, including Social Security claiming guidance and planning. We do not provide the annuity, nor do we receive, accept or charge fees, or pay commissions related to any purchases of insurance products or services related to Income+.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Social Security Planning. Social Security claiming guidance is available online and through registered Investment Advisor Representatives. The service is available at no additional cost to help participants nearing retirement better understand their Social Security claiming options by creating personalized strategies that account for single individuals, divorced individuals, spouses, multiple income sources and realistic life expectancies. A Social Security planner is also available to the public on our website at no charge. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Financial Wellness. A wide range of financial education and guidance delivered through multiple channels, including on-site events, online content and phone-based advisors. 
  
• | Education and Guidance. We provide educational content and guidance on a broad range of financial wellness-related topics. The content and guidance are delivered through live events, interactive online tools and advisor access. These services are available at no additional cost to participants at select plan sponsors as well as to prospective clients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Retirement Evaluation. We typically provide each eligible DC plan participant with a Retirement Evaluation or similar retirement readiness assessment to highlight specific risks in the plan participant’s retirement account, provide guidance on how to reduce those risks and introduce our services as a means of obtaining help in addressing these issues. Specifically, the evaluation considers key aspects of how the individual plan participant is using the 401(k) account, typically including investment decisions (risk, diversification, employer stock concentration) and contribution rate. We continue to implement the integration of personalized online assessments of certain types of investing risks into plan providers’ websites. This integration allows participants who log onto the provider website to view personalized assessments of their portfolio online and to learn more about our services. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advisor Access. Clients may choose to use our services through an in-person advisor. Advisors are able to answer questions and provide education on a range of financial topics. The advisor confirms the client’s financial goals, reviews the client’s financial plan and helps the clients make desired adjustments. Subadvisory DC plan providers also maintain call centers to support participants in the plans record-kept by that provider. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Revenue 
We generate our revenue through three primary sources: professional management, platform and other revenue.
 Professional Management.    We derive professional management revenue from client fees paid by or on behalf of both DC and individual investor clients who are enrolled in one of our discretionary portfolio management services (either the Professional Management or the Personal Advisor service) for the management of their account assets. We continue to use the term professional management revenue to include revenue from both the Professional Management and Personal Advisor services. Our arrangements with clients using discretionary portfolio management services generally provide for fees based on the value of assets we manage and are generally payable quarterly in arrears. The majority of client fees across both services, as well as across both advisory and subadvisory relationships for DC accounts, are calculated on a monthly basis, as the product of client fee rates and the value of assets under management (AUM) at or near the end of each month. For IRA and taxable accounts, our client fees are calculated on a quarterly basis at the end of each quarter. 
 Platform.    We derive platform revenue from recurring, subscription-based fees for access to our services, including Online Advice, education and guidance. The arrangements generally provide for fees to be paid by the plan sponsor, plan provider or the DC plan itself, depending on the plan structure. Platform revenue is generally paid annually or quarterly in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period beginning after the completion of customer setup and data connectivity. 
 Other.    Other revenue includes reimbursement for a portion of marketing and client materials from certain subadvisory relationships, and for the year ended December 31, 2016, fees for non-retirement account servicing and franchise royalty fees. As we have acquired all franchises, we no longer have franchise royalty revenue after October 2016.
 None of our fees are based on investment performance or other incentive arrangements. Our fees generally are based on AUM, which is influenced by market performance. Our fees are not based on a share of the capital gains or appreciation in a client’s account. 
 Our total revenue was $310.7 million, $423.9 million and $480.5 million for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. We generated professional management revenue of $277.2 million, $385.9 million and $450.3 million for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively and we generated platform revenue of $30.8 million, $28.4 million and $26.6 million for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. We have historically earned, and expect to continue to earn on a consolidated basis, a significant portion of our revenue through our subadvisory relationships. Please refer to the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section for additional revenue information.

Investment Process and Methodology  
 Our goal is to apply investment techniques traditionally available only to large, sophisticated investors to help individual investors achieve their retirement goals. Our advice services incorporate several of the methodologies developed by our co-founder and economics Nobel Laureate, Professor William F. Sharpe. We use Monte Carlo simulation and proprietary optimization techniques to provide cost-effective, sophisticated and personalized advice that is free from product conflict. Monte Carlo simulation is widely used in investment management and is a statistical technique in which many simulations of an uncertain quantity are run to model the distribution of possible outcomes. 
 Workplace DC Services.   When providing simulations and investment recommendations, our methodology evaluates a variety of factors that impact investment returns, including fees, portfolio turnover, management performance, tax-efficiency, and a fund’s investment style where we identify the underlying asset class exposures and active management risk associated with asset allocation changes by a fund manager in response to market conditions and decisions to weight specific security holdings differently than comparable indices. By modeling the characteristics of specific investment alternatives, we are able to provide quantitative estimates of possible future outcomes and make investment recommendations. We are also able to model the complexities found in large DC plans and to provide investment advice to plan participants that can be implemented within the limits of a given plan’s available options.
 Unlike traditional advisory services, our workplace services do not rely on the subjective evaluation of each plan participant’s portfolio by a human investment advisor. Instead, our services rely on Advice Engines (described below under “Investment Technology”) that accept inputs on available investment choices along with a variety of personal information including investment objective, risk tolerance, investment horizon, age, savings, outside personal assets, investor preferences and tax considerations. 
 Our investment recommendations for workplace accounts are limited to the investment alternatives available in a 401(k) plan, although we do take into account other identified holdings of the plan participant when offering investment advice. With the exception of employer stock, if any, included as an investment alternative, we do not provide advice on or manage single-company securities. 
 We offer no proprietary investment products, which keeps us free of the conflicts of interest, or the perceptions of conflicts of interest, that can arise for competitors who offer such products. We do not receive differential compensation based on the investments we recommend. For our workplace clients, we do not hold assets in custody or execute trades. 
 For clients with the Income+ feature enabled, the investment portfolios are structured to provide the potential for steady income payouts throughout retirement.   To accomplish this objective, the Income+ optimization approach divides the portfolio into three components: fixed income, an op
tional purchase of an annuity outside of the plan, and equities. We do not provide annuities or other financial products to any Income+ clients. Over time, the equities are gradually converted into additional fixed income assets to support a higher floor level of income.
 Services Offered Directly to Retail Investors. We provide retail clients with two primary asset management services: the standard service and the Retirement Paycheck service.  We manage client accounts on a discretionary basis, and the management of those accounts is guided by the stated objective(s) of the client. These objectives may include, generally, growth, income, or a combination of these. The investment products recommended for both services are usually actively and/or passively managed mutual funds and/or exchange-traded funds. For the Retirement Paycheck service, fixed income investments are also recommended, and may include highly-rated bonds, FDIC insured certificates of deposit and U.S. government issued or guaranteed securities.
 While we may and can provide investment recommendations on other securities, including equity securities, U.S. government securities, corporate and municipal bonds and variable life insurance and annuities, our focus is on mutual funds and/or exchange-traded funds. We direct custodians to execute trades on behalf of our direct individual clients, whose assets are held in custodial accounts by third parties. 
 6

Advisors at our branch locations provide advice for individual accounts using asset allocation strategies into mutual funds and ETFs researched and selected by our investment management team. The advisor creates a portfolio based on a selection of several core asset allocation models to fit client needs. The portfolios span the risk spectrum from highly conservative to aggressive, and allocation models are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Additionally, there are a limited number of specialized allocation models for specific situations such as Retirement Paycheck. Our investment management team manages the various asset allocation models, including the oversight of, and selection of, funds. 
 Investment Technology
 We believe high-quality advisory services should be offered to all individuals regardless of wealth. As of December 31, 2017, the median assets under management for all Professional Management service clients was approximately $69,000. Because we service numerous accounts of varying sizes, achieving our objective requires significant scalability to achieve an affordable cost to the investment manager. Our scalable technology has continued to deliver flexibility and results as our business has grown.
 Workplace Services.  Our Advice Engines consist of two main components: a Simulation Engine and an Optimization Engine. In the course of our development, we have received U.S. patents that relate to various parts of our financial advisory platform, including patents that apply specifically to the Advice Engines.
 Workplace Services-Simulation Engine.    We have developed a Monte Carlo Simulation Engine that provides plan participants with a view of the potential range of future values of their retirement investments. The Simulation Engine helps plan participants reach informed decisions about the appropriate level of risk, savings and time horizon to improve the likelihood of achieving financial goals. Our Simulation Engine is capable of:

• | modeling more than 37,000 securities, including retail mutual funds, stocks, employee stock options, institutional funds, guaranteed investment contracts and stable value funds, exchange-traded funds and fixed-income securities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | considering security-specific characteristics such as investment style, expenses, turnover, manager performance, and security-specific and industry risk;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | forecasting the total household portfolio, including tax-deferred and taxable accounts;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | incorporating social security, pension income and other retirement benefits; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | presenting outcomes in terms of portfolio value or retirement income.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Workplace DC Services-Optimization Engine.    We use our Optimization Engine to construct personalized portfolios. Our Optimization Engine takes into consideration the costs, quality and investment styles of the specific investment alternatives available to a plan participant. Specifically, our investment recommendations take into consideration for each fund the mix of asset class exposures, fund expenses, turnover, fund-specific risk due to active management, manager performance and consistency, user-imposed constraints and tax efficiency, where applicable, to construct a personalized portfolio recommendation for each client. 
 When constructing a portfolio during the accumulation phase, our Optimization Engine:
  
• | supports dynamic, specific, product-level buy and sell recommendations for Online Advice, which can be readily executed, and automated transactions for the Professional Management service;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | creates recommended portfolios from the available investment alternatives, such as retail mutual funds, institutional funds and employer stock, in the case of a 401(k) plan, or from either the entire universe of more than 25,000 retail mutual funds, or a subset thereof, in the case of taxable or other tax-deferred accounts;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | creates recommendations across multiple taxable and tax-deferred accounts;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 7

 
• | takes into consideration investment objective, investor risk preferences, restricted positions, redemption fees, investor constraints and outside account information provided to us to create personalized investment recommendations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | for assets held in taxable accounts, considers the impact of personal tax rates, unrealized capital gains and losses, the tax efficiency of specific investment options including the propensity to distribute capital gains and income distributions and the benefit of optimal asset placement to maximize after-tax investment returns; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enables real-time interaction with plan participants allowing them to partially override certain types of recommendations and immediately receive updated advice reflecting these constraints.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 When managing a portfolio during the income phase, our Optimization Engine:
  
• | creates structured 401(k) portfolios of fixed income and equities that enable the generation of steady income payouts that can last for life, and can go up with the market; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | takes into consideration fund expenses, bond durations, asset class style exposures, and changes in interest rates to create dynamic portfolios that support steady income payouts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our systems assess a plan participant’s portfolio through a variety of market conditions including variation in inflation, interest rates, and dividends. 
 Services Offered Directly to Retail Investors. For our services offered directly, we use institutional asset management analytics and third-party vendors (such as FactSet Research Services, Bloomberg, or Morningstar Direct), and proprietary research processes for portfolio construction, performance and risk measurement, contribution and decomposition in both the investment strategy due diligence process and portfolio/allocation construction process.
 We use these tools in combination with research and analysis that leverages institutional research providers (such as CornerstoneMacro, EvercoreISI and Bespoke Investment Group) to supplement capital market and macroeconomic data that helps inform risk management and asset allocation decisions. With the combination of the investment due diligence, asset class research and analysis, and capital market and economic assessments, we create portfolios and allocations for advisors to use with clients.
 Our advisor representatives then use third-party financial planning technology and software and direct, personal relationships with clients to match clients with the appropriate portfolios and asset allocations given the clients’ goals and objectives and their willingness and ability to accept risk.
 Research and Development
 Research and development expense includes costs associated with defining and specifying new features and ongoing enhancement to our Advice Engines and other aspects of our service offerings, financial research, quality assurance, related administration and other costs that do not qualify for capitalization. Costs in this area are primarily related to employee compensation for our investment research, product development and engineering personnel and related expenses and, to a lesser extent, related external consulting expenses.
 Research and development expenses were $35.6 million, $38.0 million and $44.0 million for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.

Customers and Key Relationships
 Individual Clients. For individuals, we provide discretionary portfolio management, personalized investment advice, financial and retirement income planning, financial education and guidance that is free of product conflict. Our services include our Professional Management, Personal Advisor, or Online Advice services. DC plan participants in the workplace gain access to our services through their DC plan provider platforms or online directly with us, pursuant to agreements between us and the applicable plan sponsor and in accordance with the terms and conditions that apply to the services. Retail investors who choose to access our discretionary portfolio management directly have the option to meet with an advisor face-to-face at one of our more than 140 locations.  In direct client relationships with retail investors, we contract directly with the client, including any consents required by a third-party custodian, to enable our advisors to direct securities transactions on their behalf.  
 Plan Sponsors.    We define plan sponsors as employers across a range of industries who offer defined contribution plans to employees. No more than 4% of our revenue was associated with any one plan sponsor for the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the average annual sponsor retention over the last three years was 96%. The average annual AUM retention rate over the same period was 97%, which represents the average ratio of AUM from all sponsors as of January 1st versus the same AUM for those sponsors who were retained as of December 31st of each of the last three years. When providing advisory services directly as not as subadvisor, we enter into contracts with plan sponsors. These contracts are typically for an initial three- or five-year term and continue thereafter unless terminated. Under these contracts, at any time during the initial term or thereafter, the plan sponsor can cancel a contract for fiduciary reasons or breach of contract and can generally terminate a contract after the initial term upon 90 days’ notice.
 Plan Providers.    We define plan providers as the administrators and record-keepers of defined contribution, or DC, plans. In consultation with plan sponsors, plan providers make available a range of investment alternatives through DC plans to individual participants. We work with plan providers to make available discretionary portfolio management and other investment advisory services to the participants in the DC plans of plan sponsors. We deliver our services to plan sponsors and plan participants primarily through existing connections with nine DC plan providers. Our contracts with plan providers generally have terms ranging from three to five years, and have successive automatic renewal terms of one year unless terminated in accordance with prior notice requirements. A majority of these provider agreements are in renewal periods. In addition, a plan provider may terminate its contract with us at any time for specified breaches. We maintain two types of relationships with our plan providers: 

• | Direct Advisory Relationships. In these relationships, we are the primary advisor and a plan fiduciary. Data is shared between the plan providers and us via data connections. In addition, our sales teams directly engage plan sponsors, although, in some cases, we have formed and are executing a joint sales and collaborative marketing strategy with the plan provider. We have separate contracts with both the plan sponsor and plan provider, and pay fees to the plan provider for facilitating the exchange of plan and plan participant data as well as implementing our transaction instructions for client accounts. Plan providers with whom we have direct advisory relationships are Alight Financial Services (formerly known as Aon Hewitt), Conduent (formerly known as Xerox), Fidelity, Transamerica, T. Rowe Price, and Wells Fargo. In addition, we have limited connections with Charles Schwab and Northwest Plan Services. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Subadvisory Relationships. In these relationships, the plan provider is the primary advisor and plan fiduciary and we act in a subadvisory capacity. Our contract is with the plan provider and not the plan sponsor. We offer our co-branded services under the plan provider’s brand, with the services typically identified as “powered by Financial Engines.” Revenue is collected by the plan provider who then pays a subadvisory fee to us. We have subadvisory relationships with Alight Financial Advisors, Empower RetirementTM, Vanguard, and Voya. The Alight Financial Advisors subadvisory relationship excludes those sponsors currently under contract with us for a direct advisory relationship. We have historically earned, and expect to continue to earn on a consolidated basis, a significant portion of our revenue through subadvisory relationships with DC plan providers. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2017, Alight Financial Advisors accounted for 10% of our total revenue.

Sales and Marketing
 Our sales and marketing team seeks to increase assets we manage, primarily by adding clients. Our marketing approach is to develop familiarity, trust, and relationships with individual investors, so that we are a natural partner when individuals begin exploring financial help. We seek to build this relationship by being helpful, providing ongoing communication of educational content, basic financial planning modules, and easy access to advisors. We complement this relationship marketing approach by remaining accessible with our phone-based National Advisor Center and our digital website that is accessible from a plan sponsor’s intranet and plan provider’s website.  The locations of many of our advisor centers are also aligned with the locations where our DC participants are geographically clustered.  
Marketing to Individual Clients:
  
• | Marketing to DC plan participants in the workplace. In the workplace, we must establish relationships and data connections with plan providers, and obtain contracts with plan sponsors to make our services available to their plan participants. Once a DC plan has been set up on our systems and our services have been made available to plan participants, we then conduct ongoing communications and undertake promotional activities to encourage use of our services. These efforts typically include printed or electronic Retirement Evaluations, email notifications, website integration and other forms of online engagement. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also conduct an annual communications campaign in conjunction with plan sponsors to deliver a retirement readiness assessment, which highlights specific risks in a participant’s retirement account, provide guidance on how to reduce those risks, and introduce our services as a means of obtaining help in addressing these issues. We typically undertake promotional activities in conjunction with these annual campaigns to incent trial use of the service.  In addition, throughout the year, we send communications to engage participants on various financial topics in an effort to build deeper relationships with current and prospective clients. 
 When a plan sponsor first rolls out our services, the sponsor can choose an active enrollment campaign, in which a plan participant must affirmatively sign up for the Professional Management service, or a passive enrollment campaign, in which a plan participant will become a client of the Professional Management service unless the individual declines the service. Passive enrollment campaigns achieve higher enrollment results at lower acquisition cost per client than do active enrollment campaigns. We may eliminate or reduce our platform fees, as well as reduce the fees payable by plan participants, depending upon the scope of services and methodologies we are able to use, such as passive enrollment. Once a DC plan participant enrolls in our Professional Management service, the retirement assets of that plan participant count toward our AUM.
  
• | Marketing to retail investors. We use a range of channels to reach current and prospective individual retail clients, including digital marketing, affinity programs, hosted live events and seminars, as well as a weekly syndicated radio show called Investing Sense. Once a Personal Advisor client deposits assets into his or her account, those assets count toward our AUM.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Establishing Relationships and Connections with Plan Providers.    We rely on direct sales to create contractual relationships with plan providers. Following contract signing, technical teams from Financial Engines and the plan provider initiate a data connection project that typically takes between four months and one year to complete. Once we have incurred this one-time, up-front cost to establish a relationship and connection with a plan provider, we are able to roll out our services for any plan sponsor of that plan provider.
 10

Obtaining Contracts with Plan Sponsors.    Either Financial Engines or, in the case of a subadvisory relationship, the plan provider, must obtain a contract with a plan sponsor before we can make available our Professional Management or Online Advice services to that plan sponsor’s participants. We market our services to plan sponsors in the following manner:
  
• | Direct to Plan Sponsor. In the case of direct advisory relationships, we pursue a direct sales strategy with plan sponsors. Our direct sales team’s efforts are supported by an institutional services team that engages in sales efforts with existing plan sponsors. The direct sales and institutional services teams are supported by a marketing team that seeks to generate demand for our services through public relations, industry events, plan provider specific marketing programs and sales support in the field. We intend to sell our services to plan sponsors that are not current clients but are serviced by the plan providers with whom we have relationships. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sell through the Retirement Plan Provider. Where we have a subadvisory relationship with the plan provider, we provide a combination of primary and secondary sales and marketing support depending on the plan sponsor opportunity. Together with the plan provider, we develop a joint sales and rollout plan in which our relationship managers and direct sales team support the plan provider. This distribution model enables us to reach plan sponsors efficiently, while providing consistent and independent investment advice to plan participants. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Service Delivery and Systems
 Our service delivery team is responsible for the rollout, operation and support of our Professional Management, Personal Advisor and Online Advice services in the workplace. The key steps associated with delivering our services in the workplace include contracting with the plan sponsor, obtaining plan and plan participant data and setting up the plan on our system. 
 For DC plan participants in the workplace, our client implementations team is responsible for project management and the steps involved in setting up and rolling out our services to a plan sponsor. This includes learning the specifics of each plan sponsor’s plan(s), including the fund lineup, fees, matching rules, associated defined benefit, non-qualified and other plans, configuring the plan specifics using our plan sponsor configuration tool, verifying the implementation and approving the commencement of enrollment efforts. The team also oversees the preparation and production of enrollment materials for each participant in the plan. Once a sponsor is set up and rolled out, our client implementations team is also responsible for maintenance of each sponsor’s ongoing plan updates as directed by our account managers and/or subadvisory record-keepers.
 The operations team is responsible for data processing and validation of prospect data for new sponsor rollouts and annual campaigns, as well as the ongoing servicing of clients. These client servicing responsibilities include client data load and verification, the coordination and oversight of all printed materials and electronic communications, transaction processing and reconciliation, fee processing and reconciliation and quarterly sponsor report generation.  
 Our National Advisor Center in Phoenix, Arizona is staffed with registered investment advisor representatives. These advisors service participants through phone and email channels by providing guidance to plan participants, enrollment, and personalization of the participant’s financial profile. Our registered investment advisor representatives and certain call center personnel of the plan providers with whom we work have access to the Financial Engines Professional Advisor, our proprietary client relationship management application, which enables the advisor to edit or add to the personal information used to manage the client’s portfolio allocation. Our services are deployed using industry-standard hardware, software and third-party solutions. We have off-site back-up facilities for our database and network equipment, a disaster recovery plan and on-going third-party security audits to secure the integrity of our systems. We evaluate and improve our systems based on measures of availability, system response time and processing capacity. 
 11

For retail investors, the key steps associated with delivering our services directly include learning about the client’s current financial state and risk preferences using questionnaires and a third-party financial planning solution.  An investment advisor representative or client service manager provides disclosure and oversees the preparation of custodial account and asset transfer paperwork.  After the client’s account paperwork is processed by the custodian, the advisor works to establish a personal relationship with the client, build a comprehensive financial plan, and then monitor and adjust the portfolio to help the client reach financial goals. Retail clients receive a quarterly statement.  
 Competition 
 We operate in a highly competitive industry, with many investment advice providers competing for business from individual investors, financial advisors and institutional customers. Direct competitors who offer independent portfolio management and investment advisory services to plan participants in the workplace include GuidedChoice and Morningstar. Plan providers that offer directly competing portfolio management and investment advisory services to investors in the workplace include Fidelity. Some plan providers with whom we have relationships also provide, or may provide, competing services or products, which may strain our relationship with these plan providers and could result in less favorable contract terms or contract cancellations. 
 Retail competitors include financial institutions, such as Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Edward Jones, Fidelity, and Vanguard, insurance companies, such as MetLife and New York Life, and other registered investment advisors such as Creative Planning, Edelman Financial Services, and Fisher Investments. Emerging competitors include firms that provide portfolio management services delivered primarily through online channels with minimal human interaction such as Betterment, Personal Capital, and Wealthfront (some of which also provide bundled services to the small retirement plan market).
We also face indirect competition from products that could potentially be substitutes for our portfolio management services, investment advice and retirement income services, most notably target-date retirement funds. Target-date funds are offered by multiple financial institutions, such as Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, Wells Fargo, Voya and Empower RetirementTM funds.  In addition, competitors to our retirement income features include providers of retirement income products in the defined contribution market, such as Prudential, AllianceBernstein, and other providers of insurance products. 
 We believe the competitive factors in our industry include:
  
• | ability to provide independent, systemic portfolio management, investment advice and retirement income services based on widely recognized financial economic theory without product conflicts of interest;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to provide holistic, comprehensive advice across an individual’s 401(k), IRA and taxable accounts;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | nationwide branch network of registered investment advisor representatives;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established investment methodology and technology that allows for personalized, scalable advice across a range of account sizes;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | value for fees;
--+----------------


• | proprietary methodologies;
--+---------------------------


• | established relationships with plan providers and plan sponsors; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reputation and experience serving investors.
--+---------------------------------------------

 We believe we currently compete favorably with respect to these factors.

Regulation
 We derive nearly all of our revenue from our investment advisory subsidiary Financial Engines Advisors L.L.C., or FEA. Our investment advisory and management business is subject to extensive, complex and rapidly changing federal and state laws and regulations. FEA is registered as an investment advisor with the SEC and is subject to examination by the SEC. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, referred to as the Advisers Act, and related regulations impose numerous obligations and restrictions on registered investment advisers including fiduciary duties, record keeping requirements, operational requirements, marketing requirements and disclosure obligations.
 The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings for violations of the Advisers Act, and to impose fines and sanctions, including disgorgement of fees or profits, reimbursement for losses, limiting, restricting or prohibiting a registered investment adviser from carrying on its business, or requiring a registered investment adviser to change its business practices or disclosure, in the event that a registered investment adviser fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with the requirements of the Advisers Act or the related SEC rules and interpretations, or other relevant legal provisions could have a material adverse effect on us. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with SEC requirements under the Advisers Act and other applicable laws and regulations. Some of our executives and other employees are registered Investment Adviser Representatives with various states through the Investment Adviser Registration Depository and are subject in some states to examination requirements.
 FEA and our other registered investment advisor subsidiary are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, referred to as ERISA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, with respect to investment advisory and management services provided to participants in DC plans covered by ERISA and is also subject to state laws applicable to DC plans not covered by ERISA. We are a fiduciary under ERISA. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, referred to as the Code, impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients. We rely on certain regulatory interpretations and guidance in connection with our current business model, including regulations and guidance relating to passive enrollment of participants into our Professional Management service. We provide subadvisory services pursuant to the Department of Labor’s Advisory Opinion 2001-09A. The failure of FEA or our other registered investment advisor subsidiaries to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us. The Department of Labor is authorized to institute proceedings for violations of ERISA. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with ERISA.
 We are also subject to state and federal regulations related to privacy, data use and security. These rules require that we develop, implement and maintain written, comprehensive information security programs including safeguards that are appropriate to our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. In recent years, there has been a heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security, including requiring consumer notification in the event of a data breach. Legislation has been introduced in Congress and there have been several Congressional hearings addressing these issues. From time to time, Congress has considered and may do so again, legislation establishing requirements for data security and response to data breaches that, if implemented, could affect us by increasing our costs of doing business. In addition, several states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach. Several other states are considering similar legislation.

In recent years, there has been a heightened legislative and regulatory focus on the financial services industry, including revised rules that redefine and expand what constitutes an ERISA fiduciary, call for creation of a self-regulatory framework for investment advisors similar to the regulatory structure that currently exists for broker/dealers through the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, elimination of pre-dispute arbitration clauses, additional fee disclosures, and the imposition of additional qualification requirements on investment advisors providing services to ERISA plan clients. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, referred to as the Dodd-Frank Act, included various financial reform proposals that may affect investment advisers, including FEA. Although some implementing rules and regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act are still pending, it is expected that the compliance costs and liability risks for investment advisers will increase.
 Rigorous legal and compliance analysis of our business is important to our culture. Our General Counsel supervises our compliance group, which is responsible for addressing all regulatory and compliance matters that affect our investment advisory activities.
 Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property. We seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors, plan sponsors and plan providers that generally provide that any confidential or proprietary information developed by us or on our behalf be kept confidential. We have proprietary know-how in software development, implementation and testing methodologies. We also pursue the registration of certain of our trademarks and service marks in the United States and other countries. We have registered the mark “Financial Engines” in Australia, China, the European Community, Hong Kong, Japan, Russia, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tunisia, and the United States. The sun and clouds design, “Investor Central” and “Retirement Help for Life” trademarks are registered in the United States. We also own the trademarks “Fin Engines,” the FE stylized company logo, and the insurance product logo, all of which are in the process of being registered in the U.S. We also own, through the acquisition of The Mutual Fund Store, the following registered (U.S.) trademarks: “Annuity Optimizer,” “Investing Sense,” “M The Mutual Fund Store & design”, M logos (color and black-and-white), “Market Reentry Plan,” “Retirement Paycheck,” “Smart401K,” “Someday Is Not A Day Of The Week,” “Th
e Mutual Fund Show,” “The Mutual Fund Store,” and “We Work Hard For Hardworking People.” In addition, we have registered our domain name, www.FinancialEngines.com.  As of December 31, 2017, we have five issued U.S. patents in the following categories: load-aware optimization; tax-aware asset allocation; advice palatability and retirement income planning and payout generation. We also have one issued patent in Australia. These patents have expiration dates ranging from September 11, 2018 to August 1, 2031. 
Cybersecurity
 We have designed and implemented and continue to maintain a security program consisting of policies, procedures, and technology meant to maintain the privacy, security and integrity of information, systems, and networks. Among other things, the program includes controls designed to limit and monitor access to authorized systems, networks, and data, prevent inappropriate access or modification, and monitor for threats or vulnerability. Data and assets are categorized based on their sensitivity, and protected accordingly. Subject to customary exclusions and limitations, we also maintain cyber and technology liability insurance, which provides coverage for damages related to data breaches or similar intrusions.  
Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 935 full-time equivalent employees including employees in service delivery, advisor centers, investment management, product development and engineering, sales and marketing, and general and administrative management. We consider relations with our employees to be good and have never experienced a work stoppage. None of our employees are either represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
