GENERAL
 Fauquier Bankshares, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia on January 13, 1984. The Company is a registered bank holding company and owns all of the voting shares of The Fauquier Bank (the “Bank”). The Company engages in its business through the Bank, a Virginia state-chartered bank that commenced operations in 1902. The Company has no significant operations other than owning the stock of the Bank.
THE FAUQUIER BANK
 The Bank’s general market area principally includes Fauquier County, Prince William County and neighboring communities, and is located approximately 50 miles southwest of Washington, D.C. The Bank provides a range of consumer and commercial banking services to individuals, businesses and industries. As of January 1, 2018, the Bank had 11 full service branch offices and approximately 12 automated teller machines (“ATM”) located throughout its market area.
 
The basic services offered by the Bank include: interest and noninterest-bearing demand deposit accounts, money market deposit accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal (“NOW”) accounts, time deposits, safe deposit services, automated teller machines (“ATM”), debit and credit cards, cash management, direct deposits, notary services, night depository, prepaid debit cards, cashier’s checks, domestic and international collections, automated teller services, drive-in tellers, mobile and internet banking, telephone banking, and banking by mail. In addition, the Bank makes secured and unsecured commercial and real estate loans, issues stand-by letters of credit and grants available credit for installment, unsecured and secured personal loans, residential mortgages and home equity loans, as well as automobile and other types of consumer financing. The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).  The Bank provides ATM cards, as a part of the Maestro, Accel - Exchange, and Plus ATM networks, thereby permitting customers to utilize the convenience of larger ATM networks. The Bank also is a member of the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) and Insured Cash Sweep Service (“ICS”), to provide customers multi-million dollar FDIC insurance on certificate of deposit investments and deposit sweeps through the transfer and/or exchange with other FDIC insured institutions. CDARS and ICS are registered service marks of Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC.
 
The Bank operates a Wealth Management Services (“WMS” or “Wealth Management”) division that began with the granting of trust powers to the Bank in 1919. The WMS division provides personalized services that include investment management, financial planning, trust, estate settlement, retirement, insurance, and brokerage services.
 
The Bank, through its subsidiary Fauquier Bank Services, Inc., has equity ownership interests in Bankers Insurance, LLC, a Virginia independent insurance company, Bankers Title Shenandoah, LLC, a title insurance company, and Infinex Investments, Inc., a full service broker/dealer. Bankers Insurance and Bankers Title Shenandoah are owned by a consortium of Virginia community banks, and Infinex is owned by banks and banking associations in various states.
 
The revenues of the Bank are primarily derived from interest on, and fees received in connection with, real estate and other loans, and from interest and dividends from investment and mortgage-backed securities, and short-term investments. The principal sources of funds for the Bank’s lending activities are its deposits, repayment of loans, the sale and maturity of investment securities, and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB”). Additional revenues are derived from fees for deposit-related and WMS-related services. The Bank’s principal expenses are salaries and benefits and occupancy expense.
 
As is the case with banking institutions generally, the Bank’s operations are materially and significantly influenced by general economic conditions and by related monetary and fiscal policies of financial institution regulatory agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”). As a Virginia-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve, the Bank is supervised and examined by the Federal Reserve and the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the Virginia State Corporation Commission (“SCC”). Interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest influence deposit flows and costs of funds. Lending activities are affected by the demand for financing of real estate and other types of loans, which in turn is affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting local demand and availability of funds. The Bank faces strong competition in the attraction of deposits (its primary source of lendable funds) and in the origination of loans. See “Competition” below.
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had total consolidated assets of $644.6 million, total consolidated loans net of allowance for loan losses of $497.7 million, total consolidated deposits of $570.0 million, and total consolidated shareholders’ equity of $56.1 million.
 
LENDING ACTIVITIES
 The Bank offers a range of lending services, including real estate and commercial loans, to individuals as well as small-to-medium sized businesses and other organizations that are located in or conduct a substantial portion of their business in the Bank’s market area. The Bank’s total net loans, at December 31, 2017, were $497.7 million, or 77.2% of total assets. The interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk, maturity, and amount of the loan, and are further subject to competitive pressures, money market rates, availability of funds and government regulations. The Bank has no foreign loans, sub-prime loans or loans for highly leveraged transactions.
 
The Bank’s general market area for lending consists of Fauquier and Prince William Counties, Virginia and the neighboring communities. There is no assurance that this area will experience economic growth. Deteriorating economic conditions in Fauquier or Prince William Counties, as well as declines in the market value of local commercial and/or residential real estate may have an adverse effect on the Company and the Bank.
 
The Bank’s loans are concentrated in the following areas: residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, construction and land loans, commercial and industrial loans, consumer loans, and U.S. Government guaranteed student loans. The majority of the Bank’s loans are made on a secured basis. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 92.0% of the loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by mortgages on real estate.

LOANS SECURED BY REAL ESTATE
 1- 4 FAMILY RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE. The Bank’s 1-4 family residential real estate loan portfolio primarily consists of conventional loans, generally with fixed interest rates with 15 or 30 year terms, and balloon loans with fixed interest rates, and 3, 5, 7, or 10-year maturities utilizing amortization schedules of 30 years or less. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank’s 1-4 family residential loans amounted to $187.1 million, or 37.2% of the total loan portfolio. The majority of the Bank’s single-family residential mortgage loans are secured by properties located in the Bank’s market area. The Bank requires private mortgage insurance if the principal amount of the loan exceeds 80% of the value of the property held as collateral.
 
HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT. The Bank’s home equity lines of credit loan portfolio primarily consists of conventional loans, generally with variable interest rates that are tied to the Wall Street Journal prime rate with 10 year terms. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank’s home equity loans amounted to $44.5 million, or 8.9% of the total loan portfolio. The majority of the Bank’s home equity lines of credit are secured by properties located in the Bank’s market area. The Bank allows a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 85% of the value of the property held as collateral at the time of origination.
 
CONSTRUCTION AND LAND. The majority of the Bank’s construction and land loans are made to individuals to construct a primary residence. Such loans have a maximum term of twelve months, a fixed rate of interest, and loan-to-value ratios of 80% or less of the appraised value upon completion. The Bank requires that permanent financing, with the Bank or some other lender, be in place prior to closing any construction loan. Construction loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than single-family residential mortgage loans. The risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property’s value at completion. The Bank also provides construction loans and lines of credit to developers. Such loans generally have maximum loan-to-value ratios of 80% of the appraised value upon completion. The loans are made with a fixed rate of interest. The majority of construction loans are made to selected local developers for the building of single-family dwellings on either a pre-sold or speculative basis. The Bank limits the number of unsold units under construction at one time. Loan proceeds are disbursed in stages after inspections of the project indicate that such disbursements are for costs already incurred and that have added to the value of the project. Construction loans include loans to developers to acquire the necessary land, develop the site and construct the residential units. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank’s construction and land loans totaled $54.2 million, or 10.8% of the total loan portfolio, which includes $17.1 million of commercial acquisition and development loans, $25.4 million of raw land loans and $1.3 million of agricultural land loans.
 
COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE. Loans secured by commercial real estate comprised $176.8 million, or 35.2% of total loans at December 31, 2017, and consist principally of commercial loans for which real estate constitutes a source of collateral. Approximately $85.5 million or 48.4% of commercial real estate loans are owner-occupied. Commercial real estate loans generally involve a greater degree of risk than single-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of commercial real estate loans may be more vulnerable to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.
 
COMMERCIAL LOANS
 The Bank’s commercial loans include loans to individuals and small-to-medium sized businesses located primarily in Fauquier and Prince William Counties for working capital, equipment purchases, and various other business purposes. Equipment or similar assets secure approximately 92.7% of the Bank’s commercial loans, on a dollar-value basis, and the remaining 7.3% of commercial loans are on an unsecured basis. Commercial loans have variable or fixed rates of interest. Commercial lines of credit are typically granted on a one-year basis. Other commercial loans with terms or amortization schedules longer than one year will normally carry interest rates that vary with the prime lending rate and other financial indices and will be payable in full in three to five years.
 
Loan originations are derived from a number of sources, including existing customers and borrowers, walk-in customers, advertising, and direct solicitation by the Bank’s loan officers. Certain credit risks are inherent in originating and keeping loans on the Bank’s balance sheet. These include interest rate and prepayment risks, risks resulting from uncertainties in the future value of collateral, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers. In particular, longer maturities increase the risk that economic conditions will change and adversely affect the Bank's ability to collect. The Bank attempts to minimize loan losses through various means. In particular, on larger credits, the Bank generally relies on the cash flow of a debtor as the source of repayment and secondarily on the value of the underlying collateral. In addition, the Bank attempts to utilize shorter loan terms in order to reduce the risk of a decline in the value of such collateral. The commercial loan portfolio was $24.4 million or 4.9% of total loans at December 31, 2017.
 
CONSUMER AND STUDENT LOANS
 The Bank’s consumer loans include loans to individuals such as auto loans, credit card loans and overdraft loans. The consumer loan portfolio was $5.1 million or 1.0% of total loans at December 31, 2017.
 
The Bank has U.S. Government guaranteed student loans, which were purchased through and serviced by a third-party and have a variable rate of interest. The U.S. Government guaranteed student loan portfolio was $10.7 million or 2.1% of total loans at December 31, 2017.
 
DEPOSIT ACTIVITIES
 Deposits are the major source of the Bank’s funds for lending and other investment activities. The Bank considers its regular savings, demand, NOW, premium NOW, money market, and non-brokered time deposits under $100,000 to be core deposits. These accounts comprised approximately 93.0% of the Bank’s total deposits at December 31, 2017. Generally, the Bank attempts to maintain the rates paid on its deposits at a competitive level. Time deposits of $100,000 through $250,000, and time deposits greater than $250,000 made up approximately 4.1% and 2.8%, respectively, of the Bank’s total deposits at December 31, 2017. During 2017, time deposits of $100,000 and over generally paid interest at rates the same or higher than certificates of less than $100,000. The majority of the Bank’s deposits are generated from Fauquier and Prince William Counties, Virginia.  Included in interest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2017 were $17.3 million of brokered deposits, or 3.0% of total deposits. Of the brokered deposits, $12.9 million or 2.3% of total deposits represent a reciprocal arrangement for existing Bank customers who desire FDIC insurance for deposits above current limits.

INVESTMENTS
 The Bank invests a portion of its assets in U.S. Government-sponsored corporation and agency obligations, state, county and municipal obligations, corporate obligations, mutual funds, FHLB stock and equity securities. The Bank’s investments are managed in relation to loan demand and deposit growth, and are generally used to provide for the investment of excess funds at reduced yields and risks relative to yields and risks of the loan portfolio, while providing liquidity to fund increases in loan demand or to offset fluctuations in deposits. The Bank’s total unrestricted and restricted investments, at fair value, were $72.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively, or 11.2% and 0.2% of total assets, respectively, at December 31, 2017.
GOVERNMENT SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 GENERAL. Bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. The following summary briefly addresses certain provisions of federal and state laws that apply to the Company or the Bank. This summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions.
 
EFFECT OF GOVERNMENTAL MONETARY POLICIES. The earnings and business of the Company and the Bank are affected by the economic and monetary policies of various regulatory authorities of the United States, especially the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve, among other things, regulates the supply of credit and money and setting interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions within the United States. The instruments of monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve for those purposes influence in various ways the overall level of investments, loans, other extensions of credits, and deposits, and the interest rates paid on liabilities and received on assets. Federal Reserve monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.
 
SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002. The Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), including the filing of annual, quarterly, and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). As an Exchange Act reporting company, the Company is directly affected by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “SOX”), which is aimed at improving corporate governance, internal controls and reporting procedures. The Company is complying with applicable SEC and other rules and regulations implemented pursuant to the SOX.
 
BANK HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION. The Company is a one-bank holding company, registered with the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHC Act”). As such, the Company is subject to the supervision, examination, and reporting requirements of the BHC Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. The Company is required to furnish to the Federal Reserve an annual report of its operations at the end of each fiscal year and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the BHC Act. The BHC Act generally prohibits the Company from engaging in activities other than banking or managing or controlling banks or other permissible subsidiaries and from acquiring or retaining direct or indirect control of any company engaged in any activities other than those activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be sufficiently related to banking or managing or controlling banks. With some limited exceptions, the BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before: acquiring substantially all the assets of any bank; acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if after such acquisition it would own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares); or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.  In addition, and subject to some exceptions, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring “control” of a bank holding company.
 
BANK REGULATION. The Bank is chartered under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The FDIC insures the deposits of the Bank's customers to the maximum extent provided by law. The Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve and the SCC and to other laws and regulations applicable to banks. These regulations include limitations on loans to a single borrower and to the Bank’s directors, officers and employees; requirements on the opening and closing of branch offices; requirements regarding the maintenance of prescribed regulatory capital and liquidity ratios; requirements to grant credit under equal and fair conditions; and requirements to disclose the costs and terms of such credit.  The SCC also has broad enforcement powers over the Bank, including the power to impose fines and other civil or criminal penalties and to appoint a receiver in order to conserve the Bank’s assets for the benefit of depositors and other creditors.
 
The Bank is also subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”). Under the terms of the CRA, the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency is required, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the community served by that bank, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency’s assessment of a bank’s record is made available to the public. Such assessment is required of any bank that has applied to (i) charter a national bank, (ii) obtain deposit insurance coverage for a newly chartered institution, (iii) establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, (iv) relocate an office, or (v) merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution. In the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or other bank holding company, the Federal Reserve will assess the record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company, and such records may be the basis for denying the application. The Bank received a rating of “satisfactory” at its last CRA performance evaluation as of February 9, 2015.
 
DIVIDENDS. Dividends from the Bank constitute the primary source of funds for dividends to be paid by the Company. There are various statutory and contractual limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, extend credit, or otherwise supply funds to the Company, including the requirement under Virginia banking laws that cash dividends only be paid out of net undivided profits and only if such dividends would not impair the capital of the Bank. The Federal Reserve also has the general authority to limit the dividends paid by bank holding companies and state member banks, if the payment of dividends is deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. The Federal Reserve has indicated that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only if (i) the organization’s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fund fully the dividends and (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Bank does not expect any of these laws, regulations or policies to materially impact its ability to pay dividends to the Company.
 
DEPOSIT INSURANCE. The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. On April 1, 2011, the deposit insurance assessment base changed from total deposits to average total assets minus average tangible equity, pursuant to a rule issued by the FDIC as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”).

Table of Contents
Also, on April 1, 2011, the FDIC began utilizing a risk-based assessment system that imposed insurance premiums based upon a risk category matrix that took into account a bank's capital level and supervisory rating. Effective, July 1, 2016, the FDIC again changed its deposit insurance pricing and eliminated all risk categories and now uses the “financial ratios method” based on CAMELS composite ratings to determine assessment rates for small established institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. The CAMELS rating system is a supervisory rating system designed to take into account and reflect all financial and operational risks that a bank may face, including capital adequacy, asset quality, management capability, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk (“CAMELS”). CAMELS composite ratings set a maximum assessment for CAMELS 1 and 2 rated banks, and set minimum assessments for lower rated institutions.
 
The FDIC's “reserve ratio” of the DIF to total industry deposits reached its 1.15% target effective June 30, 2016. On March 15, 2016, the FDIC implemented by final rule certain Dodd-Frank Act provisions by raising the DIF's minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. The FDIC imposed a 4.5 basis point annual surcharge on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. The new rule grants credits to smaller banks for the portion of their regular assessments that contribute to increasing the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. Prior to when the new assessment system became effective, the Bank's overall rate for assessment calculations was 9 basis points or less, which was within the range of assessment rates for the lowest risk category under the former FDIC assessment rules. In 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded expense of $312,000 and $489,000, respectively, for FDIC insurance premiums.
 
In addition, all FDIC insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC at an annual rate of approximately one basis point of insured deposits to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Savings Association Insurance Fund. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2019.
 
CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. The Company meets the eligibility criteria of a small bank holding company in accordance with the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement issued in February 2015, and is no longer obligated to report consolidated regulatory capital. The Bank continues to be subject to various capital requirements administered by banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank’s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
 
In July 2013, the Federal Reserve issued final rules that make technical changes to its capital rules to align them with the Basel III regulatory capital framework and meet certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules maintain the general structure of the prompt corrective action framework in effect at such time while incorporating certain increased minimum requirements. The final rules modified or left unchanged the components of regulatory capital, which are: (i) “total capital”, defined as core capital and supplementary capital less certain specified deductions from total capital such as reciprocal holdings of depository institution capital instruments and equity investments; (ii) “Tier 1 capital,” which consists principally of common and certain qualifying preferred shareholders’ equity (including grandfathered trust preferred securities) as well as retained earnings, less certain intangibles and other adjustments; and (iii) “Tier 2 capital”, which consists of cumulative preferred stock, long-term perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of subordinated and other qualifying debt (including certain hybrid capital instruments), and a limited amount of the general loan loss allowance. The Federal Reserve also has established a minimum leverage capital ratio of Tier 1 capital to average adjusted assets (“Tier 1 leverage ratio”).
 
Effective January 1, 2015, the final rules require the Bank to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets (increased from the prior requirement of 4.0%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets (unchanged from the prior requirement); and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4.0% of total assets (unchanged from the prior requirement). These are the initial capital requirements, which are being phased-in over a four-year period. When fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, the rules will require the  Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (which is added to the 4.5% common equity Tier 1 ratio as that buffer is phased-in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0% upon full implementation), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased-in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased-in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation), and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets.
 
The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirement began on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing by the same amount each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.
 
As of December 31, 2017, Tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted assets ratios of the Bank were 11.4% and 12.4%, respectively, thus exceeding the minimum requirements. The common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and leverage ratio of the Bank were 11.4% and 9.2%, respectively, as of December 31, 2017, well above the minimum requirements. Based on management’s understanding and interpretation of the new capital rules, it believes that, as of December 31, 2017, the Company and the Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under such rules on a fully phased-in basis as if such requirements were in effect as of such date.
 
PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION. Federal banking regulators are authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take certain actions against banks that fail to meet their capital requirements. The federal bank regulatory agencies have additional enforcement authority with respect to undercapitalized depository institutions. “Well capitalized” institutions may generally operate without supervisory restriction. With respect to “adequately capitalized” institutions, such banks cannot normally pay dividends or make any capital contributions that would leave it undercapitalized, they cannot pay a management fee to a controlling person if, after paying the fee, it would be undercapitalized, and they cannot accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the bank has applied for and been granted a waiver by the FDIC.

Immediately upon becoming “undercapitalized,” a depository institution is subject to the provisions of Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”), which: (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) require that the appropriate federal banking agency monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restrict the growth of the institution’s assets; and (v) require prior approval of certain expansion proposals. The appropriate federal banking agency for an undercapitalized institution also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions if the agency determines that any of these actions is necessary to resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long-term cost to the DIF, subject in certain cases to specified procedures. These discretionary supervisory actions include: (i) requiring the institution to raise additional capital; (ii) restricting transactions with affiliates; (iii) requiring divestiture of the institution or the sale of the institution to a willing purchaser; and (iv) any other supervisory action that the agency deems appropriate. These and additional mandatory and permissive supervisory actions may be taken with respect to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions.
 
The new capital requirement rules issued by the Federal Reserve incorporated new requirements into the prompt corrective action framework, pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA, by (i) introducing a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required ratio being 6.5% for well capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum ratio for well-capitalized status being 8.0% (as compared to the prior ratio of 6.0%); and (iii) eliminating the current provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio and still be well-capitalized. These new thresholds were effective for the Bank as of January 1, 2015. The minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (10.0%) and minimum leverage ratio (5.0%) for well-capitalized status were unchanged by the final rules. The Bank meets the definition of being “well capitalized” as of December 31, 2017.
 
The new capital requirements also include changes in the risk weights of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposures. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and nonresidential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise on nonaccrual status, a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable, a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital, and increased risk-weights (from 0% to up to 600%) for equity exposures.
 
SOURCE OF STRENGTH. Federal Reserve policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.
 
FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF ATLANTA. The Bank is a member of the FHLB, which provides funding to their members for making housing loans as well as loans for affordable housing and community development lending. FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. It makes loans to its members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB. As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB in an amount equal to at least 5% of the aggregate outstanding advances made by the FHLB to the Bank. In addition, the Bank is required to pledge collateral for outstanding advances. The borrowing agreement with the FHLB provides for the pledge by the Bank of various forms of securities and mortgage loans as collateral.
 
USA PATRIOT ACT. The USA PATRIOT Act became effective on October 26, 2001 and provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering. Among other provisions, the USA PATRIOT Act permits financial institutions, upon providing notice to the United States Treasury, to share information with one another in order to better identify and report to the federal government concerning activities that may involve money laundering or terrorists’ activities. The USA PATRIOT Act is considered a significant banking law in terms of information disclosure regarding certain customer transactions. Certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act impose the obligation to establish anti-money laundering programs, including the development of a customer identification program, and the screening of all customers against any government lists of known or suspected terrorists. Although it does create a reporting obligation and a cost of compliance, the USA PATRIOT Act has not materially affected the Bank’s products, services, or other business activities.
 
OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) is responsible for administering and enforcing economic and trade sanctions against specified foreign parties, including countries and regimes, foreign individuals and other foreign organizations and entities. OFAC publishes lists of prohibited parties that are regularly consulted by the Company in the conduct of its business in order to assure compliance. The Company is responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, prohibited parties identified by OFAC, avoiding unlicensed trade and financial transactions with such parties and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with OFAC requirements could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences for the Company.
 
MORTGAGE BANKING REGULATION. The Bank’s mortgage banking activities are subject to the rules and regulations of, and examination by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Housing Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs and state regulatory authorities with respect to originating, processing and selling mortgage loans. Those rules and regulations, among other things, establish standards for loan origination, prohibit discrimination, provide for inspections and appraisals of property, require credit reports on prospective borrowers and, in some cases, restrict certain loan features, and fix maximum interest rates and fees. In addition to other federal laws, mortgage origination activities are subject to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth-in-Lending Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Home Ownership Equity Protection Act, S.A.F.E. Act, and the regulations promulgated under these acts. These laws prohibit discrimination, require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit and settlement costs, limit payment for settlement services to the reasonable value of the services rendered and require the maintenance and disclosure of information regarding the disposition of mortgage applications based on race, gender, geographical distribution and income level.

CONSUMER LAWS AND REGULATIONS. The Bank is subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth herein is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth-in-Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Housing Act, and regulations issued under such acts, among others. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such customers.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), and giving it responsibility for implementing, examining, and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB focuses on (i) risks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws, (ii) the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets, (iii) depository institutions that offer a wide variety of consumer financial products and services, and (iv) non-depository companies that offer one or more consumer financial products or services.
 
The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer’s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer’s (i) lack of financial savvy, (ii) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (iii) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer’s interests. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction. Further, regulatory positions taken by the CFPB may influence how other regulatory agencies apply the subject consumer financial protection laws and regulations.
 
LOANS TO INSIDERS. The Federal Reserve Act and related regulations impose specific restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders of banks. Under Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, loans to a director, an executive officer and to a principal shareholder of a bank, and some affiliated entities of any of the foregoing, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated entities, the bank’s loan-to-one borrower limit. Loans in the aggregate to insiders and their related interests as a class may not exceed the Bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Section 22(h) also prohibits loans, above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency, to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders of a bank or bank holding company, and their respective affiliates, unless such loan is approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank with any “interested” director not participating in the voting. The FDIC has prescribed the loan amount, which includes all other outstanding loans to such person, as to which such prior board of director approval is required, as being the greater of $25,000 or 5% of capital and surplus (up to $500,000). Section 22(h) requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders be made on terms and underwriting standards substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons.
 
ABILITY-TO-REPAY AND QUALIFIED MORTGAGE RULE. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued a final rule effective January 10, 2014, amending Regulation Z as implemented by the Truth-in-Lending Act, requiring mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Mortgage lenders are required to determine consumers’ ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision: (i) current or reasonably expected income or assets; (ii) current employment status; (iii) the monthly payment on the covered transaction; (iv) the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan; (v) the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations; (vi) current debt obligations, alimony, and child support; (vii) the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and (viii) credit history. Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate “qualified mortgages,” which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a “qualified mortgage” is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount. Qualified mortgages that are “higher-priced” (e.g. subprime loans) garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rules, while qualified mortgages that are not “higher-priced” (e.g. prime loans) are given a safe harbor of compliance. The Company is predominantly an originator of compliant qualified mortgages.
 
CYBERSECURITY.  In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If the Company fails to observe the regulatory guidance, it could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. To date, the Company has not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, but its systems and those of its customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that the Company could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by the Company and its customers.
 
INCENTIVE COMPENSATION. In June 2010, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of financial institutions do not undermine the safety and soundness of such institutions by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of a financial institutions, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a financial institution’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the institution’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the financial institution’s board of directors.

The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of financial institutions, such as the Bank, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each financial institution based on the scope and complexity of the institution’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the institution’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the institution’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a financial institution if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the institution’s safety and soundness and the financial institution is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. As of December 31, 2017, the Company is not aware of any instances of non-compliance with the guidance.
 
TAX REFORM. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”).  The legislation made key changes to the U.S. tax law, including the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Act, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017 and recognized a provisional $1.7 million tax expense in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.  The Company is still analyzing certain aspects of the new law and refining its calculations, which could affect the measurement of these assets and liabilities or give rise to new deferred tax amounts.  The accounting is expected to be complete when the 2017 U.S. corporate income tax return is filed in 2018.
 
FUTURE REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY. Congress may enact legislation from time to time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, cannot be predicted, although enactment of the proposed legislation could impact the regulatory structure under which the Company and the Bank operate and may significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, require an increase in regulatory capital, require modifications to business strategy, and limit the ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or the Bank could have a material, adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Bank.
 
COMPETITION
 The Company encounters strong competition both in making loans and in attracting deposits. In one or more aspects of its business, the Bank competes with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking companies, and other financial intermediaries. Most of these competitors, some of which are affiliated with bank holding companies, have substantially greater resources and lending limits, and may offer certain services that the Bank does not currently provide. In addition, many of the Bank’s non-bank competitors are not subject to the same level of federal regulation that governs bank holding companies and federally insured banks. Recent federal and state legislation has heightened the competitive environment in which financial institutions must conduct their business, and the potential for competition among financial institutions of all types has increased significantly. To compete, the Bank relies upon specialized services, responsive handling of customer needs, and personal contacts by its officers, directors, and staff. Large multi-branch banking institutions tend to compete based primarily on price and the number and location of branches while smaller, independent financial institutions tend to compete primarily on price and personal service.
EMPLOYEES
 As of December 31, 2017, the Company and the Bank employed 150 full-time equivalent employees.  No employee is represented by a collective bargaining unit. The Company and the Bank consider relations with employees to be good.
