In this Report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars (“US$” or “$”) and any references to “Cdn$” and “Canadian dollars” are to the lawful currency of Canada. All references to “Till Shares” refer to Till’s restricted voting shares, par value $0.001.
 
Our Corporate History
 
Till Capital Ltd. was incorporated under the laws of Bermuda on August 20, 2012 under the name Resource Holdings Ltd. On March 19, 2014, we changed our name to Till Capital Ltd. in accordance with our bye-laws and Section 10 of the Bermuda Companies Act 1981, as amended (the “Companies Act”). Till Capital Ltd. is an exempted holding company with its principal place of business and registered office at Crawford House, 50 Cedar Avenue, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda, U.S. telephone number (208) 635-5415. Our registered agent is Compass Administration Services, Ltd.
 
On April 17, 2014, we acquired Americas Bullion Royalty Corp. (“AMB”) in a reverse takeover by way of a plan of arrangement (the “Arrangement”) under the British Columbia Business Corporations Act. Prior to the Arrangement, AMB was an exploration and development junior natural resource and mining company with royalty and exploration property holdings, and Till was an exempted holding company with no operations. Following completion of the Arrangement, we began to transition our business to primarily conduct reinsurance business through Resource Re Ltd. (“RRL”), our wholly-owned Bermuda-based subsidiary (a Class 3A insurance company in Bermuda). In support of that transition, through the Arrangement, we acquired an investment portfolio of cash, marketable securities, and illiquid securities from Kudu Partners L.P. (“Kudu”).
 
On May 15, 2015, Till acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Omega Insurance Holdings Inc. (“Holdings”), a privately held company based in Toronto, Canada, including its subsidiaries, Omega General Insurance Company (a fully licensed insurance company) (“Omega”) and Focus Group Inc. (“Focus”).
 
In the third quarter of 2017, Till initiated a plan to sell Holdings, including its subsidiaries, Omega and Focus. As a result of that decision, pursuant to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("U.S. GAAP"), Holdings is required to be classified as held for sale and is also required to be considered a discontinued operation. However, during the potential sale process, Holdings, Omega, and Focus each continues to operate as a normal operation of Till.

Our Business
 
Following completion of the Arrangement, we transitioned our business to primarily conduct reinsurance business through RRL, a wholly-owned subsidiary. In 2015, Till began the transition out of various investments in the natural resource sector. We also expanded into the insurance business through the acquisition of Holdings.
 
In the third quarter 2017, Till initiated a plan to sell Holdings. Till's management and Board of Directors believe the sale of Holdings will better position Till's operations for the benefit of its shareholders through other investments that include the possible financing of reinsurance contracts at RRL and other investments. Till has engaged an investment adviser to facilitate the sale of Holdings. There can be no assurance that the process will result in any transaction.
 
Overview of Insurance and Reinsurance Business
 
Insurance
 
Insurance is a business arrangement in which an insurance company agrees to indemnify another company or individual against the expenses associated with events that are unpredictable in advance with respect to their realization and/or their time of occurrence. The insurer charges a “premium” to the insured to cover its expected costs of the indemnity, including all expenses associated with the processing of covered claims, plus a margin for the insurer’s overhead costs, general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses, and profit. The premiums are determined by multiple factors, including actuarial estimates of the expected claims, the insurer’s overhead costs and G&A expenses, market conditions, and an assumed profit margin. Since there is generally some passage of time between when premiums are received and claim expenses are incurred, the premiums are typically invested in risk-appropriate securities to provide an investment return on insurance-related capital. The insurer profits when the composite premiums charged, combined with the insurer’s investment gains, exceed the insurer’s composite expenses. In the case that the latter composite expenses are larger than the composite premiums and investment income and gains, the insurer sustains a loss.
 
There are many different risk categories of insurance, having variable degrees of risk. In general, the spectrum of risks ranges from those having to do with events of higher frequency but lower severity, where claim expenses tend to be rather predictable, as compared to those having to do with infrequent and less predictable events that may have extreme claim costs when losses occur. The latter class of insurance is often denoted as “catastrophic” coverage. In general, the more predictable the claim costs and expenses are, the more stable the expected required reserve and related allocation of capital.

The insurance industry is highly-regulated, with specific licensing required for each class of insurance written. Insurance regulators monitor the fiscal performance of insurance companies under their charge and, in the U.S., Canada, and Bermuda, require those insurers to maintain certain levels of statutory capital and surplus. In addition, various regulators require company-specific calculated risk-based capital levels. Insurance regulators also establish limitations on the types of investments allowed in an insurer’s investment portfolio to minimize exposure to potential market losses. In combination with competitive pressures, those regulations and requirements result in the insurance industry being driven by the type of insurance being written, with the volatility in the expected returns generally being the lowest for higher-frequency, lower-severity classes of insurance, and the highest for catastrophic coverage.
 
Reinsurance
 
Reinsurance is an arrangement whereby one insurance company, the “reinsurer,” agrees to indemnify another insurance company, the “cedent,” for all or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the cedent. Reinsurance can benefit a cedent in a number of ways, including reducing exposure on individual or multiple risks, providing catastrophe protections from large or multiple losses, and providing surplus relief to assist the cedent in maintaining or managing its capital and surplus risk exposure. Reinsurance can also be used to help provide a cedent additional underwriting capacity by assuming all or a portion of the cedent’s contract risk through fronting and quota-share reinsurance arrangements that may permit the cedent to accept larger risks and/or to underwrite a greater number of risks without a corresponding increase in its capital.
 
Reinsurance is generally written on a treaty or facultative basis. Treaty reinsurance is an agreement whereby the reinsurer assumes a specified portion or category of risk under all qualifying policies issued by the cedent during the term of the agreement, usually one year. When a reinsurer writes reinsurance on a treaty basis, the reinsurer does not re-underwrite each individual risk and generally accepts the original underwriting decisions made by the cedent. Treaty reinsurance is typically written on either a proportional or excess of loss basis. A proportional reinsurance treaty is an arrangement whereby a reinsurer assumes a predetermined proportional share of the premiums and losses attributable to a specific book of business. An excess of loss treaty is an arrangement whereby a reinsurer assumes losses that exceed a specific retention of loss by the cedent. Facultative reinsurance, on the other hand, is underwritten on a risk-by-risk basis that allows the reinsurer to determine the pricing for each exposure.
 
A period of time, sometimes significant, normally elapses between the receipt of reinsurance premiums and the payment of reinsurance claims. While premiums are generally payable to the reinsurer at inception of the underlying coverage, claim payments typically occur later. The related claim process, generally, begins with the occurrence of an event causing an insured loss followed by (i) the reporting of the loss by the insured to its broker or agent; (ii) the reporting by the broker or agent to the insurer; (iii) the reporting by the insurer/cedent to its reinsurance intermediary or agent; (iv) the reporting by the reinsurance intermediary or agent to the reinsurer; (v) the cedent’s adjustment and payment of the loss; and (vi) the payment to the cedent by the reinsurer. During that elapsed time period, reinsurers generally are able to invest premiums pursuant to their investment management strategy to earn investment income along with net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses on investments.
 
Summary of Our Reinsurance and Insurance Business
 
RRL
 
RRL’s business strategy is to offer reinsurance coverage to a select group of insurance companies, e.g., captive insurers, privately-held insurers, and other global insurers and reinsurers. In addition to more traditional investments, RRL has an investment approach, ancillary to the reinsurance business, that includes alternative asset strategies.
 
Till may conduct certain reinsurance business through its wholly-owned subsidiary, RRL. RRL was incorporated in Bermuda in August 2012 and licensed as a Class 3A insurance company by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (“BMA”) in August 2013. Certain of the conditions of that license are summarized as follows:
 

• | RRL is to, at all times, meet and maintain the relevant solvency margin(s), liquidity, and other ratios applicable under Bermuda law;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Without obtaining the prior written approval of the BMA, RRL is not to:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Write any “long- term” business, as such expression is understood in Bermuda’s Insurance Act of 1978, as amended and its related regulations (the “Insurance Act”);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enter into any contracts of retrocession other than with Multi-Strat Re Ltd., a Class 3A Bermuda insurance company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6
-


• | Declare and/or pay any dividends and/or make any capital contributions to RRL’s parent, shareholders, or affiliates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
RRL entered into its initial reinsurance contracts effective December 31, 2014 through Multi-Strat Re Ltd. (“Multi-Strat Re”). Those initial reinsurance contracts were novated in September 2015 and RRL currently has no reinsurance contracts in force. In the future, RRL may participate in reinsurance contracts using the Multi-Strat Re platform to underwrite medium- to long-term property and casualty business, as acceptable opportunities are identified.
 
RRL Reinsurance Business
 
RRL’s may offer property and casualty insurers the opportunity to cede a proportionate amount of their insurance risk with the objectives of achieving an underwriting profit and retaining most of the investment returns on the related premium- and reserve-related liability investment float. RRL may also underwrite loss portfolio transfers of prior business written by an insurer to provide adverse development protection. However, the downside risks on loss portfolio transfers are to be contractually capped relative to the premium collected.
Reinsurance Strategy
 
RRL has been a party to a quota-share retrocession agreement (the “Retrocession Agreement”) and a master services agreement (the “MSA”), collectively, the “Multi-Strat Agreements”, with Multi-Strat Re in respect of the reinsurance arrangements. Under the terms of the Multi-Strat Agreements, Multi-Strat Re is expected to assume risks from insurers, reinsurers, and captive insurers. Multi-Strat Re will, in turn, retrocede all of its premiums and risks to its pool of subscribing reinsurers, including RRL and reinsurers similar to RRL, based on the individual subscribing company’s acceptance of its subject risks and relative level of equity capital and appetite for reinsurance risks.
 
As part of its participation in the Multi-Strat Re program, RRL incurs two types of expenses in connection with its reinsurance underwriting, namely, (i) initial payments for sourcing premiums, including, but not limited to, brokerage, commissions, expert opinions, taxes, and pre-underwriting audits, and (ii) ongoing payments for claims handling and risk monitoring of business underwritten, including, but not limited to, audits, technical accounting and reporting, collateral administration, and underwriting renewals. Multi-Strat Re charges each reinsurer a retrocession commission on any premium at the time of binding and an annual administration fee for servicing the business underwritten. Multi-Strat Re also charges a performance fee based on the difference between the targeted underwriting profitability and the actual underwriting profitability, payable when the reinsurer is no longer at risk.
 
Annually, RRL may opt to maintain or increase the portion of its capital committed to the Multi-Strat Re program or withdraw from the program. If RRL elects to withdraw from the program, Multi-Strat Re is to consider, but is not obligated to, reallocate RRL’s portion of the reinsured book to the other Class 3A reinsurers, including other Multi-Strat Re participating reinsurers, provided that those other Class 3A reinsurers have the capacity and willingness to accept any such reallocation.
 
Under the MSA, Multi-Strat Re remains obligated to service the business underwritten and RRL remains obligated to pay the administrative servicing fee to Multi-Strat Re. Once RRL has hired senior staff, RRL may elect to continue to do business with Multi-Strat Re in conjunction with initiating its own insurance or reinsurance underwriting or RRL may ultimately withdraw from new business under the Multi-Strat Re program consistent with the Retrocession Agreement.
 
Underwriting
 
For all insurance business that is accepted by RRL from Multi-Strat Re, RRL relies on Multi-Strat Re to fulfill the role of underwriter for that business by adhering, at a minimum, to the underwriting guidelines set forth in the MSA.
 
The types of non-acceptable risks and exposures that RRL will not underwrite include, but are not limited to, (i) war and civil risks, (ii) nuclear risks, (iii) windstorms, earthquake, flood, and terrorism risks, (iv) cybersecurity exposures, (v) asbestos and environmental risks, and (vi) master policies issued to a risk group, association, or an organization that solicits its members under a mass marketing program. However, excluded risk exposures of an incidental nature may be included in business to be underwritten. RRL does not intend to underwrite life or health insurance.
 
Premium Payments
 
Premiums on business assumed by RRL are paid directly to an account in the name of Multi-Strat Re, to its agents in a fiduciary capacity, or into collateral accounts. Multi-Strat Re may not use those premiums except for certain purposes as specified in the MSA.

7
-

Claims Handling
 
All claim billings are reviewed to ensure that the billings are covered by the terms and conditions of the reinsurance agreements (period of coverage, limits, etc.). As a reinsurer, RRL does not intend to handle claims directly, but will retain the right to audit the cedent’s handling of claims.
Security and Funding
 
Every insurance obligation placed through the Multi-Strat platform by RRL is required to be collateralized to the aggregate limit reinsured by RRL using either Reinsurance Trust Agreements (“RTAs”) or Letters of Credit (“LOCs”) from banks rated “A-” or better.
Regulatory Considerations - Solvency II
 
Bermuda has been awarded full equivalence for commercial insurers (which criteria includes Class 3A insurers) under Europe’s Solvency II regime applicable to insurance companies, which regime came into effect on January 1, 2016. As a Class 3A insurance company, RRL is required to comply with Solvency II.
 
Solvency II is a European-based regulatory frame-work for regulation of the insurance industry, the key objectives of which are to (i) improve consumer protection by ensuring a uniform and enhanced level of policyholder protection across the European Union, (ii) modernize the insurance regulatory focus from compliance monitoring and capital to evaluating insurers’ risk profiles and the quality of their risk management and governance systems, (iii) increase harmonization of the various country regulatory regimes, and (iv) establish a regulatory framework that includes not just capital concerns, but a more comprehensive program of regulatory requirements for insurers, including licensing/authorizations, corporate governance, supervisory reporting, public disclosure, risk assessment and management, as well as the establishment of solvency and reserving criteria.  In summary, the Solvency II focus is comprised of three “pillars” that include financial requirements, governance and supervision, and reporting and disclosure.
 
Ratings
 
RRL may in the future apply for a rating from an insurance industry rating company, e.g., A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), a company that provides credit ratings services for the insurance industry. If such a rating is obtained, RRL will strive to maintain capital levels consistent with an “A-” or better rating. There is no guarantee that such a rating will be obtained by RRL. Debt may be used as deemed prudent, consistent with maintaining such rating, though, in general, RRL expects to utilize a less leveraged asset mix than that used by many of its peers.
Holdings
 
Holdings Background
 
On May 15, 2015, Till completed the acquisition of Holdings, a privately-held insurance holding company domiciled in Toronto, Canada and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Omega and Focus. In the second quarter of 2015, Till reported the purchase price of $14,062,970, an amount that represented 1.2 times Holdings’ book value as of the closing date, and included $751,880 for pending insurance transactions in process at the time. All payments were subject to a 5% hold-back to be paid to Holdings' shareholders based on Omega’s 2015 operating results, and adjusted to give effect to any adverse development above 10% in loss reserves as calculated from the closing date until December 31, 2015. One of the two pending insurance transactions was closed in the third quarter of 2015 and the other one was closed in October 2015. The final amount for the two pending insurance transactions was $730,994. Accordingly, the final purchase price for Holdings was approximately $14,042,000.
 
Holdings was incorporated in January 2004 under the Ontario Business Corporations Act. In September 2004, Holdings began operations by incorporating a wholly-owned subsidiary insurance company, Omega, under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada). In September 2004, Holdings acquired all of the assets and liabilities of Focus, an Ontario corporation, through the purchase of all of its outstanding shares. Focus was formed in 1985 and has been providing management and consulting services to the insurance industry for over 30 years. Focus also has significant experience and expertise in managing the operations of foreign insurance companies that want to operate in Canada without establishing a fully-staffed Canadian operation. Omega and Focus have two main target markets:
 

• | Managing “run-off” business of insurance companies that have decided to exit the Canadian market, in whole or in part. Omega and Focus provide operational services to facilitate the exit of those companies and the management of the financial and legal obligations of that business on a continuing basis, while being able to repatriate their surplus capital in a more-timely manner.

• | Providing those insurers that want to access the Canadian market an ability to do so in an efficient manner, through customized fronting arrangements and other means.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In October 2004, Omega received its order to commence insurance business from the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (“OSFI”), an independent agency of the Government of Canada. Omega is authorized to write all classes of insurance, other than life insurance, subject to the limitation that, in the case of policies that fall within classes other than property and liability, insurance approval has to be obtained from OSFI. At December 31, 2017, Omega was licensed in all provinces and territories in Canada. Omega’s insurance business focuses on property and casualty insurance. Omega earns income from underwriting insurance and reinsurance risks and fees from managing insurers in run-off.
 
Focus provides management services to Omega. Focus also has chief agency contracts with three foreign insurers and management contracts with two foreign insurers. Focus also provides ongoing and one-time consulting services in the areas of taxation, risk management, mergers and acquisitions, expert witness testimony, and claim reviews.
 
As a participant in the Canadian insurance industry, Omega is subject to significant regulations enacted by the Canadian federal and provincial governments, including capital and solvency standards, restrictions on certain types of investments, and periodic market conduct and financial examinations by regulators. Omega is a property and casualty insurance company that is regulated by OSFI. Omega has established procedures and controls to gain reasonable assurance that it is in compliance with all relevant laws, rules, and regulations.
 
Omega
 
Omega’s revenue is from three sources, namely, (i) premiums on portfolio transfer transactions and fees related to managing Canadian branch offices in “run off,” (ii) assumption reinsurance, including servicing fees in certain transactions, and (iii) premiums on direct insurance business. To manage its risk exposures, Omega purchases reinsurance for both its portfolio transfer and direct insurance businesses.
 
As a reinsurer, Omega provides assumption reinsurance to insurance companies that want to exit the Canadian market, and to insurance companies that want to transfer of all their remaining claim liabilities on particular books of business. Those arrangements are commonly referred to as “run-off” or “loss portfolio transfer” assumption business. Omega also provides support services on assumed risks.
 
Omega’s business also includes acting as the primary insurer, direct writer, for insurance companies seeking Canadian business, but lacking the appropriate Canadian insurance licenses. In that capacity, Omega acts as the direct writer, or fronting company, for a specific insurance company, and Omega typically will cede most or all of that direct, fronted, business to that insurer. Omega remains contingently liable for the payment of losses on such fronted business. Omega’s principal income on fronting business is a fee for the management of the business in Canada. If Omega retains any of that fronting business, Omega also retains a portion of the premium and retains the insurance risk on the portion retained by Omega. That business generally requires customized contractual arrangements to address the unique aspects of those markets and to define the specifics of the coverage. Omega tends to write Canadian insurance business that is non-traditional, also known as “boutique” insurance, where there are fewer competitors. Those classes of insurance typically require more extensive research regarding the insurance risks, as there may be less generally-available loss-related data on those non-traditional types of business.
 
Relationship between RRL and Omega
 
RRL and Omega are wholly-owned insurance subsidiary companies of Till, but operate independently of each other and maintain their distinct legal and governance structures.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
Till believes it is well positioned to take advantage and leverage potential opportunities in its businesses due to Till’s insurance and investment capabilities, and its ability to leverage the resources of its business partners. Those strengths include:
Industry Expertise
 
Till has internal resources that are strong in investment management and insurance operations, including, among others, product development, underwriting, claims management, reinsurance, and financial management. In addition, through the leveraging of our outside service providers, including actuarial, claims management, the Multi-Strat platform, and select investment advisors, Till is well positioned to actively monitor and manage our assets and liabilities as a whole, matching cash flows to produce a resilient business portfolio to optimize our long-term performance.

Development of Tailored Solutions for Clients
 
Our focus is on developing tailored solutions to best address our clients’ insurance and reinsurance needs. By delivering individualized solutions to cedents and insureds, we expect to attract new business and to structure arrangements that may be more advantageous to both our clients and us.
Investment Strategy
 
Till Management Company (“TMC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Till, oversees Till’s investment strategy and serves as an investment advisor to Till, RRL, Holdings, and Omega.
 
Till’s primary investments are its 100% ownership of RRL and Holdings, and ownership of mineral properties and mining royalties. Till may pursue acquisitions of other companies in the insurance industry or other sectors, but does not have any plans to do so at this time. Till’s investment strategy is designed to not only meet the regulatory requirements of RRL’s and Omega’s insurance business, but to also research investments that provide opportunity to leverage those investments with higher risks to benefit Till’s overall business and shareholder returns.
RRL’s Investment Guidelines
 
RRL’s investment policy is intended to achieve the highest portfolio yields consistent with its overall objectives, strategy, and parameters, including the maintenance of adequate liquidity to reasonably meet its obligations and liabilities. Those objectives take into account the “prudent person” objective of balancing a reasonably high and stable growth rate while avoiding undue risk of loss.
 
It is the responsibility of RRL’s investment advisor(s) to provide guidance and/or instructions for the purchase or sale of securities for RRL with accredited, reputable, and reliable brokers/traders/custodians in the investment community. All transactions are to be promptly and accurately recorded as they occur and appropriate reports are to be submitted to RRL by the advisors for review.
 
All investment transactions, along with the investment performance and adherence to RRL’s investment policy, are reviewed by the Board of Directors of RRL, or its designee, on a regular basis to ensure compliance with that investment policy and Bermudian laws and regulations.
 
At least annually, all RRL officers, advisors, and any others associated with the investment function confirm to the Board of Directors of RRL that they have no conflict of interest and undertake not to engage in any activity pursuant to the investment function that could produce a potential conflict of interest.
 
RRL reviews its investment portfolio together with its reinsurance operations on a periodic basis with its advisors to ensure that RRL has sufficient capital to withstand modeled losses on either or both of its investment and reinsurance portfolios.

RRL’s Investment in Silver Predator Corp.
 
Following the Arrangement, RRL owned approximately 55% of the issued and outstanding shares of Silver Predator Corp. (“SPD”) and had a $4.5 million collateralized note receivable from SPD (the “SPD Collateralized Note”). On July 31, 2014, SPD completed a non-brokered private placement of 19,000,000 common shares at Cdn$0.07 per share for proceeds of Cdn$1,330,000. In April 2015, SPD issued 29,028,000 of its common shares to RRL at a value of Cdn$0.05 per share as the first payment on the SPD Collateralized Note. At December 31, 2017, RRL owned approximately 64% of SPD’s issued and outstanding common shares.
 
SPD has historically been engaged in exploring for and developing economically viable silver, gold, and tungsten deposits in Canada and the United States, with a focus on Nevada and Idaho. SPD’s two core properties were the Springer tungsten mine and mill in Pershing County, Nevada (the “Springer Property”) and the Taylor mine and mill near Ely, Nevada (the “Taylor Property”). SPD also owns the Copper King property near Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, the Cornucopia property in Elko County, Nevada, and several additional properties in Nevada. SPD is not currently engaged in any mining or exploration activities; however, a drill program for its Copper King property is being considered for 2018.
 
In January 2017, SPD transferred 100% of its ownership of the Springer Property to RRL in exchange for the full release and satisfaction of the SPD Collateralized Note. The balance of that SPD Collateralized Note, at the date of transfer to RRL, amounted to $3.97 million. Following that transfer, RRL distributed 100% of its ownership of the Springer Property to its parent company Till Capital. The Springer Property is currently owned by Till's wholly-owned subsidiary Golden Predator US Holding Corp. ("GPUS").
 
Taylor Property
 
SPD owns a 100% interest in the Taylor Property, a gold and silver mining and mill project site located in White Pine County, Nevada, 17 miles south of Ely, Nevada. The property consists of 130 unpatented and patented lode claims and five unpatented mill site claims totaling approximately 2,166 acres, subject to a 2% net smelter royalty and a 1% net profits royalty. The Taylor Property was a high-grade underground silver producer during the late 1880s, and again in the 1960s. The most significant production history occurred from 1981 to 1984, when its then owner produced over five million ounces of silver from several open pits. The mine closed due to low silver prices, leaving significant current resources pre-stripped in close proximity to the existing mill. The mill opened again in 1989 to process ore from a nearby gold mine and continued in operation until 1991 when the nearby mine closed. To restart mining and production at the mine and mill, SPD will need to either modernize and expand the existing mill or build a new mill and design and build a new tailings facility. SPD will also need to conduct further exploration of the property to identify mineral reserves. SPD did not conduct any significant exploration on the Taylor Property in 2015, 2016, or 2017.
 
In April 2017, SPD entered into an option agreement (the “Taylor Agreement”) with Montego Resource Inc. (“Montego”) pursuant to which Montego has the right to acquire the Taylor Property from SPD.
 
Under the terms of the Taylor Agreement, Montego can acquire the Taylor Property in consideration for the completion of a series of cash payments totaling $1,200,000, issuing 2,500,000 common shares of Montego to SPD, and incurring expenditures of at least $700,000 on the Taylor Property. Upon completion of the payments, share issuances, and expenditures, Montego will hold a 100% interest in the Taylor Property, subject to a 2% net smelter returns royalty ("NSR") and a 1% net profit royalty that will be retained by SPD.
 
The payments, share issuances, and expenditures must be completed in accordance with the following schedule:
 

• | At Closing: $200,000 cash and 500,000 common shares
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | 6 months from Closing: $100,000 cash and 300,000 common shares
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | 12 months from Closing: $200,000 cash and 400,000 common shares and expenditures of $100,000
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 24 months from Closing: $300,000 cash and 500,000 common shares and expenditures of $250,000
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 36 months from Closing: $400,000 cash and 800,000 common shares and expenditures of $350,000
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The closing occurred on April 20, 2017 on which date SPD had received $200,000 cash and 500,000 common shares of Montego initially valued at $156,309. On October 19, 2017 SPD received $100,000 cash and 300,000 common shares of Montego initially valued at $45,655 for the second installment from Montego on the Taylor Agreement.
 
Omega’s Investment Guidelines
 
Omega’s investment policy is intended to achieve the highest portfolio yields consistent with its overall objectives, strategy, and operational parameters, including the maintenance of adequate liquidity to reasonably meet its obligations and liabilities and regulatory guidelines. Those objectives take into account the “prudent person” objective of balancing a reasonable and stable income stream while avoiding undue risk of loss.

Springer Property
 
Until January 2017, SPD owned a 100% interest in the Springer Property, a non-operating former tungsten production facility located on the east flank of the Eugene Mountains, approximately 25 miles southwest of Winnemucca, Nevada. In addition to the former tungsten production facility, the project consists of 209 lode mineral claims, 25 placer claims, and fee lands for a total area of approximately 6,400 acres, including all mineral claims and fee lands, subject to a 2% net smelter royalty. The Springer production facility consists of a 1,360-foot vertical shaft and underground workings, a 1,200 ton per day mill with automated rod/ball mill grinding and flotation circuits, plus all water rights, and most permits necessary for operation of the facility. SPD has not conducted any significant exploration on the Springer Property for several years. As described previously, in January 2017, SPD transferred 100% of its ownership of the Springer Property to RRL. Following that transfer, RRL distributed the Springer Property to Till. Till, in turn, contributed, as capital, the Springer Property to Till's wholly-owned subsidiary GPUS.
 
In the second quarter of 2015, SPD announced its intention to realize value from assets by initiating a process to sell all, or part, of the tangible and intangible assets at some of its properties in Nevada. At that time, SPD disclosed that mining and production at the facility could be restarted with additional capital expenditures required for exploration to determine the existence of mineral reserves, modernization, and refurbishment. In 2017, Till engaged an investment adviser to facilitate the sale of the Springer Property. There can be no assurance that the process will result in any transaction.
 
Neither GPUS, nor Till, currently intend to allocate additional capital to restart mining, exploration, and production at the Springer Property.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
Bermuda Insurance Regulations
 
Bermuda Exchange Control Regulation
 
The BMA must give permission for all issuances and transfers of securities of Bermuda exempted companies like Till and RRL, unless the proposed transaction is exempted by the BMA’s written general permissions. In its policy statement, dated June 1, 2005, the BMA provides that, where any equity securities, including Till Shares, of a Bermuda company are listed on an appointed stock exchange, general permission is given for the issuance and subsequent transfer of any securities of such a company from and/or to a non-resident, for as long as any such equity securities of such company remain so listed. Till Shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange-Venture (“TSX-V”) and on the NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”); both the TSX-V and NASDAQ are deemed to be appointed stock exchanges under Bermuda law. Therefore, following the listing the Till Shares on the TSX-V, in April 2014, the general permission issued by the BMA resulted in Till Shares being freely transferable among persons who are residents and non-residents of Bermuda.

Although Till is incorporated in Bermuda, Till is classified as a non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes by the BMA. Other than transferring Bermuda dollars out of Bermuda, there are no restrictions on our ability to transfer funds into and out of Bermuda or to pay dividends in currency other than Bermuda dollars to nonresidents of Bermuda who are holders of Till Shares.
 
The Insurance Act of 1978.
 
The Insurance Act and related regulations of Bermuda that regulate the insurance business of RRL provide that no person is to carry on any insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer under the Insurance Act by the BMA. Under the Insurance Act, insurance business includes reinsurance business. The BMA is required by the Insurance Act to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance business and, in particular, whether it has, or has available to it, adequate knowledge and expertise. The registration of an applicant as an insurer is subject to its compliance with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the BMA may impose from time to time.
 
The Insurance Act also imposes, on Bermuda insurance companies, various solvency and liquidity standards, auditing and reporting requirements, and grants to the BMA powers to supervise, investigate, and intervene in the affairs of those insurance companies. Certain significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance regulatory framework are set forth below.
 
RRL, like all Bermuda domiciled insurers, is required to maintain a principal office in Bermuda and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda. Further, any registered insurer that is a Class 3A insurer or above is required to maintain a head office in Bermuda and direct and manage its insurance business from Bermuda.
 
Every registered Bermuda insurer must appoint an independent auditor who will annually audit and report on the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return of the insurer, both of which, in the case of RRL, are required to be filed annually with the BMA. The independent auditor of RRL must be approved by the BMA and may be the same person or firm that audits RRL’s financial statements and reports for presentation to its shareholders. RRL’s independent auditor is Arthur Morris & Company Limited and has been approved by the BMA.
 
Generally, a Class 3A insurer must appoint an individual approved by the BMA to be its loss reserve specialist and annually submit an opinion of its approved loss reserve specialist with its statutory financial statements and return in respect of its loss and loss expense provisions. Ordinance Holdings Limited serves as the actuary for RRL and has been approved by the BMA.
 
A Bermuda insurer, such as RRL, has to prepare annual statutory financial statements and file a statutory financial return. The Insurance Act prescribes rules for the preparation and substance of such statutory financial statements (that include, in statutory form, a balance sheet, an income statement, a statement of capital and surplus, and notes related thereto). The insurer is required to give detailed information and analyses as regards premiums, claims, reinsurance, and investments. The statutory financial statements are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are distinct from the financial statements prepared for presentation to the insurer’s shareholders under the Companies Act, which financial statements are to be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. An insurer is required to submit the annual statutory financial statements as part of its annual statutory financial return. The statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return do not form part of the public records maintained by the BMA or the Bermuda Registrar of Companies.
 
Canada Insurance Regulation
 
Omega’s business is regulated through various federal and provincial regulators in Canada and in the provinces in which it operates. Omega’s insurance business is subject to regulation and supervision by OSFI under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada) and by insurance regulatory authorities of the provinces in which it is licensed to conduct business. That regulation and supervision is designed to protect policyholders and creditors rather than investors. Provincial insurance regulations pertain primarily to market conduct, and the authorities have latitude to effect change in the commercial operating environment.
 
OSFI has established, and monitors compliance with, required minimum capital levels and targeted capital levels for insurance companies such as Omega. OSFI also requires insurance companies, such as Omega, to establish, and adhere to, prudent investment and lending policies, standards, and procedures that are subject to certain limits. Further, there are various regulatory requirements, guidelines, and/or restrictions on dividends, capital, reinsurance, acquisitions, and divestitures that govern Omega’s business. In certain circumstances, prior regulatory approvals for certain transactions and products are required.

United States Insurance Regulation
 
Neither RRL nor Omega currently intend to do business in any jurisdiction in the United States. The insurance laws of each state of the United States and of many foreign countries regulate the sale of insurance and reinsurance within their jurisdictions by alien insurers and reinsurers, such as RRL and Omega that are organized under the laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions. RRL and Omega intend to conduct their respective business so as not to be subject to the licensing requirements of insurance regulators in the United States or elsewhere, other than their respective domicile countries, namely, Bermuda and Canada, respectively.
Competition
 
The insurance and reinsurance market is well established and very competitive with both mature and new companies participating in the marketplace. The market exhibits periodic cycles of soft and hard pricing that our insurance subsidiaries, RRL and Omega, consider in the underwriting of their insurance and reinsurance business.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2017, Till and its subsidiaries had a total of 18 full-time employees, ten employees are located in Canada and eight employees are located in the United States. There are also three part-time employees in Bermuda and one part-time employee in Canada.
