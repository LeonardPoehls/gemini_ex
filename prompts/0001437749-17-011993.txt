ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General
 
We are headquartered in Delanco Township, New Jersey and operate as a community-oriented financial institution dedicated to serving the financial services needs of consumers and businesses within our market areas. Delanco Federal is engaged primarily in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and using such funds to originate one- to four-family real estate loans and to a much lesser extent, multi-family and nonresidential real estate loans, home equity and consumer loans which we primarily hold for investment. Delanco Federal also maintains an investment portfolio. Delanco Federal’s primary federal regulator is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”). The FDIC, through the Deposit Insurance Fund, insures Delanco Federal’s deposit accounts up to the applicable legal limits. Delanco Federal is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of New York.
 
Effective October 16, 2013, Delanco Bancorp completed its public stock offering in connection with the conversion of Delanco MHC (the “MHC”) from the mutual holding company to the stock holding company form of organization (the “Conversion”). As a result of the Conversion, the Company succeeded old Delanco Bancorp, a federal corporation (“old Delanco Bancorp”), as the holding company for Delanco Federal and the MHC ceased to exist. A total of 525,423 shares of Company common stock were sold in a subscription and community offering at $8.00 per share, including shares purchased by the Delanco Federal Savings Bank’s employee stock ownership plan (the “ESOP”). Additionally, approximately 420,093 shares were issued to the stockholders of old Delanco Bancorp (other than the MHC) in exchange for their shares of old Delanco Bancorp common stock at an exchange ratio of 0.5711 share of Company common stock for each share of old Delanco Bancorp common stock.
 
Delanco Bancorp’s business activity is the ownership of the outstanding capital stock of Delanco Federal. Delanco Bancorp does not own or lease any property but instead uses the premises, equipment and other property of Delanco Federal with the payment of appropriate rental fees, as required by applicable law and regulations, under the terms of an expense allocation agreement. In the future, Delanco Bancorp may acquire or organize other operating subsidiaries; however, there are no current plans, arrangements, agreements or understandings, written or oral, to do so.

Market Area 
 
We are headquartered in Delanco Township, New Jersey. In addition to our main office, we operate a full-service branch office in Cinnaminson, New Jersey. Delanco and Cinnaminson are in western Burlington County, New Jersey, across the Delaware River from northeastern Philadelphia. We consider Burlington County to be our primary market area.
 
 



The population of Burlington County has remained steady in recent years, while unemployment has remained high, creating challenges for the growth of our business. The 2015 Census-estimated population of Burlington County was approximately 450,000. Burlington County’s population is projected to remain steady through 2018. The Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD metropolitan statistical area, of which Burlington County is a part, is the sixth largest in the United States as of July 2012 with an estimated population of 6.0 million. The city of Philadelphia is the fifth most populous city in the United States.
 
According to the National Association of REALTORS, the median sales price for existing single-family homes in the Philadelphia metropolitan area decreased from $234,900 in 2007 to $204,900 in March 2015. In comparison, the median sales price for existing single-family homes in the United States decreased from $217,900 in 2007 to $210,700 in March 2015.
 
Competition
 
We face significant competition for the attraction of deposits and origination of loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the many financial institutions operating in our market area and, to a lesser extent, from other financial service companies such as brokerage firms, credit unions and insurance companies. Several large banks operate in our market area, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo & Company, TD Bank and PNC Bank. These institutions are significantly larger than us and, therefore, have significantly greater resources. We also face competition for customers’ funds from money market funds, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities. At June 30, 2016, which is the most recent date for which data is available from the FDIC, we held 1.09% of the deposits in Burlington County, New Jersey.
 
Our competition for loans comes primarily from financial institutions in our market area and, to a lesser extent, from other financial service providers, such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from non-depository financial service companies, such as insurance companies, securities companies and specialty finance companies.
 
We expect competition to remain intense in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Federal law permits affiliation among banks, securities firms and insurance companies, which promotes a competitive environment in the financial services industry. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our growth in the future.
 
Lending Activities
 
One- to Four-Family Residential Loans. We offer three types of residential mortgage loans: fixed-rate loans, balloon loans and adjustable-rate loans. We offer fixed-rate mortgage loans with terms of 15, 20 or 30 years and balloon mortgage loans with terms of five, ten or 15 years. We offer adjustable-rate mortgage loans with interest rates and payments that adjust annually after an initial fixed period of one or three years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans generally are adjusted to a rate equal to a percentage above the one year U.S. Treasury index. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 2% per adjustment period and the lifetime interest rate cap is generally 6.0% over the initial interest rate of the loan. We generally retain all of the mortgage loans that we originate, although from time to time we have sold some of the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage loans that we originated. If we choose to sell any mortgages in the future, it would be with the servicing of the loans retained by Delanco Federal.
 
Borrower demand for adjustable-rate or balloon loans compared to fixed-rate loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates, and the difference between the interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans as compared to the interest rates and loan fees for adjustable-rate or balloon loans. The relative amount of fixed-rate, balloon and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment. We have seen little demand for adjustable-rate loans in the low interest rate environment that has prevailed in recent years. The loan fees, interest rates and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us on the basis of our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions.
 
While one- to four-family residential real estate loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full either upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans. We do not offer loans with negative amortization and generally do not offer interest only loans.

We will make loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 95%; however, we require private mortgage insurance for loans with a loan-to-value ratio over 80%. We require all properties securing mortgage loans to be appraised by a board-approved independent appraiser. We generally require title insurance on all first mortgage loans. Borrowers must obtain hazard insurance, and flood insurance is required for loans on properties located in a flood zone.
 
Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. We have traditionally offered fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans secured by a variety of commercial and multi-family real estate, such as small office buildings, warehouses, retail properties and small apartment buildings. We originate a variety of fixed- and adjustable-rate commercial real estate and multi-family real estate loans generally for terms up to five to seven years and payments based on an amortization schedule of up to 25 years. Adjustable-rate loans are typically based on the Prime Rate and the Constant Maturity Treasury rate. Loans are secured by first mortgages, and amounts generally do not exceed 80% of the property’s appraised value.
 
Construction Loans. We originate loans to individuals to finance the construction of residential dwellings. We also make construction loans for small commercial development projects. Our construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is usually nine months for residential properties and 12 months for commercial properties. Upon completion of the construction phase, the loan typically converts to a permanent mortgage loan and is reclassified as such. Loans generally can be made with a maximum loan to value ratio of 90% on residential construction and 80% on commercial construction, based on appraised value as if complete. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. We also will require an inspection of the property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan.
 
Commercial Loans. We offer commercial business loans to professionals, sole proprietorships and small businesses in our market area. We offer installment loans for capital improvements, equipment acquisition and long-term working capital. These loans are secured by business assets other than real estate, such as business equipment and inventory, or are backed by the personal guarantee of the borrower. We originate lines of credit to finance the working capital needs of businesses to be repaid by seasonal cash flows or to provide a period of time during which the business can borrow funds for planned equipment purchases. We also offer accounts receivable lines of credit.
 
When making commercial business loans, we consider the financial statements of the borrower, the borrower’s payment history of both corporate and personal debt, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business, the viability of the industry in which the customer operates and the value of the collateral.
 
Consumer Loans. Our consumer loans consist primarily of home equity loans and lines of credit. We occasionally make loans secured by passbook or certificate accounts and automobile loans.
 
We offer home equity loans with a maximum combined loan to value ratio of 80% or less. Home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest that are indexed to the Prime Rate as published by The Wall Street Journal. Home equity loans have fixed interest rates and terms that typically range from five to 15 years. Some of our home equity loans are originated as five-year balloon loans with monthly payments based on a 20- to 30-year amortization schedule.
 
The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include an assessment of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicant’s creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount.
 
Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales. Loan originations come from a number of sources. The primary sources of loan originations are existing customers, walk-in traffic, advertising and referrals from customers.
 
From time to time, we have purchased participations in loans from the Thrift Institutions Community Investment Corporation of New Jersey and other banking institutions to supplement our lending portfolio. Loan participations totaled $1.3 million at March 31, 2017. Loan participations are also subject to the same credit analysis and loan approvals as loans we originate. We are permitted to review all of the documentation relating to any loan in which we participate. However, in a purchased participation loan, we do not service the loan and thus are subject to the policies and practices of the lead lender with regard to monitoring delinquencies, pursuing collections and instituting foreclosure proceedings.

In the past, we have sold some of the 30-year fixed rate loans that we originated to the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York for interest risk management purposes. In recent periods we have retained all of the loans that we have originated. We may sell loans from time to time in the future to help manage our asset/liability mix and limit our interest rate risk. We intend to retain the servicing on any loans sold.
 
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our board of directors and management. The board of directors has granted loan approval authority to our President and Chief Executive Officer up to prescribed limits, based on the officer’s experience and tenure. All loans over $500,000 with respect to residential mortgage loans and smaller amounts with respect to other types of loans must be approved by the loan committee of the board of directors or the full board.
 
Loans to One Borrower. The maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrower’s related entities is limited, by regulation, to generally 15% of our stated capital and reserves. At March 31, 2017, our regulatory limit on loans to one borrower was $1.9 million. At that date, our largest lending relationship was $1.75 million and was secured by a shopping center. This loan was performing in accordance with their terms at March 31, 2017.
 
Loan Commitments. We issue commitments for fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events. Commitments to originate mortgage loans are legally binding agreements to lend to our customers. Generally, our loan commitments expire after 60 days.
 
Loan Underwriting Risks.
 
Adjustable-Rate Loans. While we anticipate that adjustable-rate loans will better offset the adverse effects of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate mortgages, an increased monthly mortgage payment required of adjustable-rate loan borrowers in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of the underlying property also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment. In addition, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans make our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits.
 
Construction Loans. Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property’s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the building. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or before the maturity of the loan, with a building having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment. If we are forced to foreclose on a building before or at completion due to a default, there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs.
 
Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. Loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in commercial and multi-family real estate lending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent than residential real estate loans, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on income properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors, if any, to provide annual financial statements on commercial and multi-family real estate loans. In reaching a decision on whether to make a commercial or multi-family real estate loan, we consider and review a global cash flow analysis of the borrower and consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability and the value of the underlying property. We have generally required that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of earnings before debt service to debt service) of at least 1.25x. An environmental survey or environmental risk insurance is obtained when the possibility exists that hazardous materials may have existed on the site, or the site may have been impacted by adjoining properties that handled hazardous materials.

Commercial Loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value.
 
Consumer Loans. Consumer loans may entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such as motor vehicles. In the latter case, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and a small remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. Consumer loan collections depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are likely to be adversely affected by various factors, including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.
 
Investment Activities
 
We have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies and of state and municipal governments, mortgage-backed securities and certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions. Within certain regulatory limits, we also may invest a portion of our assets in corporate securities and mutual funds. We also are required to maintain an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and Atlantic Community Bankers Bank stock.
 
At March 31, 2017, our investment portfolio totaled $25.2 million, or 19.9% of total assets, and consisted primarily of mortgage-backed securities and debt securities of government sponsored enterprises.
 
Our investment objectives are to provide and maintain liquidity, to establish an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, to provide an alternate source of low-risk investments when demand for loans is weak and to generate a favorable return. Our board of directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of our investment policy. The Asset/Liability Committee is responsible for implementation of the investment policy and monitoring our investment performance. Our board of directors reviews the status of our investment portfolio on a monthly basis, or more frequently if warranted.
 
Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds
 
General. Deposits, borrowings and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions.
 
Deposit Accounts. Substantially all of our depositors are residents of New Jersey. Deposits are attracted from within our market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including non-interest-bearing demand deposits (such as checking accounts), interest-bearing demand accounts (such as NOW and money market accounts), savings accounts and certificates of deposit. In addition to accounts for individuals, we also offer commercial checking accounts designed for the businesses operating in our market area. We do not have any brokered deposits. From time to time we promote various accounts in an effort to increase deposits.
 
Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, our liquidity needs, profitability to us, and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit mix and pricing bi-weekly. Our deposit pricing strategy has generally been to offer competitive rates and to be towards the top of the local market for rates on all types of deposit products.

Borrowings. We have the ability to utilize advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, Atlantic Community Bankers Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia to supplement our investable funds. The Federal Home Loan Bank functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution’s net worth or on the Federal Home Loan Bank’s assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness. Atlantic Central Bankers Bank provides correspondent banking services, both credit and noncredit, to financial institutions in the Mid-Atlantic region. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in Atlantic Central Bankers Bank and are authorized to apply for advances under an unsecured line of credit. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions. We are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. At March 31, 2017, we had arrangements to borrow up to $10.4 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and $1 million from the Atlantic Central Bankers Bank.
 

Personnel
 
As of March 31, 2017, we had 21 full-time equivalent employees, none of whom is represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
Subsidiaries
 
The only subsidiary of Delanco Bancorp is Delanco Federal. Delanco Federal has two active subsidiaries, DFSB Properties, LLC, and DFSB Properties II, LLC which are the title holders for repossessed real estate.
Regulation and Supervision
 
General
 
Delanco Federal, as a federal savings association, is currently subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC, as its primary federal regulator, and by the FDIC as the insurer of its deposits. Delanco Federal is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. Delanco Federal must file reports with the OCC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals before entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations by the OCC to evaluate Delanco Federal’s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulatory structure is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of an adequate allowance for loan losses for regulatory purposes. Any change in such policies, whether by the OCC, the FDIC or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on Delanco Bancorp and Delanco Federal and their operations.
 
Certain of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to Delanco Federal and Delanco Bancorp are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Delanco Federal and Delanco Bancorp.
 
Federal Banking Regulation
 
Business Activities. The activities of federal savings banks, such as Delanco Federal, are governed by federal laws and regulations. Those laws and regulations delineate the nature and extent of the business activities in which federal savings banks may engage. In particular, certain lending authority for federal savings banks, e.g., commercial, non-residential real property loans and consumer loans, is limited to a specified percentage of the institution’s capital or assets.

Capital Requirements. The minimum capital level requirements applicable to Delanco Bancorp and Delanco Federal are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The capital adequacy rules also establish a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital and will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations would establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. 
 
The OCC also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution’s capital level is or may become inadequate in light of particular risks or circumstances.
 
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept broker deposits. The OCC is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s degree of undercapitalization. In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution, including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. The OCC could also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. Significantly and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional mandatory and discretionary measures.
 
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Delanco Federal’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. Deposit insurance per account owner is currently $250,000. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations. Institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. The FDIC may adjust the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment. The FDIC has set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. 
 
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Delanco Federal. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.
 
Loans to One Borrower. Federal law provides that savings associations are generally subject to the limits on loans to one borrower applicable to national banks. Generally, subject to certain exceptions, a savings association may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by specified readily-marketable collateral.
 
Qualified Thrift Lender Test. Federal law requires savings associations to meet a qualified thrift lender test. Under the test, a savings association is required to either qualify as a “domestic building and loan association” under the Internal Revenue Code or maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” (total assets less: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) intangibles, including goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed securities but also including education, credit card and small business loans) in at least nine months out of each 12-month period.
 
A savings association that fails the qualified thrift lender test is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be subject to an enforcement action and dividend limitations. As of March 31, 2017, Delanco Federal maintained 95.7% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and, therefore, met the qualified thrift lender test.

Limitation on Capital Distributions. Federal regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by a savings association, including cash dividends, payments to repurchase its shares and payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash-out merger. Under the regulations, an application to and the prior approval of the OCC is required before any capital distribution if the institution does not meet the criteria for “expedited treatment” of applications under OCC regulations (i.e., generally, examination and Community Reinvestment Act ratings in the two top categories), the total capital distributions for the calendar year exceed net income for that year plus the amount of retained net income for the preceding two years, the institution would be undercapitalized following the distribution or the distribution would otherwise be contrary to a statute, regulation or agreement with the OCC. If an application is not required, the institution must still provide 30 days prior written notice to, and receive the non-objection of, the Federal Reserve Board of the capital distribution if, like Delanco Federal, it is a subsidiary of a holding company, as well as an informational notice filing to the OCC. If Delanco Federal’s capital ever fell below its regulatory requirements or the OCC notified it that it was in need of increased supervision, its ability to make capital distributions could be restricted. In addition, the OCC could prohibit a proposed capital distribution by any institution, which would otherwise be permitted by the regulation, if the OCC determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.
 
Community Reinvestment Act. All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. An institution’s failure to satisfactorily comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could result in denials of regulatory applications. Responsibility for administering the Community Reinvestment Act, unlike other fair lending laws, is not being transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Delanco Federal received an “outstanding” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed examination.
 
Transactions with Related Parties. Federal law limits Delanco Federal’s authority to engage in transactions with “affiliates” (e.g., any entity that controls or is under common control with Delanco Federal, including Delanco Bancorp and its other subsidiaries). The aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the capital and surplus of the savings association. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the savings association’s capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type specified by federal law. The purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Transactions with affiliates must generally be on terms and under circumstances that are at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. In addition, savings associations are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings association may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary.
 
Delanco Bancorp is generally prohibited from making loans to its executive officers and directors. However, the law contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws. Delanco Federal’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders (“insiders”), as well as entities such persons control, is limited based, in part, on Delanco Federal’s capital level and compliance with certain Board approval procedures. Loans to insiders are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and cannot involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to executive officers and directors over other employees. Loans to executive officers are subject to additional limitations based on the type of loan involved.
 
Enforcement. The OCC currently has primary enforcement responsibility over savings associations and has authority to bring actions against the institution and all institution-affiliated parties, including shareholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful actions likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors to institution of receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to $25,000 per day, or even $1.0 million per day in especially egregious cases. The FDIC has the authority to recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings association. If action is not taken by the OCC, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain circumstances. Federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations.
 
Federal Home Loan Bank System. Delanco Federal is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Delanco Federal, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in that Federal Home Loan Bank. Delanco Federal was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank stock at March 31, 2017 of $124 thousand.

Federal Reserve Board System. The Federal Reserve Board regulations require savings associations to maintain non-interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) and regular checking accounts). The regulations generally provide that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: a 3% reserve ratio is assessed on net transaction accounts up to and including $115.1 million; a 10% reserve ratio is applied above $115.1 million. The first $15.5 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements. Delanco Federal complies with the foregoing requirements.

Holding Company Regulation
 
General. As a savings and loan holding company, Delanco Bancorp is subject to Federal Reserve Board regulations, examinations, supervision, reporting requirements and regulations regarding its activities. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to Delanco Federal.
 
Pursuant to federal law and regulations and policy, a savings and loan holding company such as Delanco Bancorp may generally engage in the activities permitted for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act and certain other activities that have been authorized for savings and loan holding companies by regulation.
 
Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company from, directly or indirectly or through one or more subsidiaries, acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of another savings association, or savings and loan holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board or from acquiring or retaining, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary holding company or savings association. A savings and loan holding company is also prohibited from acquiring more than 5% of a company engaged in activities other than those authorized by federal law or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the FDIC. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings associations, the Federal Reserve Board must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.

The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings associations in more than one state, except: (i) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and (ii) the acquisition of a savings association in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings association specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.
 
Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The regulatory agencies must promulgate regulations implementing the “source of strength” policy that holding companies act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.
 
Dividends. The Federal Reserve Board has the power to prohibit dividends by savings and loan holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which also applies to savings and loan holding companies and which expresses the Federal Reserve Board’s view that a holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company’s bank subsidiary is classified as “undercapitalized.”
 
Acquisition of Delanco Bancorp. Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a savings and loan holding company or savings association. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the company or institution, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in a change of control. Under the Change in Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Any company that acquires control would then be subject to regulation as a savings and loan holding company.
 
Regulatory Agreement
 
Delanco Federal is a party to a formal written agreement with the OCC dated November 21, 2012. The written agreement supersedes and terminates the Order to Cease and Desist issued by the Office of Thrift Supervision on March 17, 2010.
 
The written agreement requires Delanco Federal to take the following actions:
 

● | prepare a three-year strategic plan that establishes objectives for Delanco Federal’s overall risk profile, earnings performance, growth, balance sheet mix, liability structure, reduction in the volume of nonperforming assets, and product line development; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | prepare a capital plan that includes specific proposals related to the maintenance of adequate capital, identifies strategies to strengthen capital if necessary and includes detailed quarterly financial projections. If the OCC determines that Delanco Federal has failed to submit an acceptable capital plan or fails to implement or adhere to its capital plan, then the OCC may require Delanco Federal to develop a contingency capital plan detailing Delanco Federal’s proposal to sell, merge or liquidate Delanco Federal;
● | prepare a criticized asset plan that will include strategies, targets and timeframes to reduce Delanco Federal’s level of criticized assets;

● | implement a plan to improve Delanco Federal’s credit risk management and credit administration practices; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | implement programs and policies related to Delanco Federal’s allowance for loan and lease losses, liquidity risk management, independent loan review and other real estate owned;
● | review the capabilities of Delanco Federal’s management to perform present and anticipated duties and to recommend and implement any changes based on such assessment; 
● | not pay any dividends or make any other capital distributions without the prior written approval of the OCC; 
● | not make any severance or indemnification payments without complying with regulatory requirements regarding such payments; and 
● | comply with prior regulatory notification requirements for any changes in directors or senior executive officers. 

  
We have submitted strategic and capital plans to the OCC and have developed the other plans and policies required by the written agreement. The written agreement will remain in effect until terminated, modified, or suspended in writing by the OCC.
 
The written agreement does not require Delanco Federal to maintain any specific minimum regulatory capital ratios. However, by letter dated January 2, 2013, the OCC established higher individual minimum capital requirements for Delanco Federal. Specifically, Delanco Federal must maintain Tier 1 capital at least equal to 8% of adjusted total assets, Tier 1 capital at least equal to 12% of risk-weighted assets, and total capital at least equal to 13% of risk-weighted assets. At March 31, 2017, Delanco Federal’s Tier 1 leverage capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and total risk-based capital ratio were 9.23%, 16.34% and 17.6%, respectively.
