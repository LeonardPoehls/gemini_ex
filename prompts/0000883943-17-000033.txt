We operate an integrated, omni-channel business platform that is designed to provide customers a seamless retail experience with the ability to shop when and where they want, including retail stores, outlet stores, online and mobile. This allows our customers to browse, purchase, return, or exchange our merchandise through the channel that is optimal for her.

Unless otherwise noted, the use of the terms “the Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to Christopher & Banks Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Christopher & Banks, Inc. and Christopher & Banks Company.

Our Brand

Christopher & Banks Corporation was incorporated in 1986 to acquire Braun’s Fashions, Inc., which had operated as a family-owned business since 1956. We became a publicly traded corporation in 1992 and, in July 2000, our stockholders approved a company name change from Braun’s Fashions Corporation to Christopher & Banks Corporation. Christopher & Banks caters to missy and petite sized customers. In 2000, we introduced our women’s plus sized collection under the name C.J. Banks.

We offer merchandise assortments that reflect a balance of novelty and basic core pieces, at affordable prices. We emphasize comfort and easy care in classic and relevant fashions with a consistent fit. To differentiate ourselves from our competitors, our buyers, working in conjunction with our product development teams, strive to create a merchandise assortment of coordinated outfits, the majority of which are manufactured exclusively for us under our proprietary Christopher & Banks ® and C.J. Banks ® names.

Our Store Formats

Our Christopher and Banks (“CB”) stores offer merchandise assortments in women’s apparel and accessories for missy sizes 4 to 16 and petite sizes 4P to 16P.

Our C.J. Banks (“CJ”) stores offer merchandise assortments in similar women’s apparel and accessories for women’s sizes 14W to 26W.

Our Missy, Petite, Women (“MPW”) stores, outlet stores, and online store offer merchandise assortments from both Christopher and Banks and C.J. Banks in all three size ranges resulting in greater opportunity to service our customers and improve our store productivity.

Offer a differentiated product assortment
We are committed to ensuring we consistently meet our customers’ needs with a differentiated merchandise assortment that fits her lifestyle at a recognizable value. We intend to increase the flow of our fashion offering and provide a more versatile assortment to encourage our customers to shop more frequently and buy more when she visits. To further support the newness of our merchandise presentations, we are analyzing our promotional cadence and adjusting our markdown strategy to emphasize rapid inventory turnover to keep merchandise fresh and current. 
Increase customer loyalty, acquire new customers, and recapture lapsed customers
We have a very loyal customer base that is highly engaged. As such, we will continue to leverage our direct and digital marketing channels to encourage additional customer visits and increased spending per visit. 
We continue to be focused on maximizing the benefits of our customer relationship management (“CRM”) database, Friendship Rewards Loyalty Program (“Friendship Rewards”), and private-label credit card program to strengthen engagement with our customers. Our Friendship Rewards program, in conjunction with our CRM system, allows us to personalize communications and customize our offers.
We are accelerating our efforts to re-engage customers that stopped shopping following the migration of their local CB or CJ store to the MPW format through targeted communications. We are also working to gain new customers and brand awareness through increased investments in digital paid media, and earned media. Additionally, progress is being made to increase the frequency of store grass root events that will continue to capitalize on the strong relationships between our store associates and customers. In fiscal 2017, we plan to launch a “refer a friend” program to incentivize customers to introduce their friends to our brand.
Leverage Our Omni-Channel Capabilities
We will capitalize on investments made in our integrated, omni-channel strategy which is designed to provide customers a seamless retail experience together with the ability to shop when and where they want, including retail stores, outlet stores, online and mobile. These investments enable us to address multiple customer touch points to drive spend and build brand affinity by providing a comprehensive view of our customer and our merchandise assortment and depth.
In fiscal 2017, we expect continued growth in eCommerce by leveraging our new platform launched in fiscal 2016, including improving personalization and enhanced site experiences. New omni-channel capabilities, including new fulfillment functionality, store grading and localized assortment planning, will support improved management of the receipt, allocation, and distribution of merchandise.
Our Merchandise

Our merchandise assortments include mostly exclusive designs of women’s apparel, generally consisting of casual clothing, everyday basics, wear-to-work, leisure / active wear, and seasonal sleepwear in missy, petite and women sizes. The Company also offers a selection of jewelry and accessories to complement our customer’s wardrobe.

While each store offers a base merchandise assortment, store assortments vary to reflect individual store demands and local market preferences. We design our products and merchandise them in our stores and through our website in a coordinated manner intended to drive the number of units per transaction. On average, our customers purchase two to three items per transaction.

Our Operations

All of the Company operations are located in the United States. Merchandise selection, pricing and promotions, procurement and sourcing, marketing and advertising, and labor deployment across all channels are centrally managed at our corporate headquarters. In addition, functional support capabilities (e.g. human resources, finance, legal) are also performed at our corporate location. We also have field operations that support our retail teams. Our retail stores have procedures for transaction processing, customer experience, merchandise display, inventory management, asset protection, and staff training.
Our Stores

As of January 28, 2017, we operated 484 stores in 45 states. The following table illustrates the change in store count and store format by fiscal year:

Store Count Rollforward | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 | | 2013 | | 2012 | 
Stores as beginning of year | 518 | | 518 | | 560 | | 608 | | 686 | 
Opened | 9 | | 42 | | 23 | | 8 | | 7 | 
Closed | (27 | ) | (19 | ) | (21 | ) | (35 | ) | (85 | )
Conversions | (16 | ) | (23 | ) | (44 | ) | (21 | ) | — | 
Stores at end of year | 484 | | 518 | | 518 | | 560 | | 608 | 


Stores by Format | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012
MPW | 318 | 314 | 216 | 61 | 40 
Outlet | 82 | 77 | 44 | 31 | 25 
Christopher and Banks | 43 | 67 | 173 | 333 | 383 
CJ Banks | 41 | 60 | 85 | 135 | 160 
Total Stores | 484 | 518 | 518 | 560 | 608 

We continue to evaluate the timing of converting the remaining CB stores and CJ stores to MPW stores. MPW stores provide a unified store format that simplifies merchandising and allocations processes, enhances the customer experience, and enables more economies of scale across functions.
Outlet stores play a distinct role in the store fleet and are an important growth lever. These stores enable us to expand our customer reach to new geographies and heighten brand awareness among existing and new customers. Our outlet stores contain a mixture of base store merchandise, made-for-outlet merchandise, and clearance merchandise. Due to the significant growth in the number of outlets in the past two years coupled with softening financial results, our focus in the near term will shift to stabilizing and improving this channel's productivity. Progress is expected to be made through a differentiated product assortment, including increased depth in novelty fashion items, at a compelling price value proposition. Work is underway to optimize the flow of clearance inventory to outlets ahead of key holiday periods. These outlet initiatives will be managed through the allocation of additional resources.

Our Website

Our website at www.christopherandbanks.com provides customers the ability to browse our offerings, locate our stores, and order merchandise online. Our website is designed to be an extension of our brand and is key to our developing omni-channel strategy. The online merchandise assortment consists of a combination of exclusive styles as well as special sizes and lengths. We offer online customers the option to return items in our stores. In fiscal 2016, we launched our new eCommerce website to serve as a valuable tool for our customers and to provide improved product and visual presentation, additional site navigation tools, a simplified check out process, and product recommendations. In fiscal 2017, we expect to leverage our new website capabilities to facilitate continued growth in on-line sales.
Competition

The women’s retail apparel business is highly competitive and includes regional, national and international department stores, specialty stores, boutique stores, catalog companies, and online retailers. Many of these competitors have greater name recognition and some of these competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources compared to us. We compete in the specialty retail space by offering unique, classic and versatile clothing that fits her everyday needs at a good value. We believe our visual merchandise presentation, attentive customer service and physical store locations supplement our compelling value proposition.
Global Sourcing and Product Sourcing

We utilize a broad base of manufacturers located throughout the world that we believe produce goods at the level of quality that our customers desire at a competitive cost. For the most recently completed fiscal year, our ten largest suppliers accounted for approximately 73% of the merchandise we purchased, and our two largest suppliers accounted for 28% and 9% of our goods respectively.

We purchase our merchandise using individual purchase orders and, therefore, are not subject to long-term production contracts with any of our vendors, manufacturers, or buying agents. We intend to continue our efforts to optimize our purchasing power with consideration for the potential risk of limiting our manufacturing flexibility.

We may take ownership of product in the foreign country where the factory is located, at a designated point of entry into the United States, or at our distribution center depending on the specific terms of the sale. Most of our sourcing activities are performed by a single-shared sourcing and procurement function. We believe that this function, working in concert with our key supply chain partners, will deliver high quality apparel and accessories at a lower cost while providing the opportunity to minimize freight costs through consolidation. We believe that the decision to centralize our sourcing and procurement operations has helped us mitigate the impact of higher sourcing costs.

Typical lead times for delivery of our merchandise are 90 to 150 days from the date of order placement, however we have the ability to expedite the sourcing of merchandise in those cases where we see an opportunity to garner incremental sales on those items that have resonated with our customer. In addition, we will make purchases domestically when demand warrants.

We expect product costs, including the cost of cotton, to remain relatively constant in fiscal 2017.

Merchandise Distribution

We centrally distribute most of our products sold in our stores from our distribution center located in Plymouth, Minnesota. New merchandise is generally received each week day at our corporate distribution center. After arrival, merchandise is sorted and packaged for shipment to individual stores or is held for future store replenishment. Merchandise is generally pre-ticketed with price and related informational tags at the point of manufacture.
Merchandise is typically shipped to our stores via third-party delivery services multiple times per week, providing our stores with a steady flow of new inventory.

Merchandise sold through our eCommerce channel is delivered directly to the customer through a third-party service provider.

Information Technology

Our information technology strategy is intended to provide a platform for an integrated, omni-channel retail experience. Our information systems are designed to enable us to obtain, analyze, and take action on information in a timely fashion. We are committed to leveraging technology to maintain effective financial and operational controls.

We continue to make investments in capabilities that will allow us to better manage the flow of product. Existing and anticipated system enhancements are intended to allow our teams to analyze store-level data to tailor the merchandise assortment to the demographics of the surrounding community. We expect these insights will lead to improved merchandise assortments thereby generating higher unit velocity and improved average unit retail, which should translate into higher merchandise margins.

We are committed to evolving change management and portfolio management processes and standards to improve the security of our data and our customers’ information as well as to maintain effective financial and operational controls. We have established an information security infrastructure and methodology which can adapt to the evolving needs of the business in an effort to ensure the appropriate safeguarding of assets and secure and reliable customer transactions.
In fiscal 2016, we made significant investments in our omni-channel capabilities, including the roll out of a new point-of-sale system and the launch of a new eCommerce website. In fiscal 2017, we expect to leverage these investments to further enable us to address multiple customer touch points to drive spend and build brand affinity.

Employees

As of January 28, 2017, we employed approximately 4,100 associates, approximately 32% of whom were full-time employees and the balance of whom were part-time employees. The number of part-time employees fluctuates during peak selling periods. Approximately 220 of our associates are employed at our corporate office and distribution center facility, with the majority of the associate population employed in our store field organization. We have no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees, have never experienced a work stoppage and are unaware of any efforts or plans to organize our employees. We consider relations with our employees to be good. 
Trademarks and Service Marks

We are the owner of certain registered and common law trademarks and service marks (collectively referred to as “Marks”).

5

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Christopher & Banks Company, is the owner of the federally registered Marks “christopher & banks ®,” which is our predominant private brand, and “cj banks ®,” our private brand for women sizes 14W to 26W.

In the opinion of management, our rights in the Marks are important to our business and are recognized in the women’s retail apparel industry. Accordingly, we intend to maintain our Marks and the related registrations and applications. U.S. trademark registrations are for a term of ten years and are renewable every ten years as long as the trademarks are used in the regular course of trade. We are not aware of any claims of infringement or other challenges to our rights to use any registered Marks in the United States.

Seasonality

Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly depending on a number of factors, including general economic conditions, consumer confidence, customer response to our seasonal merchandise mix, timing of new store openings, adverse weather conditions, and shifts in the timing of certain holidays and promotional events. 
Working Capital

We fund our business operations through a combination of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs, for general corporate purposes and investment opportunities.

Effective inventory management is critical to our success. We employ various methods to manage inventory levels including demand forecasting, optimal allocations, and various forms of inventory replenishment. We seek to minimize markdowns through effective inventory management.
