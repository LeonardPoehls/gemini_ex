ITEM 1. Business
Overview 
CafePress Inc. (the "Company," "we," "us," "our") is a provider of gifts and expressories. We take pride in helping to facilitate human connections by inspiring people to express themselves with the best assortment of engaging merchandise. We were founded in 1999 as a California corporation, we reincorporated in Delaware in 2005 and we completed our initial public offering in April 2012. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "PRSS".
We are a leading provider of personalized products offering a wide variety of expressive gifts and accessories, including t-shirts and apparel, mugs and drinkware and home goods such as custom shower curtains and bed coverings. We conduct most of our business on our primary United States-based domain, CafePress.com and operate CafePress branded websites for markets in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. We also sell CafePress branded products in the United States and various locations in Europe through our online retail partners such as Amazon and Walmart. Our products are customized with expressive designs

contributed through a variety of means, including crowd-sourced user generated content, stock art licenses and licensed content relationships with large entertainment companies and brands. Our distinctive items bring our customers' passions to life and connect people to each other.
Our production facility and fulfillment center in Louisville, Kentucky has innovative technology and manufacturing processes that enable us to provide high-quality customized products that are individually built to order. Our proprietary processes enable us to produce a broad range of merchandise efficiently and profitably. We also maintain a diverse network of contract manufacturers that give us the ability to broaden our manufacturing capabilities and produce in certain international locales.
Most of our net revenue is generated from sales of customized products through our e-commerce websites (collectively referred to as "CafePress.com"), associated Retail Partner Channel ("Retail Partner Channel") or through storefronts hosted by CafePress ("Shop"). In addition, we currently generate limited revenue from third-party printing and fulfillment services. Customized products include user-designed products as well as products designed by our content owners.
E-Commerce Platform Products and Services 
We receive content from a wide variety of sources, including user-generated content, licensed content from various properties and content from stock photo sources. These products are digitally rendered for consumers onto a variety of base goods, and the combination of the content and base good creates the range of products offered on CafePress.com.
On CafePress.com, these products and the associated metadata are marketed to draw both search engine and direct traffic. Prices are established by us, and we control the marketing. 
User-generated content can also be created on CafePress.com for self-purchase or to be sold. If user-generated content is to be sold to others, the content generator is called a Shopkeeper and may be paid a commission in one of two ways. The predominant way in which a commission is earned consists of Shopkeepers benefiting from a percentage of sales of their content sold on CafePress.com or through our Retail Partner Channel as determined by published terms and conditions. Commission rates typically range from 5% to 11% of sales. The Shopkeeper can also elect to create a Shop and can use a suite of tools to provide a unique e-commerce experience, establish their own markup above our standard product pricing and drive their own marketing. As Shopkeepers drive their own traffic and establish their own markup for their Shop, the commission is typically higher than that earned on CafePress.com.
Our Retail Partner Channel typically refers to the fact that we are generating revenue from sources other than CafePress.com or our related websites.  Retail Partner refers to the distribution of our more popular content and products to other e-commerce retail websites such as Amazon and Walmart. During 2017, we increased our product catalog with Walmart and we expanded our Amazon partner channel into additional locations in Europe. 
Whether sold on CafePress.com, through a Shop or through our Retail Partner Channel, the resulting order is electronically communicated to our fulfillment center in Louisville, Kentucky, and then routed to the appropriate location to be manufactured on-demand. Most of our goods are manufactured in Louisville, Kentucky, however we do have fulfillment arrangements with other third-parties with different product expertise, or geographical advantages such as operations in Europe, Australia and Canada. Products are then produced and shipped from the appropriate fulfillment location. 
We generate the majority of revenue from CafePress.com. By controlling the production process in our manufacturing facility, we can produce high-quality products, innovate quickly, maintain a favorable cost structure and ensure timely shipments to customers during our peak periods of demand. We generate approximately 90% of our revenue from sales originating in the United States and our sales are seasonally driven as we generate approximately 40% of our total revenue during our fiscal fourth quarter.
Business and Marketing Strategy
Our goal is to help individuals establish connections and celebrate their identities, interests and affinities through unique products and content. The desire to personalize products and express affinity through the things individuals surround themselves with, whether they are decorating their apparel, their home or office, remains strong, and as we improve the quality of our execution and services, we believe we can eventually capture more of that demand. To reach new and existing customers, we rely on consumer awareness of our brand and use a variety of integrated marketing programs, including search engine marketing, search engine optimization, social media, e-mail and other forms of online marketing.
Key elements of our strategy, both in 2017 and going forward, to achieve this goal include:

• | Rebuild the User Experience. A key aspect of our ability to improve our retention and customer counts is to provide a site that removes as much friction from the purchasing funnel as possible. Updates to the website began to be released in 2017, starting with a new homepage. We focused on refreshing stale content, updated XML sitemaps and streamlined our link architecture which will enhance crawlability for search engines. During 2018, we plan to complete our website rebuild with an upgrade to a fully encrypted HTTPS site and new search, product details, cart page and checkout pages. We believe the new website will result in higher traffic, conversion and revenue from search engine optimization channels. 


• | Retail Partner Channel Expansion. We intend to support growth in our Retail Partner Channel by further expanding into new marketplaces and geographies, focusing on product discoverability and an enhanced customer experience that includes detailed product descriptions, photographs, reviews and refined pricing and promotions. During 2017, we expanded into Germany, Italy, France and Spain domains through Amazon and launched our initial product catalog with Walmart.com. During 2018, we will expand further with Amazon into their Australian domain. 


• | Third-Party Printing and Fulfillment. In 2017, we implemented a $1.5 million garment printing platform upgrade to improve throughput, drive efficiency and increase capacity. We believe we can leverage our manufacturing platform and excess capacity to enter into new fulfillment agreements with other third-party consumer-facing, on-demand, custom product providers. We are focused on acquiring new fulfillment customers to generate additional revenue for CafePress. 


• | Maintain Financial Discipline. We manage our business activities with a focus on profitability growth. In February of 2018, we announced a $4 million cost reduction plan and we will align our cost structure to maintain discipline in our operations and conserve our cash balances. 

Technology and Production Systems 
We use a combination of proprietary and third-party technology, including the following:

• | Website System. We have designed our website systems to be secure and highly available using cloud-based hosting and a virtualized server architecture. We can easily scale to increasing numbers of customers cost-effectively by adding capacity through this approach. We have a strong commitment to our privacy policy, and we utilize technologies such as firewalls and encryption technology for secure transmission of personal information between customers' computers and our website and intrusion detection systems. 


• | Image Archive. We store our customers' images in our image archive. Once a customer uploads a photo to our website, it is copied to multiple redundant systems. We continue to expand our storage capacity to meet increasing customer demand. Our innovative storage architecture is cost-effective, facilitates the safe and secure archiving of customers' images and delivers the speed and performance required to create products in real-time. 


• | Image Review. Our in-house system examines the content of an image and returns metadata that we utilize to run a product creation engine. This system produces the best quality image for the product selected. 


• | Production System. We operate our production facility in Louisville, Kentucky. Our single piece flow automated production system efficiently controls our production processes, including order management and pick, pack and shipping operations. Using proprietary algorithms, the production system analyzes thousands of orders daily and automates the workflow into our state-of-the-art digital printers. We also use third-party print on demand partners internationally to assist with the speed of delivery and to help control fulfillment costs. 

Competition
The market for customized products and services is large, fragmented and intensely competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future. We face competition from a wide range of companies, including the following:

• | Small, traditional offline printing, gifting and souvenir businesses for apparel, accessories, home, or other customized products;


• | E-commerce companies, including large online retailers and marketplaces such as Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Target and eBay (who may also be part of our Retail Partner Channel);


• | Online providers of customized products such as RedBubble Inc., CustomInk LLC, Spreadshirt Inc., TeeSpring or Zazzle Inc. as well as providers of distinctive goods like Etsy, Inc. or Uncommon Goods LLC;

• | Online providers allowing users to customize goods in specific vertical markets, such as Cimpress N.V. for small businesses and Shutterfly, Inc. for photographic products;


• | Physical and catalog retailers of personalized merchandise such as Red Envelope and Things Remembered; and


• | Small, but numerous, online providers who address niche customization services and product offerings, enabled by advances in digital printing technologies.

We also indirectly compete with Internet portals and shopping search engines that are involved in e-commerce or sell products or services either directly or in collaboration with other retailers, and our reliance on Internet portals and other sources of Internet and referral traffic, such as Facebook, impacts both the way we do business and our performance against competitors. Changes to their practices could drive traffic to our competitors and away from our e-commerce sites in ways we may not anticipate or that will cause us to expend further resources to successfully compete. The shift to mobile site access prevalence presents challenges as we cope with adapting our site to shifting traffic patterns and the different use characteristics, which include lower average order size, amongst others. Furthermore, to the extent that other companies are able to replicate our processes or if advances in print-on-demand technologies reduce any technological or other early mover leads we may have, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.
Some of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, marketing, technology and other resources than us, including significant brand recognition, sales volume and customer bases. In addition, other online retailers may be acquired by, receive investment from or enter into strategic relationships with, well-established and well-financed companies or investors that would help enhance their competitive positions. Some of our competitors may be able to secure goods and raw materials from suppliers on more favorable terms, devote greater resources to marketing activities and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and system development than us. Increased competition may reduce our operating margins, market share and brand recognition, or force us to incur losses. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry include:

• | Competitive pricing;


• | Technological expertise;


• | Quality, breadth and type of the products sold and services offered;


• | Ease of use and convenience of our services;


• | Effective marketing and distribution;


• | Ability to anticipate and quickly adapt to changing customer demands and customer service needs;


• | Ability to source products efficiently and cost effectively; and


• | Favorable brand recognition and trust.

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors.
Intellectual Property
We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights, as well as employee and third-party confidentiality and invention agreements to safeguard our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2017, we had seven issued patents and one patent application pending in the United States generally covering our e-commerce services or proprietary printing and decorating services and our online platform for designing and generating framed products. We continually assess appropriate occasions for seeking patent protection for those aspects of our technology, designs and methodologies and processes that we believe may ultimately provide significant competitive advantages.
As of December 31, 2017, we held 19 U.S. trademark registrations (some of which are registered in multiple classes), which include, among others, CAFEPRESS.COM, CAFEPRESS, and the “cafepress” logo. We are in the process of registering additional trademarks supporting our business and we also claim common law trademark rights in numerous trademarks. We have registered our CAFEPRESS.COM and CAFEPRESS trademarks in numerous countries in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and North America. 
Our patents expire at various times between November 2025 and June 2031. In addition, in accordance with U.S. federal trademark law, our registered trademarks are registered for an initial period of 10 years, subject to subsequent 10-year renewal periods. We currently intend to maintain the registration of our trademarks indefinitely. We also register trademarks in dozens of international jurisdictions and likewise plan to renew our trademark registrations indefinitely wherever we conduct business. In the ordinary 
4

course of our business, we enter into hundreds of license agreements with content partners for the license of published entertainment content and consumer brands. We are not dependent on any specific content license agreement in the conduct of our business. We also license various forms of third-party technologies in the provision of our e-commerce services. We believe we have multiple sources for third-party technologies used in our business, and if we were to change licensors for any reasons, it would result in minimal disruption to our operations, if any. 
Our standard content license agreement is typically for a term of three years, subject to termination in the event of an uncured material breach of either party and renewable for one year terms thereafter. Our third-party technology licenses are typically for a term of one to two years, with optional renewal clauses upon mutual agreement of the parties. 
We also rely upon certain unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise, licensed third-party technologies, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. For certain of our proprietary know-how and processes, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality and invention agreements to safeguard our interests. We believe that many elements of our system, including technical processes, equipment and system designs, algorithms and procedures, which relate to our software controls, manufacturing process and methods of system design involve proprietary know-how, technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications. We have taken security measures to protect these elements. For example, all of our research and development personnel are required to enter into proprietary information and inventions agreements with us. These agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions, designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us. We also require our customers and business partners to enter into non-disclosure agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology, proprietary processes, sales data or business plans.
Government Regulation
The legal environment of the Internet is evolving rapidly in the United States and around the world. The manner in which existing laws and regulations will be applied to the Internet in general, and how they will relate to our business in particular, are often unclear in many cases. For example, we often cannot be certain how existing laws will apply in the e-commerce and online context, including with respect to such topics as privacy, defamation, pricing, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, sweepstakes, promotions, content regulation, quality of products and services and intellectual property ownership and infringement. 
The nature of our user-generated content business models presents legal challenges to our business and operations. Our content usage policy and policies surrounding infringement of intellectual property rights or the rights of third parties, such as rights of privacy and publicity, play a key role in our business operations and the systems and practices that support them are particularly important to our business, operations and reputation. Both in the United States and internationally, we must monitor and comply with a host of legal concerns regarding the content-based nature of our business. As an e-commerce platform, the scope of liability for third-party content uploaded to our site for sale on printed products requires analysis of varying definitions of political speech, hate speech, pornography, profanity and obscenity, among other speech-related concerns. We likewise must monitor our e-commerce platform for potential and alleged intellectual property infringement and violation of rights of privacy and publicity that can vary widely between countries and regions, and, accordingly, we frequently must navigate the legal and regulatory schemes of numerous countries outside the United States. Our ability to employ processes to quickly remove infringing or offending content from our automated upload website is an important tool in protecting us from exposure for the potentially infringing activities of our users worldwide. 
Numerous laws and regulatory schemes have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States, and in some cases internationally, have a direct impact on our business and operations. These laws include the following: 

• | The Copyright Act of 1976 and all of the statutes and regulations associated with and enforced by the United States Patent and Trademark Office which protect the rights of third parties from infringement by users of our service. We maintain an automated service whereby users can upload any content they designate for use in creating customized products, but we likewise maintain content usage policies that prohibit intellectual property rights infringement or infringement of the rights of others, including rights of privacy and publicity. We maintain a robust Intellectual Property Rights policy and a proactive support operation which responds to and manages take-down requests and other concerns relating to third-party intellectual property that might appear on our sites despite policies forbidding the practice. As our business expands to other countries, we must respond to regional and country-specific intellectual property considerations, including take down and cease and desist notices in foreign languages and we must continue to build infrastructure to support these processes globally. 


• | The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which provides relief for claims of infringement as it relates to circumvention of copyright protected technologies, but also includes a safe harbor intended to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others. We 

5

maintain DMCA-complaint practices for notice and take-down as well as other required practices such as repeat offender management. 

• | The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and similar laws adopted by a number of states, which regulate unsolicited commercial e-mails, create criminal penalties for unmarked sexually-oriented material and e-mails containing fraudulent headers and control other abusive online marketing practices. Similarly, the guidelines of the Federal Trade Commission imposes responsibilities upon us for communications with respect to consumers and imposes fines and liability for failure to comply with rules with respective advertising or marketing practices they may deem misleading or deceptive. Further, the European Union, or the E.U., also maintains standards and regulations with respect to communications with consumers that we must comply with as we expand our marketing practices into those countries. 


• | Numerous product safety and environmental regulations that apply to the manufacture, sale and distribution of products and apply to our products and services to varying degrees based on the individual types of products sold through our portfolio of e-commerce websites and the inks used in our decorating processes. These regulations include, without limitation, the Consumer Product Safety Act, The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, California Proposition 65, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, as well as a number of other federal and state product safety and environmental regulatory schemes. Product safety regulations applicable to the E.U. in particular, where the majority of our international sales is currently shipped, are often more stringent than those in the United States and we therefore must evaluate and test applicable products to E.U. standards with respect to products intended for distribution in those markets. 


• | The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act) and other state laws and regulations that relate to credit card and gift certificate use fairness, including expiration dates and fees, as well as state laws surrounding escheat and abandonment of unclaimed property.


• | In the United States and internationally, we must evaluate tax liabilities from transactions on our portfolio of e-commerce websites and maintain finance infrastructure to support the collection and remittance of applicable sales taxes. In the United States, sales tax nexus issues with respect to Internet sales to consumers in states where we do not have a physical presence, which create potential nexus through affiliate program marketing activities and other nascent efforts to imply tax nexus on royalties payable on content licenses. This regulation continues to be an area of great uncertainty and legal scrutiny both on a federal and state level, with over 27 states evaluating or imposing new legislation on various e-commerce activities or engaging in lawsuits with e-retailers. In Europe, we must comply with regulations with respect to customs, duties and V.A.T. as they apply to our business, sometimes on a country-by-country basis, which requires complex tracking and remittance processes. 


• | The Communications Decency Act of 1996, which gives statutory protection to online service providers for claims against interactive computer services providers who distribute third-party content.


• | The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, which restricts the distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children and imposes additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect user information from minors. In addition, the Protection of Children From Sexual Predators Act of 1998 requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances. 


• | Data privacy and security with respect to the collection of personally identifiable consumer information continues to be a focus of worldwide legislation and compliance review. Examples include statutes adopted by the State of California that require online services to report certain breaches of the security of personal data, and to report to California customers when their personal data might be disclosed to direct marketers. 


• | Foreign governments are raising similar privacy and data security concerns. In particular, the E.U. has enacted a new General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) that will replace the current Data Protection Directive in May 2018. The GDPR will tighten regulation of the collection, use and security of personal data and will continue to restrict the trans-border flow of such data while increasing the potential fines for non-compliance. Several European countries have issued new guidelines under the E.U. e-Privacy (Cookie) Directive that require robust disclosures and consumer choice before a user can be tracked online. The European Commission has proposed a new e-Privacy Regulation (“e-PR”) that would supersede the existing Directive and is intended to become effective at the same time as the GDPR. If adopted, the new e-PR would require extensive privacy warnings about third party tracking tools and would establish express consent as the only valid basis for third party processing of personal data for advertising or cross-domain analytics. European industry has implemented a self-regulatory regime for online behavioral advertising that is largely consistent with the U.S. self-regulatory framework. It is unclear how compliance with the GDPR will affect our business and it is not possible to predict whether the e-PR will be enacted as proposed. Canada, Australia, Russia, China, Japan and other countries in South/Latin America and Asia are also strengthening their privacy laws and the enforcement of privacy and data security requirements.

We expect and plan for new laws and regulations to be adopted over time that will be directly applicable to the Internet and to our activities. Any existing or new legislation applicable to our business could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations and potential penalties or fees for non-compliance, and could negatively impact the growth in the use of the Internet in general and our services in particular. We may also run the risk of retroactive application of new laws to our business practices that could result in liability or losses. As we continue to expand further into international territories, we expect the above-noted regulatory issues to also apply to such expansion as well as new issues to arise. Although we cannot presently anticipate all of the laws and regulations that might be applicable in new countries that we enter, we expect that legal issues applicable to our business in those countries will continue to arise as we assess and evaluate the scope of our operations in such countries. 
We post on our website our privacy policies and practices concerning the use and disclosure of user data. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, Federal Trade Commission requirements or other privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings by governmental or regulatory bodies that could potentially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In this regard, there are a large number of legislative proposals before the United States Congress and various state legislative bodies regarding privacy issues related to our business. It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted, and certain proposals, if adopted, could harm our business through a decrease in user registrations and revenue. These decreases could be caused by, among other possible provisions, the required use of disclaimers or other requirements before users can utilize our services. 
Due to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to change previous regulatory schemes or choose to regulate its transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws. We might unintentionally violate such laws, such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future. Any such developments could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We may be subject to legal liability for our online services. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the United States and abroad. Due to the nature of our content-rich automated upload service, claims are frequently alleged or asserted against us for trademark and copyright infringement and violation of rights of publicity to which we rapidly and expeditiously respond. We maintain content usage review systems that, through a combination of manual and automated blocks, monitor potentially infringing content of which we become aware. Nevertheless, claims may continue to be brought and threatened against us for negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of information, its origin and its distribution and there is no guarantee that we will be able to resolve any such claims quickly and without damage to us, our business model, our reputation or our operations. 
Raw Materials and Suppliers
We work with a wide range of suppliers that provide raw materials, primarily ink and blank inventory for customization. We have multiple sources for the various types of raw materials and blank inventory used in our business, and are therefore not dependent on a single source. We have historically worked with, and currently expect to continue to work with, two primary suppliers for apparel inventory, Hanesbrands, Inc. and Sun Apparel, but have access to many additional and alternative apparel suppliers. With respect to raw materials used in the printing process, we work with a number of suppliers, primarily digital printing equipment manufacturers, for the inks used in our digital printing processes, and have access to multiple alternate suppliers for ink. We have a three-year term supply agreement with Hanesbrands, Inc. but do not have a long-term supply agreement with Sun Apparel.
We believe the successful management of our supplier relationships is a key aspect of our business. We source our blank products from domestic and foreign manufacturers and distributors. Our current suppliers may not continue to sell merchandise to us on terms acceptable to us, and we may be unable to establish new or extend current supplier relationships to ensure a steady supply of blank inventory in a timely and cost-efficient manner. Under some of our current supply agreements for blank inventory, we enjoy flexible policies for returning the unsold items to our suppliers. If we are unable to accurately predict demand for the products that we are committed to purchase, we will be responsible for covering the cost of the products that we are unable to sell.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 298 full-time employees. Below is a summary of employees by function:

Cost of revenue | 138
Technology and development | 63 
Sales and marketing | 64 
General and administrative | 33 
Total | 298

During the peak holiday season, we hire contract workers on a temporary basis from third-party outsourcing firms. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we used approximately 800 temporary workers to assist in our production and fulfillment operations. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced any employment-related work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
In January of 2018, as part of a cost reduction initiative, we reduced headcount by approximately 5%.
