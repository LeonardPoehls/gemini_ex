ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
 
Rebel Group, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Florida on September 13, 2011. Effective April 16, 2013, the Company changed its name from “First Social Networx Corp.” to “Moxian Group Holdings, Inc.” with “MOXG” as its trading symbol. Also, effective April 16, 2013, the Company increased the number of shares that it is authorized to issue to a total of 600,000,000 shares, including 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.0001 per share. In addition, effective April 16, 2013, the Company effected a 20-for-1 forward stock split of its Common Stock, without changing the par value or the number of authorized shares of the Common Stock (the “Forward Split”).
 
On April 25, 2013, pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement, the Company completed a reverse acquisition of Moxian BVI and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Moxian HK, Moxian Shenzhen and Moxian Malaysia (the “Share Exchange Transaction”). The Company acquired the operating business of Moxian BVI and its subsidiaries and the Company ceased being a shell company as such term is defined under Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. After the incorporation of the business of Moxian BVI, the Company changed its business to developing a social network platform that sought to integrate social media and business into one single platform.
 
On February 17, 2014, the Company incorporated a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Moxian Intellectual Property Limited, under the laws of Samoa (“Moxian Samoa”). On February 19, 2014, Moxian HK and Moxian Shenzhen entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with Moxian Samoa, where Moxian HK and Moxian Shenzhen assigned and transferred all of the intellectual property rights that they respectively owned in connection with the Moxian business (the “IP Rights”) to Moxian Samoa in consideration of $1,000,000. As a result, the Company then owned and controlled such IP Rights through Moxian Samoa.
 
On February 19, 2014, the shareholders then holding a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company approved and authorized the Company to enter into a License and Acquisition Agreement (the “License and Acquisition Agreement”) with MOXC, pursuant to which the Company sold 100% of the equity interests of Moxian BVI together with its subsidiaries to Moxian CN Group Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MOXC (“Moxian CN Samoa”) for $1,000,000. The License and Acquisition Agreement closed on February 21, 2014. As a result, Moxian BVI, together with its subsidiaries, Moxian HK, Moxian Shenzhen, and Moxian Malaysia, became the subsidiaries of MOXC.
 
Under the License and Acquisition Agreement, the Company also agreed to grant MOXC the exclusive right to use the Company’s then held IP Rights in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, and other countries and regions where the Company conduct business (the “Licensed Territory”) as well as the exclusive right to solicit, promote, distribute and sell Moxian products and services in the Licensed Territory for five years (the “License”). In exchange for such License, MOXC agreed to pay to the Company: (i) $1,000,000 as a license maintenance royalty each year commencing on the first anniversary of the date of the License and Acquisition Agreement and (ii) 3% of the gross profit resulting from distribution and sale of our products and services on behalf of the Company as an earned royalty. In addition, MOXC had the right to acquire the new IP Rights that are developed by the Company and sub-license such rights to a third party. MOXC was also under the obligation to develop the social media market of our products and services in the Licensed Territory.
 
The Company sought to acquire a new business in the technology area and as a result, on July 23, 2014, the Company changed its name from “Moxian Group Holdings, Inc.” to “Inception Technology Group, Inc.” Also, effective July 23, 2014, the Company effected a 1-for-5 reverse split of its issued and outstanding Common Stock. However, no acquisition of a technology business was closed or consummated.
 
On December 5, 2014, the Company amended the Articles of Incorporation to change its corporate name from “Inception Technology Group, Inc.” to “Rebel Group, Inc.” and effectuated a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of its Common Stock, without changing the par value or the number of authorized shares of the Common Stock (the “Reverse Split”).

The business plan of the Company was originally to utilize a social network platform that integrated social media and business into one single platform to promote businesses of merchants and assist the targeted clients to find consumers online and bring them into real-world stores. Immediately after the completion of the Share Exchange Transaction and the Equity Transfer Transaction, as such terms are defined below, the Company discontinued its social media business and changed its business to producing dynamic Mixed Martial Arts (“MMA”) fighting events and promoting MMA fighting in China and Singapore.
 
Rebel Holdings Limited, which utilizes the trade name of Rebel Fighting Championship, was incorporated on October 28, 2014 in the British Virgin Islands and engages in the business of hosting and promoting MMA events.
 
Pure Heart was incorporated under the laws of Singapore on August 24, 2000 under the name “Sook Kee Coffeeshop Pte. Ltd.” Effective November 27, 2002, it changed its name to “Asia Pacific Export International Pte Ltd.” It later changed its name from “Asia Pacific Export International Pte Ltd.” to “Pure Heart Entertainment Pte Ltd.” on June 7, 2013. As of October 30, 2014, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Rebel FC. Pure Heart is an operating subsidiary of Rebel FC and is dedicated to hosting and promoting MMA events.
 
SCA Capital Limited, a British Virgin Islands company, was incorporated on January 7, 2011 and holds the intellectual property rights relating to the Rebel FC business. On October 28, 2014, SCA Capital became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rebel FC.
 
Share Exchange Transaction
 
On January 30, 2015, REBL, Rebel FC and the sole stockholder of Rebel FC who owned 100% of Rebel FC (the “Rebel FC Stockholder”) entered into and consummated transactions pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement,” such transaction referred to as the “Share Exchange Transaction”), whereby the Company issued to the Rebel FC Stockholder 20,700,000 shares of its Common Stock, par value $.0001 per share, in exchange for 100% of the equity interests of Rebel FC held by the Rebel FC Stockholder. The shares of our Common Stock received by the Rebel FC Stockholder in the Share Exchange Transaction then constituted approximately 90% of our issued and outstanding Common Stock. As a result of the Share Exchange Transaction, Rebel FC, together with its subsidiaries, Pure Heart and SCA Capital, became REBL’s wholly-owned subsidiaries.
 
The Share Exchange Agreement contained representations and warranties by us, Rebel FC and the Rebel FC Stockholder which are customary for transactions of this type such as, with respect to the Company: organization, good standing and qualification to do business; capitalization; subsidiaries; authorization and validity of the transaction and transaction documents; consents being obtained or not required to consummate the transaction; no conflict or violation of Articles of Incorporation; with respect to Rebel FC: authorization; capitalization; and title to Rebel FC’s ordinary shares being exchanged, and with respect to Rebel FC Stockholder: authorization; no conflict or violation of law; investment purpose; reliance on exemption on the Company’s Common Stock to be exchanged; and transfer or resale pursuant to the Securities Act.
 
Our acquisition of Rebel FC and its subsidiaries pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization effected by a share exchange. Rebel FC was considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes.
 
Equity Transfer Transaction
 
The Transaction
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the Share Exchange Transaction, the Company entered into an Equity Transfer Agreement (the “Equity Transfer Agreement,” such transaction, the “Equity Transfer Transaction”) with MOXC, to sell, transfer, and convey 50,000 ordinary shares of Moxian IP, constituting 100% equity interests of Moxian IP for $6,782,000 (the “Moxian IP Transfer Price”). The Moxian IP Transfer Price for Moxian IP is based on an appraisal report, dated November 15, 2014, prepared by Grant Sherman Appraisal Limited, an independent appraiser.

Termination of the License and Acquisition Agreement
 
As set forth above, on February 19, 2014, the Company and MOXC entered into a License and Acquisition Agreement, where the Company granted to MOXC the exclusive right to use the intellectual property rights owned by Moxian IP and in consideration of such license, MOXC agreed to pay (i) $1,000,000 as license maintenance royalty each year commencing on the first anniversary of the date of the License Agreement; and (ii) 3% of the gross profits resulting from the distribution and sale of the products and services on behalf of the Company as an earned royalty. Pursuant to the License and Acquisition Agreement, the Company also agreed to sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver all of the equity interests of Moxian Group Limited, a corporation incorporated under the laws of British Virgin Islands to Moxian CN SAMOA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MOXC, for the consideration of $1,000,000 (such transaction, the “Sale of Moxian BVI,” and the purchase price, the “Moxian BVI Transfer Price”). Immediately prior to the execution of the Equity Transfer Agreement, the Moxian BVI Transfer Price was not paid and no license maintenance royalty or earned royalty under the License and Acquisition Agreement had accrued.
 
Therefore, under the Equity Transfer Agreement, the Company and MOXC agreed to terminate the License and Acquisition Agreement so that the liabilities of MOXC and the rights of the Company thereunder, other than the Moxian BVI Transfer Price, were terminated.
 
Pursuant to the Equity Transfer Agreement, MOXC agreed to repay the Moxian IP Transfer Price and the Moxian BVI Transfer Price in the aggregate of $7,782,000 in the form of a convertible promissory note (the “Note”) issued by MOXC. The maturity date for the Note was October 30, 2015 with 1% interest per annum, and all sums due under this Note could be converted at the conversion price of $1.00 per share (“Conversion Price”) at the option of MOXC, if the volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of MOXC’s common stock for a period of thirty (30) trading days immediately prior to the date of conversion was higher than the Conversion Price. Under the Note, MOXC had a right of first refusal to purchase the shares issuable upon conversion at the price of 80% of the VWAP for 30 trading days immediately prior to the date of the proposed repurchase by MOXC.
 
On August 14, 2015, due to the VWAP of the MOXC Common Stock for 30 trading day prior to August 14, 2015 was higher than $1.00, which triggered the clause of conversion under the MOXC Note, MOXC notified us that it elected to convert the amount of $3,891,000 under the MOXC Note into 3,891,000 shares of the MOXC Common Stock at the conversion price of $1.00 (the “August Conversion”). As a result of the August Conversion, the remainder amount of the MOXC Note was $3,891,000.
 
On September 30, 2015, MOXC notified us that it elected to convert the remainder of the MOXC Note, of $3,891,000 into 3,891,000 shares of the MOXC Common Stock (the “September Conversion”). After the August Conversion and the September Conversion, consequently, all of the MOXC Note was converted in to the total of 7,782,000 shares of the MOXC Common Stock with no amount of the MOXC Note outstanding.  On May 24, 2016, MOXC’s Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split of MOXC’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, at a ratio of 1-for-2 (the “MOXC Reverse Stock Split”). The MOXC Reverse Stock Split was effective on June 20, 2016, and pursuant to the MOXC Reverse Stock Split, the Company’s shares in MOXC were reduced from 7,782,000 shares to 3,891,000 shares.
 
Plan and Completion of Disposition
 
On January 30, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved and submitted for approval of the Company’s shareholders with a majority of voting rights, a Plan of Disposition (“Plan of Disposition”). Under the Plan of Disposition, the Company proposed to distribute the proceeds resulting from the Equity Transfer Transaction and Sale of Moxian BVI, within one year from the date of the Equity Transfer Transaction, to the shareholders as of January 29, 2015, on a pro-rata basis except for Rebel FC Stockholder, who agreed to waive such proceeds. On January 30, 2015, the Company’s shareholders with a majority of voting rights approved the Plan of Disposition. No additional vote of the Company’s shareholders was required or sought in connection with the Plan of Disposition, and the Company’s record shareholders had no appraisal rights in connection with the proposed transactions under the Plan of Disposition.  The Plan of Disposition was not completed within the planned one year period, and was delayed due to MOXC’s then proposed underwritten offering and exchange listing. On May 24, 2016, due to the MOXC Reverse Stock Split, effective on June 20, 2016, the Company’s shares in MOXC were reduced from 7,782,000 shares to 3,891,000 shares. The Company is in the process of preparing and approving a revised Plan of Disposition, which takes into account that the Company currently holds 3,891,000 shares of MOXC which are currently valued at $11,283,900 and pursuant to which the Company plans to distribute, as a dividend, the 3,891,000 MOXC shares to the Company’s shareholders as of January 29, 2015, on a pro-rata basis, that would have been entitled to share in the proceeds of the sale of the MOXC shares by the Company under the original Plan of Disposition, if the Company had consummated such sale. The common stock of MOXC is currently quoted on the Nasdaq under the symbol MOXC at a price of $2.90 per share as of April 3, 2017.

On January 30, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Rebel FC pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement. The acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization effected by a Share Exchange Transaction. Rebel FC was considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes.
 
Also on January 30, 2015, we transferred 100% equity interests of Moxian IP to MOXC pursuant to the Equity Transfer Agreement. As a result of the Equity Transfer Transaction, Moxian IP ceased to be our subsidiary, and the Company changed its business from licensing intellectual property rights relating to a social network to organizing and promoting MMA fighting events in Asia.
 
Recent Developments
 
Pure Heart and Qingdao Leibo Sports Culture Co. Ltd (“QLSC”) entered into an MMA Events Cooperation Agreement on May 1, 2016 (the “2016 Cooperation Agreement”). Qingdao Quanyao Sports Consulting Co.

The following diagram sets forth the structure of the Company as of the date of this Report:
 


Our website address is http://www.rebelfightingchampionship.com/en/.  Information contained on our web site is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 
Overview of Our Business
 
Rebel FC through its subsidiary Pure Heart organizes promotes and hosts MMA events featuring top level athletic talent. With assistance from contracted production crews, Rebel FC also produces and distributes, through the internet and social media, and sells the rights to distribute to television stations, videos of its MMA events. Prior to incorporation of Rebel FC, its business was mainly conducted through its current operating subsidiary, Pure Heart Entertainment Pte. Ltd.
 
Rebel FC seeks to promote MMA in Asian countries through hosting events that attract talented fighters from all over the world. MMA is unarmed combat involving the use of a combination of techniques from different disciplines of martial arts, including, without limitation, grappling, submission holds, kicking and striking. The styles of martial arts range from Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Judo, Karate, Boxing, Muay Thai, Wrestling, Jeet Kune Do, Taekwondo, Sanshou and various other forms of martial arts. Unlike boxing, where athletes can only strike with their fists and only above the belt, the fighters in MMA can use punches, kicks, elbows, knee strikes, takedowns and submissions to win a contest.
 
Production of Rebel FC MMA events usually involves obtaining sponsorships, signing up fighters, securing event venues, setting up event venues, marketing its events and producing event videos. Rebel FC’s events are broadcast through television, internet and other means of social media such as Facebook and Twitter. There are also pre-event shows at its live events, which include music performances and fighters’ interviews and documentaries. Rebel FC is dedicated to producing high quality shows throughout Singapore, and it also has held MMA events in China. Rebel FC plans to broadcast their MMA events through top sporting entertainment stations in each country, while also focusing on utilizing online platforms for internet streaming in order to reach audiences in other countries.
 
In addition to television broadcasting, Rebel FC plans to attract pay-per-view (“PPV”) audiences. Rebel FC believes that the PPV model can be deployed in China in 2018 with support from selected service providers to enable paid online streaming of Rebel FC’s MMA events.

Our Events
 
The Company hosts live events in which highly skilled fighters from different martial arts backgrounds compete at different weight classes. We also integrate the introduction of background information and stories of the athletes into the broadcasting of fighting events.
 
The Company selects fighters with a distinguished career for a planned event. After a careful selection process, we market our MMA events by posting on social media or broadcasting through TV channels, video journals and interviews of the fighters.
 
In 2013 and 2014, Rebel FC successfully hosted two events in Singapore. Rebel FC’s first event, Into the Lion’s Den, was hosted on December 21, 2013 at the Singapore Indoor Stadium and approximately 3,400 people attended the event. Into the Lion’s Den brought a mix of both amateur and professional MMA match-ups to its audience, featuring eleven fights between various international fighters such as Syafiq, one of the first Singaporeans to win a gold medal in the IFMA Asian Muay Thai championship, and Gyo Pyung Hwang, a renowned fighter from Korea. The main event on that day was between Rob Lisita against Lion Takeshi.
 
The second event, Battle Royale, was held on August 1, 2014 at the Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre and approximately 4,800 fans attended. Battle Royale was an 8-man “knock out” tournament. The aim of the event was to test the skills of eight participants of the tournament. Leading up to the fights were 30-minute documentaries on the individual fighters which were broadcast on www.supersport.com/live-video.
 
The tournament structure for Battle Royale began with the 8 men competing in 4 quarter-final fights. The 4 winners of the quarter-final fights will compete against each other in the semi-finals contest and final contest to be held in the upcoming events in China. In the future events to be held in China, there will be one champion from the final contest. Among the 8 participants in Battle Royale, two were considered the best all-time bantamweight MMA athletes, including Miguel Torres from the U.S. and his equally formidable countryman Will Chope, former Ultimate Fighting Championship (“UFC”) fighter and former Universal Reality Combat Championship (“URCC”) champion. Competing the line-up were Yojiro Uchimura from Japan, the current URCC champion and Reydon Romero from the Philippines, Australian submission specialist Michael Tobin, hard brawling Australian Thai Pat Promrangka, Brazilian Watch Out Combat Show (“WOCS”) champion Mauricio “Faccao” Dos Santos Jr, and Takahiro Ashida, a Japanese champion of DEEP, an MMA organization.
 
The two events were broadcast via television as pre-recorded events. In addition, highlights and online rebroadcasts of these two events were also available free of charge, ensuring that Rebel FC’s events would have sufficient publicity among potential audiences. We also leveraged media exposure for sponsorships, advertising deals and contracts with televisions to broadcast our events.
 
On October 20, 2015, the Company planned to hold an event at the MasterCard Center in Beijing titled the Battle Royale Ascension together with Qingdao Quanyao Sports Consulting Co. Ltd, a Chinese entity incorporated in Qingdao, China. This event was cancelled due to QQSC’s inability to obtain required approval from local authorities in time for QQSC to get sufficient advertising, sponsorship and ticket sales for the planned event. The Company received USD $200,000 from QQSC in connection with the event, such fees were used by the Company to pay its operating expenses.
 
On June 27, 2015, the Company held an event titled the Promised Ones at the Qingdao Sports Centre together with QQSC. QQSC paid Pure Heart USD $350,000 for this event. Such fees were used by the Company to pay its operating expenses. Further for this event, QQSC paid Pure Heart an additional $100,000 on top of the $250,000 required under the 2015 Cooperation Agreement due to difficulties incurred by Pure Hear in its efforts in organizing the event.
 
On June 25, 2016, the Company held an event titled Battle Royale Ascension at the Qingdao Sports Centre together with QLSC. QLSC has paid Pure Heart USD $200,000 for this event. QLSC still owes USD $50,000 to Pure Heart for this event which it anticipates collecting

Rules of MMA
 
There is no official or non-official organization or association governing the MMA industry. However, different promoters have agreed that their MMA fighting events would abide by the Unified Rules of MMA, adopted by all state athletic commissions in the United States as well as many other promoting organizations under various jurisdictions worldwide. These rules are available at: http://www.elitemmareferees.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=50&Itemid=63.
 
One of the basic rules of MMA is that fighters shall not fight against another fighter of a different weight class. Another rule is that fights should be held in a ring or in a fenced area. Such ring or fenced area has to meet specific requirements.
 
Rebel FC’s events follow the Unified Rules of MMA.
 
Fighters
 
An important element to a successful MMA event is to identify and retain suitable fighters. Prior to organizing our events, we usually reach out to managers of fighters in the MMA industry in search of suitable fighters for our upcoming events. Our Chief Talent Officer then negotiates and enters into our standard contracts with fighters. Fighters, in addition to combatting in our events, are also required to participate in our press conferences, interviews and documentaries and, from time to time, to appear on our sponsors’ commercials. In order to attract fans and media from both international and local markets, we specifically select fighters with distinguished careers, memorable personalities, and exciting fighting styles.
Development Plan
 
The Company seeks to penetrate further into China markets in 2017. We plan to enter into contracts with free-to-air and cable channels, pay-per-view channels and sports-oriented channels in China. We hope to acquire sponsorships to promote our events in China. We also plan to establish a fan club online to create brand loyalty for Rebel’s future events. Additionally, The Company plans to broadcast an episodic reality show aimed towards mainstream Chinese TV, which it hopes to launch in 2018.
 
The Company plans to hold five events in 2017 with two in Shanghai and three in Shenzhen. However there can be no assurance that such events will occur, or even if they do occur there can be no guarantee that such events will be successful or profitable.
 
The Company requires roughly between $2 million and $5 million in capital in order to support its business plan. The Company is seeking to raise capital for the necessary funds. However, there can be no assurance that such capital can be raised, and even it if can be raised that it will be on terms acceptable to the Company and its shareholders. If the Company cannot raise such required funds, it may have to limit or cease its operations.
 
Planned Activities
 
REBEL Reality Show
 
If the Company is able to raise sufficient funds, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017, we plan to unveil a new addition to our televised content by expanding the REBEL brand beyond the traditional sports market and into mainstream television through 12 episodes of a Reality TV series we hope can be aired across major Chinese networks. We hope that this show will serve to cross over to mainstream fans by linking stars built over the course of a season of Reality TV to REBEL FC live events, effectively introducing a much larger audience to our core product. We hope that the show will also serve the purpose of continuing the brand narrative, increasing awareness for live events, educating the average viewer on the dynamics and intrigue of Mixed Martial Arts, and serving as a platform to market company merchandise to a wide audience.

REBEL Products
 
We also plan to seek to expand related profit across a variety of alternative markets, including but not limited to retail products such as: Energy Drinks, Brand Gym, Videogames, and Clothing Lines. The Company anticipates distributing these planned products through our online platform as well as through gyms. However there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to develop such products nor distribute them, or even if it does, that such products would be successful of profitable.
 
Revenues
 
Currently, the Rebel FC’s revenues come from the following sources:
 
Ticket Sales
 
Rebel FC hosts live MMA fighting events in stadiums and sells tickets to audiences that attend the live events. Tickets are priced at different levels, ranging from $58 to $388, based on seating locations and availability of complimentary services, such as complimentary drinks and food, free t-shirts, etc. We also plan to sell some of our branded products, such as gloves, T-shirt, to our audience at the live events. We sold 3,400 tickets at our first event, Into the Lion’s Den for a total of $342,000 in ticket sales. A total of 4,800 tickets were sold at our second event, Battle Royal, resulting in a total of $388,000 in ticket sales.
 
On June 27, 2015, the Company held an event title the Promised Ones at the Qingdao Sports Centre together with QQSC. Pure Heart was not responsible for ticket sales with regard to this event and neither Pure Heart nor the Company received any share of profits or losses for this event.
 
On June 25, 2016, the Company held an event titled Battle Royale Ascension at the Qingdao Sports Centre together with QLSC. Pure Heart was not responsible for ticket sales with regard to this event and neither Pure Heart nor the Company received any share of profits or losses for this event, and instead, QLSC has paid Pure Heart USD $200,000 for this event and the Company has used such fees to pay its operating expenses. QLSC still owes $50,000 to Pure Heart for this event, which it anticipates collecting.
 
Central to the success of the Rebel FC live events is our ability to sell tickets in the most efficient and effective method possible. Due to the nature of the international combat sports market and the events production market in general, we rely on a variety of ticketing agents to assist us in distributing tickets through their extensive personal databases. These agents will vary depending on the chosen event venue and other pre-event stipulations. Through the combination of reliable agents and our own streamlined marketing systems we believe it will be possible to maintain a successful online ticket distribution presence for each live event in Singapore and China.
 
The Company plans to hold five events in 2017 in China, with two in Shanghai and three in Shenzhen. The Company plans to charge between RMB 180 to 3,888 (US $26.14 to US $564.54) for tickets to these planned events, with the final price to be determined based on the location of the event. However, there can be no assurance that such events will occur, or even if they do occur there can be no guarantee that such events will be successful or profitable.
 
Sponsorship
 
Sponsorship to our events is in forms of cash, provision of event venues, equipment and marketing campaign services. Our business model is to obtain sponsorships that are sufficient to cover the costs of hosting an event prior to incurring substantial costs for organizing an event. For its first two events, Rebel FC obtained sponsorships from 13 sponsors in various industries, such as HTC, a cell phone designer and manufacturer and True Fitness, a chain of gyms located in Singapore. Rebel FC believes it can obtain more sponsorship opportunities from various sports related brands and events companies. In consideration of the provided sponsorship, our sponsors have exposure in our promotional campaigns in connection with our events, including printing sponsors’ names and logos on banners and posters at our events, offering sponsors’ products to the audience at our events, allowing sponsors’ advertisements on our pre-event shows, on our social media pages as well as our website and allowing fighters to feature in sponsors’ commercials. We work with the sponsors to customize the promotional methods to achieve the sponsors’ marketing goals. For each event, we target to obtain at least 10 sponsors. We are also seeking to obtain sponsors for our planned reality show.

TV Distribution
 
Rebel FC plans to hire staff and personnel in the future with the ability to create and produce its live events and sell the rights to broadcast its events to television stations in Singapore and China. We intend to distribute our event programs internationally through television distribution agents in the future for a more stable stream of income. In addition to the broadcast of our live shows and other aired pre-fight footage, we will also look to secure broadcasting rights for other viable related programming such as the Rebel FC Reality TV Show that we hope will appeal to a larger fan base and can be used to integrate new fans into our live product.
 
Pay-Per-View
 
Pay-per-view (“PPV”) is a type of pay television and online service by which a subscriber can purchase events to view via private telecast or online. The PPV model is a model whereby we can broadcast live events on cooperating television stations. Audiences can pay to watch the live events on their televisions or laptops instead of going to a stadium. In China or South East Asia, PPV is relatively new and still in development, but we believe the success of PPV model in the U.S. can be achieved in Asia as well. Rebel FC plans to implement the PPV model for its live MMA events in 2018. We plan to charge $8 to $30 for each PPV event that the audience watches through PPV in China.
 
MMA Event Expenses
 
The promotion and organization of MMA events require various types of expenses, a majority of which consist of online and television advertising fees and payments to fighters. Another significant cost is venue rental fee. Other expenses and costs incurred in connection with our events include equipment rentals, and staff compensation.
Audience
 
From the survey we did in the past two events we held in Singapore and our first event in China, a majority of the audiences were male with ages ranging from 18 to 35. Thus, this group is our targeted audience. We also have targeted marketing and sales for our events to college graduates who had watched sports television programs in the past 12 months and/or had participated in sports-oriented activities in the past 12 months. The secondary target would consist of males between 35 – 45 years old and females between 18-34 years old. The gender mix would be 70% male and 30% female. United States Sports Marketing Research firm, Scarborough Sports marketing has researched that this target audience has substantial purchasing power with sound financials.
 
We believe that our targeted audience appeals to a wide array of advertising and sponsorship verticals (automotive, food and beverage, sports products, consumer electronics, consumer products), therefore enabling advertisers and sponsors to establish brand awareness and loyalty through our events.

Marketing Strategy
 
Marketing is essential to Rebel FC’s operations and business. Brand awareness and engagement of our fans and general audience are key considerations in our marketing strategy. We utilize the following marketing and PR activities to reach out to our target audience and the mass media, including open workouts, road shows, weigh-ins and press-conferences. We also advertise our events on billboards, banners, television ads, bus stop advertisements and online advertisements. Rebel FC also has a public relations department, which is dedicated to contacting television media and other news agencies, hosting press conferences and ensuring sufficient publicity of our events in social media and other traditional media. We also plan to seek out and engage a reputable public relations firm in China to help assist us with our advertising.
 
With a focus on customer awareness and creative branding, Rebel FC seeks to use social media to develop intensive marketing campaigns designed to attract both seasoned and new fans of combat sports. Rebel FC’s marketing strategy aims to drive traffic and audience growth through working with social media, public relations firms, strategic partnerships with television stations and sponsors, and advertising agencies. For instance, we held press conferences for MMA fans and the media to attend at all our events. We also plan to work with gyms and fighting associations to promote our brand to their members and attract members to attend our events.
 
We believe that Rebel FC is distinguished from other MMA promotion companies in a way that we promote our events and fighters with vivid life stories of fighters, which highlight their passion for MMA. We believe that the behind-the-scene stories may attract audiences by showing how fighters grow their strength and brevity for the sports. Prior to a live event, we arrange face-to-face interactive sessions between fighters and audiences who are fans and supporters of these fighters. We believe this promotional method may allow us to communicate with the audiences and attract their attention to Rebel FC and eventually stimulate their desire to watch our events live or on other available media. During the events, we also broadcast the stories of athletes to provide deeper understanding of our audience about the fighters’ lives.
 
Although Mixed Martial Arts is still a growing industry, we believe our brand differentiates itself from other international combat sports organizations by combining entertainment and narrative to create an experience that we believe goes beyond the traditional sports experience. Using local athletes on dynamic televised live events until the public is acquainted with their personality, style, and back-story, we expect our fighters to become recognizable, not only inside the ring, but also outside it, serving as brand ambassadors for Rebel FC, our sponsors, and presenting a positive image of mixed martial arts to our fan-base and mainstream audiences.
 
Market Opportunities
 
According to IBIS World’s Martial Arts Studios market research report, the total market size is $3 billion for mixed martial arts revenue worldwide. From 2014 to 2019, the industry is expected to grow at an even faster rate. (http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/martial-arts-studios.html). A robust economic recovery is expected to endow consumers with higher disposable income levels, enabling them to spend more money on martial arts instruction, particularly costly private lessons. Additionally, the increase of popularity of mixed martial arts will continue to drive demand for the industry.
 
There are regular MMA events hosted in the Asia Pacific region by established fight promoters. Despite being a relatively new promoter, Rebel FC sees the opportunity for the growth of MMA in the Asian sports market, especially the untapped market in China. China has been reported to be a potentially significant market for the MMA industry (http://www.businessinsider.com/mixed-martial-arts-is-becoming-popular-in-rural-china-and-ufc-is-looking-to-capitalize-2014-8). According to the Mailman Group in China, MMA has the largest number of references on Chinese social media, outnumbering other traditional sports, such as basket balls and footballs. As shown in the below chart, MMA has drawn a lot of public attention in Chinese social media.

Rebel FC believes that, with its experience in Singapore, it is in a good position to re-create its success of producing and promoting MMA events in China.
 
In addition, with the growing use of PPV in China, online video streaming sites such as Baidu and Tencent have millions of users using their App for streaming of shows. Rebel FC plans to coordinate with a streaming platform to market our shows, making our events available to a large population in China (http://www.boxinginsider.com/headlines/chinese-pay-per-view-could-open-up-new-vistas-with-pacquiao-bout/”).
 
Competition
 
The main players in the MMA industry include: i) Ultimate Fighting Championship (“UFC”), which has its focus on the U.S. market, ii) ONE Fighting Championship (“OFC”), which is based in Singapore and targets the Asia market and iii) Kunlun Fight, a fighting club located in China which broadcasts its events over the Chinese television channels. Despite the fact that our competitors are well established and have more funds available for marketing and producing their events than us, and are more reputable among the audiences in MMA, we are concentrating on the untapped combat sports market of China where we believe we have the resource and experience to penetrate the market and grow our business there. We seek to engage high quality producers to produce quality videos of our events. These produced videos are planned to be broadcasted on the internet and be shared on the social media. We believe this will allow us to expand our market shares in existing social media mediums. During the fights, we plan to have our audience to engage during the fights with our commentators through social media. This interactive method has been used by other sports media and is assisting brands to gain a traction and proven growth record of new likes and awareness.
Employees
 
We maintain a specialized and experienced team consisting of 9 full time members who are capable of leading temporary out-sourced personnel on a per event basis. We also have contract personnel for our television and live event productions.
