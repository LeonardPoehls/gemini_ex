ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
Liberty Property Trust (the "Trust") is a self-administered and self-managed Maryland real estate investment trust (a "REIT"). Substantially all of the Trust's assets are owned directly or indirectly, and substantially all of the Trust's operations are conducted directly or indirectly, by its subsidiary, Liberty Property Limited Partnership, a Pennsylvania limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership" and, together with the Trust and their consolidated subsidiaries, the "Company").
The Company completed its initial public offering in 1994 to continue and expand the commercial real estate business of Rouse & Associates, a Pennsylvania general partnership, and certain affiliated entities (collectively, the "Predecessor"), which was founded in 1972. As of December 31, 2016, the Company owned and operated 450 industrial and 55 office properties (the "Wholly Owned Properties in Operation") totaling 86.0 million square feet. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, the Company owned 25 properties under development, which when completed are expected to comprise 5.6 million square feet (the "Wholly Owned Properties under Development") and 1,643 acres of developable land, substantially all of which is zoned for commercial use. Additionally, as of December 31, 2016, the Company had an ownership interest, through unconsolidated joint ventures, in 49 industrial and 14 office properties totaling 13.1 million square feet (the "JV Properties in Operation" and, together with the Wholly Owned Properties in Operation, the "Properties in Operation"), two properties under development, which when completed are expected to comprise 1.6 million square feet and a 222-room Four Seasons Hotel (the "JV Properties under Development" and, collectively with the Wholly Owned Properties under Development, the "Properties under Development" and, collectively with the Properties in Operation, the "Properties"), and 360 acres of developable land, substantially all of which is zoned for commercial use.
The Company provides leasing, property management, development and other tenant-related services for the Properties. The industrial Properties consist of a variety of warehouse, distribution, service, assembly, light manufacturing and research and development facilities. They include both single-tenant and multi-tenant facilities, with most designed flexibly to accommodate various types of tenants, space requirements and industrial uses. The Company's office Properties consist of metro-office buildings and multi-story and single-story office buildings located principally in suburban mixed-use developments or office parks. Substantially all of the Properties are located in prime business locations within established business communities. The Company’s strategy with respect to product and market selection generally favors industrial properties nationally and metro-office properties in markets with strong demographic and employment trends as well as certain urban characteristics such as population density and transportation access. Additionally, from time to time, the Company develops properties on a fee basis for unrelated third parties or joint ventures in which the Company holds an interest. In these cases the Company typically agrees to be responsible for all aspects of the development of the project and to guarantee the timely lien-free completion of construction of the project and the payment of certain cost overruns incurred in the development of the project.
The Trust is the sole general partner and also a limited partner of the Operating Partnership, owning 97.7% of the common equity of the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2016. The common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership (the "Common Units"), other than those owned by the Trust, are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis (subject to anti-dilution protections) for the Trust's common shares of beneficial interest, $0.001 par value per share (the "Common Shares"). As of December 31, 2016, the Common Units held by the limited partners were exchangeable for 3.5 million Common Shares. The ownership of the holders of Common Units is reflected on the Trust's financial statements as “noncontrolling interest- operating partnership” as a component of total equity. The ownership of the holders of Common Units not owned by the Trust is reflected on the Operating Partnership's financial statements as “limited partners' equity” as a component of total owners' equity.

Wholly Owned Properties
Development
The Company's development investment strategy focuses primarily on the development of high-quality industrial and office properties within its existing markets. When the Company's marketing efforts identify opportunities, the Company will consider pursuing such opportunities outside of the Company's established markets. The Company and its Predecessor have developed over 82 million square feet of commercial real estate during the past 44 years. The Company's development activities generally fall into two categories: build-to-suit projects and projects built for inventory (projects that are less than 75% leased prior to commencement of construction). The Company develops build-to-suit projects for existing and new tenants. The Company also

builds properties for inventory where the Company has identified sufficient demand at market rental rates to justify such construction. 
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company brought into service seven build-to-suit projects and 11 inventory projects totaling 5.7 million square feet and representing an aggregate Total Investment of $518.3 million. As of December 31, 2016, these completed development properties were 93.4% leased.

Substantially all of the land is located adjacent to or within existing industrial or business parks with site improvements, such as public sewers, water and utilities, available for service.

In addition, due to adverse conditions in the Northern Virginia office market, the fair value of six properties owned by Liberty Washington, LP (an unconsolidated joint venture in which the Company holds a 25% interest) containing 698,000 square feet was determined to be less than the debt encumbering the properties. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2016, the joint venture cooperated with the mortgage lenders in the transfer of the six properties to the lenders in satisfaction of an aggregate of $112.5 million in nonrecourse mortgage debt. The book values of these properties had been written down to fair value in a prior period.
