ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
We are a medical technology company primarily focused on the design, development and commercialization of innovative medical devices that can be used for the treatment of obesity.
We are one of the market share leaders in less invasive devices that treat obesity. Our products are used by general surgeons, bariatric surgeons and gastroenterologists in a variety of settings to provide interventional therapy to patients who suffer from obesity and the many co-morbidities associated with obesity.
We believe that obesity is a chronic disease and that the optimal clinical outcome for a substantial portion of patients suffering from obesity will require interventional treatments combined with ongoing, long-term physician care. As a result, our product portfolio consists of surgical and non-surgical interventional devices that fill the gap between low efficacy pharmacological treatments for obesity and highly-invasive, anatomy-altering bariatric stapling procedures. Some of our products are also used in procedures that address or repair a variety of gastrointestinal ("GI") defects.
Our strategic focus and the majority of our future revenue growth is expected to come from our Endo-bariatric product portfolio, which consists of the Orbera® and OverStitchTM systems. Until recently, the majority of our product revenues has come from the Apollo Surgical product portfolio, which consists of the Lap-Band® System and related laparoscopic accessories. Revenues from the Surgical product portfolio had been decreasing over the past several years prior to our acquisition of those products in December 2013 and revenues have continued to decline since. In 2017, Endo-bariatric product sales, in total, surpassed Surgical product sales.
Corporate Background
Apollo was founded in 2005, and is currently incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in Austin, Texas. The Company was founded to develop and commercialize innovations originating from a collaboration of physicians from the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins University, Medical University of South Carolina, the University of Texas Medical Branch and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who called themselves the Apollo Group. The work of the Apollo Group resulted in a significant portfolio of patents in the field of flexible endoscopy and minimally invasive surgery aimed at minimizing the trauma of surgical access by taking advantage of natural orifices to deliver surgical tools to targeted areas.
In December 2013, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the obesity intervention division of Allergan, Inc. In conjunction with this purchase agreement, we entered into several agreements whereby Allergan agreed to provide manufacturing and distribution support over a two year period as we established our own manufacturing and worldwide distribution capabilities. Significant milestones during the transition period include:

• | transfer of U.S. sales force in December 2013, and distribution in September 2014;


• | transfer of Europe, Canada and Australia sales force and distribution in November 2014, and Brazil in November 2015; and


• | start of Costa Rica manufacturing operations in June 2016.

As a result of these transition activities, we established offices in England, Australia, Italy and Brazil that oversee regional sales and distribution activities outside the United States; a manufacturing facility in Costa Rica; and a device analysis lab in California. All other activities are managed and operated from our facilities in Austin, Texas.
In December 2016, we completed a business combination with Lpath, Inc. ("Lpath"), a publicly traded company, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the "Merger Agreement"), dated September 8, 2016 (the "Merger"). Following the Merger, Lpath was renamed "Apollo Endosurgery, Inc." and our common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol "APEN."

Overview of Obesity and the Market
Obesity as a disease is increasing worldwide. In the U.S., it is estimated that 56 million adults are obese or clinically obese with a body mass index (“BMI”) of between 30 and 40. It is further estimated that an additional 12.7 million adults are morbidly obese in the U.S., with a BMI greater than 40. Over 600 million people around the world are considered obese.
According to the Center for Disease Control, there are more than 20 obesity-linked diseases and disorders - known as comorbidities (heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and more). Due to these comorbidities, obesity also adds significant cost to healthcare systems around the world. In the U.S., it has been reported that the cost of providing healthcare to a person with a BMI of 40 is up to two times the cost of providing the same level of healthcare to a person with a BMI less than 30.
Traditional obesity intervention has been bariatric surgery (gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding), which is mostly performed laparoscopically. Today, based on U.S. population demographics and reported bariatric procedure volumes, less than 2% of the population eligible for bariatric surgery have a procedure. We believe that the primary detractor from bariatric surgery is patient fear; fear of surgery in general, but more specifically fear associated with the highly-invasive nature of bariatric surgery, permanent anatomical alteration, potential for non-permanent results and the post-operative severe complications that can be associated with bariatric surgery.    
Apollo's Strategy
Our objective is to improve today's obesity-related health problem by facilitating anatomy preserving, less invasive, yet effective, and reversible interventional procedures for obesity through our product offerings. Our "Endo-bariatric" products treat obesity with procedures delivered with a flexible endoscope and without traditional surgery. We also offer surgical products, consisting of the Lap-Band and related accessory products that offer long-term weight loss and improvement of comorbid conditions through a less-invasive, reversible procedure known as laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ("Gastric Banding").
Our goal is to be a global leader in providing clinically proven, anatomy preserving and less invasive solutions for cost-effective treatment of obese patients. The key elements of our strategy include:

• | Support the adoption of our Endo-bariatric products -We intend to continue to conduct medical education activities along with patient education and outreach initiatives. We will continue to provide field sales support and to make selective investments in reimbursement initiatives to support adoption and use of our Endo-bariatric products.


• | Continue to deliver innovative products and broaden the product portfolio -We intend to broaden our portfolio of products through internal product development efforts, and will consider acquisitions of products or companies that complement our current business.


• | Expand into new markets -We intend to continue to pursue regulatory clearance for our products and improved distribution in key international markets where we believe there is or will be strong market demand for our products.


• | Stabilize the sales of our Surgical products -We intend to continue to service and support our network of surgeon customers who continue to achieve positive outcomes with the Lap-Band and remain dedicated to its use.

Apollo Products
Endo-bariatrics
The Apollo Endo-bariatric products consist primarily of the Orbera Intragastric Balloon System and the OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 54% of the Endo-bariatric product sales related to Orbera and 46% of our Endo-bariatric product sales related to OverStitch, compared to 71% and 29%, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2016.
Orbera Intragastric Balloon System
The Orbera Intragastric Balloon System (the "Orbera System" or "Orbera") and the Orbera365 Managed Weight Loss System ("Orbera365") are non-surgical alternatives for the treatment of overweight and obese adults. The Orbera System and the Orbera365 each include a single silicone balloon that is filled with saline after endoscopic transoral placement into the patient's stomach. Once in the patient's stomach, the balloon serves to reduce stomach capacity, causing patients to consume less following the procedure, and delay gastric emptying, the primary mechanisms of action in assisting the patient in losing weight. Placement of the balloon is temporary and is removed endoscopically, typically, under conscious sedation. 
In the U.S. Orbera is indicated for an indwell period of up to six months for adults within a BMI range of 30 to 40 who have tried other weight loss programs, such as supervised diet and exercise, but who were unable to lose weight and keep it off. Outside the U.S., Orbera is generally indicated for temporary weight loss for patients with a BMI greater than or equal to 27. Orbera is also known in certain markets as BIB (BioEnterics Intragastric Balloon) and BIB is indicated for an indwell period of up to six months for weight loss in obese patients with BMI of 30-39 and also for pre-surgical temporary use in severely obese patients (BMI greater than 40 or a BMI of 35 or greater with comorbidities) in order to reduce surgical risk or for severely obese patients who are not considered as candidates for obesity surgery. Orbera365 is indicated as a weight loss aid with an indwell period of up to twelve months for 1) adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 27 to 50kg/m2 who failed to achieve and maintain weight loss with a supervised weight-control program or 2) adults with a BMI greater than 40 kg/m2 or BMI of 35 kg/m2 with comorbidities, prior to obesity or other surgery, in order to reduce surgical risk. The Orbera365 is currently marketed in the European Union and European Economic Area member countries.
The clinical effectiveness and safety profile of the Orbera System as a non-ulcerogenic weight loss device has been reported in over 230 peer reviewed publications covering over 8,000 patients. Although not specifically indicated for the treatment of obesity-related comorbidities, studies have reported resolution or improvement in a patient's pre-existing comorbidities at the time of Orbera removal. The Orbera is currently the only balloon or other endoscopic product that has been recognized in the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ("ASGE") Preservation and Incorporation of Valuable Endoscopic Innovations assessment to have met its threshold standards for the treatment of obesity. The meta-analysis performed by the ASGE was based on the aggregation of certain clinical studies conducted outside the U.S. and reported an estimated TBWL at six months of approximately 13.2%.
The Orbera System was originally CE marked in May 1997. Orbera365 was CE marked in August 2017 with commercial sales beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017. Orbera365 will replace Orbera in Europe in the next couple of years as Orbera is phased out. Orbera is the global market leader among intragastric balloons available in over 70 countries with more than 277,000 units distributed in the period from January 1, 2006 to March 31, 2017.
Following FDA approval in August 2015, the Orbera System was launched, and we began distribution in the U.S. From FDA approval through the end of 2017, we trained nearly 1,000 U.S. physicians on the use of Orbera for non-surgical less-invasive weight loss for patients who suffer from obesity.
As part of the FDA approval of Orbera in the U.S., we are required to conduct a post-approval clinical study. The Orbera Post-Approval Study is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, post-approval study of the safety and effectiveness of Orbera as an adjunct to weight reduction for obese adults (22 years of age and older) with a BMI of ≥ 30 kg/m2 and BMI ≤ 40 kg/m2.  The Orbera Post Approval Study will enroll up to 284 enrollees to yield approximately 255 subjects treated with the Orbera from 10 to 20 US clinical study sites.  The primary study objective is to demonstrate that the incidence of device and procedure-related SAEs after 26 weeks of Orbera treatment will be no greater than 15%.  Currently, this study has enrolled 207 subjects from a total of 12 clinical study sites.  Enrollment is expected to be completed in September 2018 based on current enrollment rates.
In February of 2017, the FDA issued a letter to health care providers of events of balloon spontaneous over-inflation and, separately, reports of acute pancreatitis.  We subsequently developed updates to Orbera's product labeling and physician training materials, and these were approved by FDA and implemented in June 2017. The labeling changes included additions to the “Warnings” and “Possible Complications” sections and an update to the “Clinical Evaluations…” sub-section within the “Adverse Events” history for Orbera. 
In August of 2017 the FDA issued an update to alert health care providers of five reports of unanticipated deaths that occurred since 2016 in patients with a liquid-filled intragastric balloon system.  Four of the deaths involved patients who had received an Orbera and had been self-reported by us to the FDA as part of our normal product surveillance process.  As stated in the Orbera Directions For Use in the period from January 1, 2006 through March 31, 2017, there had been 21 reported deaths of patients while they had an Orbera with an incident rate of less than 0.01% of the more than 277,000 Orbera balloons distributed during that time period.  The FDA’s letter to Health Care Providers does not indicate that the patient deaths were related to the Orbera device or the insertion procedures. While the cause of death has not been provided or determined in all 
cases, we have not received any communication or indication from the attending physicians or hospitals that the reported deaths were caused by the Orbera device. In total, Apollo has reported five instances of death involving patients who had received an Orbera since receiving FDA approval in August 2015 with four of the incidents occurring outside the United States; the overall incident rate of patient death remains less than 0.01%.
In May 2016, we launched the Orbera Coach platform, an on-demand telehealth program that provides virtual post-implant support tailored to meet the needs of patients who undergo the Orbera procedure. The platform was co-developed with Zillion Health, a private company.
OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System
The OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System ("OverStitch") enables advanced endoscopic procedures by allowing physicians to place full-thickness sutures and secure the approximation of tissue through a flexible endoscope. OverStitch is currently the only U.S. cleared flexible endoscopic suturing device capable of full-thickness suturing of tissue. OverStitch is a mechanical suturing device that operates in cooperation with a flexible endoscope and allows a user to access portions of a patient's gastrointestinal tract and place sutures through the full thickness of a patient's tissue using endoscopic visualization. The OverStitch Endoscopic Suture System received U.S. FDA 510(k) clearance in August 2008 and CE Mark in November 2012. 
OverStitch is compatible with a dual channel flexible endoscope that has limited market presence, representing less than five percent of the flexible endoscopes in hospitals and clinics around the world. We also are working to develop and bring to market the OverStitch Sx Endoscopic Suturing System ("OverStitch Sx") that will be compatible with single-channel flexible endoscopes of diameters ranging from 8.8 mm to 9.8 mm, the majority of flexible endoscopes in hospitals and clinics around the world today. 
The functionality of the OverStitch device allows it to be used for a broad number of bariatric (both revisional and primary) and non-bariatric applications. Since its market introduction in 2008, approximately 25,000 OverStitch units have been sold for procedures worldwide.
One of the most promising newly developed weight-loss procedures is endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty ("ESG"), which transorally uses endoscopic suturing with OverStitch to reduce the volume of the stomach and form a small diameter sleeve, similar to the goal of a surgical sleeve gastrectomy procedure but without the invasiveness and need for amputation of the gastric remnant. The advantages of the ESG as compared to a surgical sleeve includes maintaining the structural integrity of the gastric wall, reversibility, relative ease of revision or maintenance, lower procedure adverse events, and reduced costs.
ESG is based on the placement of full-thickness sutures to secure the approximation of tissue which is the labeled indication of OverStitch. However, the labeled indication of the OverStitch device currently does not specifically identify the ESG procedure. The first multicenter study was presented in May 2016 at Digestive Disease Week which was updated to a 24-month follow-up study and was published in April 2017 in Obesity Surgery, the Journal of Metabolic Surgery and Allied Care. This was a three center (two in the U.S. and one in Spain) study of medical records of patients who underwent ESG from January 2013 to November 2015. All procedures were performed in a similar fashion using the OverStitch device to place full-thickness sutures to fold in the greater curvature of the stomach, creating endolumenally a narrow sleeve with the goal of reducing gastric functional capacity.
A total of 248 patients were included in the study. Patient BMI at the start of the study was 37.8, plus or minus 5.6.

• | 215 patients reached 6-months follow-up and the study reported an average TBWL of 15.2%.


• | 57 patients reached 24-months follow-up and the study reported an average TBWL of 18.6%


• | There was no significant difference in weight loss between the three centers.

Five serious adverse events occurred: two perigastric inflammatory fluid collections that resolved with percutaneous drainage and antibiotics, one self-limited hemorrhage from splenic laceration, one pulmonary embolism 72 hours after the procedure, and one pneumoperitoneum and pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement. All five patients recovered fully. Most of the serious adverse events were associated by the authors with suturing to reduce the fundus part of the stomach and as a result, reducing the fundus is no longer part of the standard ESG technique.
In 2017, we entered into a clinical trial agreement with The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota to undertake the MERIT-Trial (Multi-center ESG Randomized Interventional Trial) to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of ESG compared to efficacy endpoints set forth in a consensus statement of the ASGE and the American Society of Metabolic Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and its impact on obesity related comorbidities in patients with obesity and BMI between 30-45.
The MERIT-Trial is expected to enroll two hundred patients, stratified into three groups (Obesity, Obesity with hypertension, Obesity with diabetes). The trial will have two levels: (1) the randomized study phase with primary outcomes for both treatment and control participants evaluated at twelve months, and (2) the crossover, non-randomized study phase with outcomes for (a) the initial treatment participants at 24 months after their ESG, and (b) the control cross-over participants evaluated at twelve months after their ESG.
In addition, OverStitch is used during procedures for treating a variety of GI defects in both the upper and lower GI tract; including closure of acute perforations and chronic fistulas; inadvertent perforation of the intestines; tissue closure after the removal of abnormal lesions in the esophagus, stomach or colon (also known as endoscopic submucosal dissections and endoscopic mucosal resections) and in the treatment of swallowing disorders (peroral endoscopic myotomy, or POEM). It is also used to suture in place esophageal stents in order to prevent their migration. We estimate that approximately 40% of procedures performed with OverStitch in 2017 were in connection with the treatment of such GI defects.
Also during 2017 we entered into a Registry Funding Agreement with the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Center for GI Innovation and Technology to develop and administer a registry (the “AGA Registry”) to evaluate flexible endoscopic procedures enabled by the OverStitch™ Endoscopic Suturing System.  The AGA Registry will collect real-world evidence related to the safety and efficacy of a number of flexible endoscopic suturing-enabled procedures, including the revisions of patients after a failed bariatric surgery and the fixation of esophageal stents to prevent migration, while collecting data usage on other procedures currently in practice. The resulting data will be used by payors to evaluate the benefits of endoscopic suturing procedures relative to traditional therapies. We expect the AGA Registry to collect data for four years with interim reporting expected. 
Surgical
Our Surgical products consist primarily of the Lap-Band System and accessories used in laparoscopic bariatric surgeries. The Lap-Band System is designed to provide minimally invasive long-term treatment of severe obesity and is an alternative to more invasive surgical stapling procedures such as the gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. The Lap-Band System is an adjustable silicone band that is laparoscopically placed around the upper part of the stomach through a small incision, creating a small pouch at the top of the stomach, which slows the passage of food and creates a sensation of fullness. The procedure can normally be performed as an outpatient procedure, where the patient is able to go home the day of the procedure without the need for an overnight hospital stay.
The Lap-Band System has been in use in Europe since 1993 and was CE marked in 1997. FDA approval in the U.S. was obtained in 2001 and the Lap-Band System has been approved in many countries around the world. More than 860,000 Lap-Band Systems have been distributed worldwide.
The Lap-Band System was approved for use in the U.S. for patients with BMI greater than or equal to 40 or a BMI greater than or equal to 35 with one or more severe comorbid conditions. In 2011, the U.S. FDA granted approval for an expanded indication for the Lap-Band System to include patients with a BMI in the range of 30 to 35 and with one or more comorbid conditions. 
As part of the FDA expansion of the approved indication of the Lap-Band system to include patients with a lower BMI, we are required to conduct a post-approval clinical study. The Lap-Band Lower Body Mass Index (LBMI) Post-approval Study (Apollo-001) is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, post-approval study intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Lap‑Band System in an obese population (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m2 and < 40 kg/m2) with 1 or more obesity-related comorbidities up to 10 years after implantation. The LBMI Post-Approval Study is designed to enroll up to 325 patients from up to 20 clinical study sites.  The primary objective is to assess the percentage of patients who experience an explant of the Lap‑Band System within 5 years of implantation. Secondary objectives include assessment of patients who respond to the Lap‑Band System at 5 years, where response is defined as achieving at least 7%TBWL, assessment of prevalence of diabetes at 5 years, and assessment of changes in obesity-related comorbid conditions at 5 years.  Additional objectives are to evaluate long-term effectiveness (weight loss and comorbidity improvement) and safety (reoperations, esophageal dilatation, esophageal dysmotility, and other device-related and procedure-related adverse events [AEs]).  Currently, this study has enrolled 181 subjects from a total of 13 clinical study sites.  Enrollment for this study has been suspended pending FDA review of the existing data provided in our Final Study Report.
More than 400 peer-reviewed publications and extensive real-world experience demonstrate that laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding surgery using Lap-Band is a safe and effective treatment option for obesity. Adjustable gastric banding using the Lap-Band System has been reported to be significantly safer than gastric bypass while statistically producing the same weight loss 5 years after surgery when accompanied by an appropriate post-operative follow-up and adjustment protocol. Studies have reported sustained resolution or improvement in type 2 diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux, obstructive 
sleep apnea, asthma, arthritis, hypertension and other pre-existing obesity related comorbidities following gastric banding. The gastric banding surgical procedure is generally reimbursed by most payors and insurance programs that cover bariatric surgery.
Competition
We face competition from other interventional therapies for the treatment of obesity that do not use our products as well as from other manufacturers with similar products to ours with the same intended mode of action.
Competing therapies are primarily surgical in nature, such as sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass. Sleeve gastrectomy is a surgical weight-loss procedure in which the stomach is reduced to about 15% of its original size, by the longitudinal resection and removal of a large portion of the stomach along the greater curvature. The result is a sleeve or tube like structure. The procedure permanently reduces the size of the stomach. The procedure is generally performed laparoscopically and is irreversible. Gastric bypass surgery refers to a surgical procedure in which the stomach is divided into a small upper pouch and a much larger lower remnant pouch and then the small intestine is rerouted to connect to the small upper pouch. The procedure leads to a marked reduction in the functional volume of the stomach, accompanied by an altered physiological and physical response to food. Both procedures are normally performed laparoscopically and rely upon surgical staplers as their principal surgical tool. As a result, these procedures are supported by the suppliers of surgical staplers, the largest of whom are Johnson & Johnson (Ethicon) and Medtronic (Covidien). Both companies have substantially more resources than we do.
Outside the U.S., there are a variety of local and regional competitive intragastric balloon and gastric band manufacturers including SC MedSil, Medicone, Allurion Technologies, Spatz Laboratories, Obalon Therapeutics, Inc., Cousin BioTech, and Medical Innovation Development (Midband). In the U.S., there are two other manufacturers with intragastric balloons approved by the FDA at this time, ReShape Lifesciences, Inc., and Obalon Therapeutics, Inc. We are the only manufacturer with an approved gastric band currently on the market in the U.S. We are the only manufacturer with a cleared device for full thickness endoscopic suturing currently on the market in the U.S. or outside the U.S.
Sales and Distribution
We currently market and sell our products principally to providers of medical services and procedures including hospitals, outpatient surgical centers, clinics and physicians through an employee sales force in the U.S., Brazil, Canada, Australia and key markets in Europe. As of December 31, 2017, we employed 48 sales and marketing personnel in the U.S. and another 42 employees in all of the markets outside of the United States. In addition, we sell products to third party distributors who sell our products in approximately 60 other countries.
In the U.S., the gastric banding procedure which uses our Surgical products has obtained reimbursement approval with Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors for patients meeting applicable coverage requirements. Additional markets outside the United States also offer reimbursement approval and coverage requirements for gastric banding. Obesity procedures that utilize the Endo-bariatric products are generally cash pay procedures. Revisions of prior bariatric surgery using endoscopic suturing have received reimbursement approval on a case-by-case basis. Medical procedures that utilize endoscopic suturing products in the treatment of GI defects generally receive reimbursement approval but coverage can vary by country, state and procedure performed.
Manufacturing and Product Supply
We manage all aspects of product supply through our operations team based in Austin, Texas. We operate a manufacturing facility in the Coyol Free Trade Zone in Alajuela, Costa Rica that initially performed final assembly for the Lap-Band and Orbera products. Beginning in 2016, we started to produce components related to the OverStitch system at this facility and intend to expand the number and volume of OverStitch system products and components produced in Costa Rica over the next two years. In addition, we rely on several third-party suppliers to provide components used in existing products and we expect to continue to do so, including final assembly of the OverStitch and OverStitch Sx endoscopic suturing system.
We believe that our existing manufacturing facilities give us the necessary physical capacity to produce sufficient quantities of products to meet anticipated demand for at least the next twelve months. Our manufacturing facility is certified by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and operates under the FDA's good manufacturing practice requirements for medical devices set forth in the Quality System Regulation, ("QSR").
Research and Development
As of December 31, 2017, we had 13 employees focused on research and development. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $8.3 million and $7.8 million, respectively.
Intellectual Property
We have developed and acquired significant know-how and proprietary technology, upon which our business depends. To protect our know-how and proprietary technology, we rely on trade secret laws, patents, copyrights, trademarks and confidentiality agreements and contracts. However, these methods afford only limited protection. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or technology, gain access to our trade secrets or disclose or use such secrets or technology without our approval.
We protect trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. We cannot assure you that our trade secrets will not become known to or be independently developed by our competitors.
Apart from the portfolio of patents and applications to the Lpath technology, we own over 115 U.S. patents and 180 foreign patents. Our U.S. patents have expiration dates ranging from 2018 to 2035 and our foreign patents have expiration dates ranging from 2020 to 2034 subject to the payment of the requisite renewal fees. We also own 28 pending U.S. patent applications and 49 pending foreign patent applications. We believe patents will be issued pursuant to such applications, but cannot guarantee it. Moreover, neither the timing of any issuance, the scope of protection, nor the actual issue date of these pending applications can be forecasted with precision. Where we have licensed patent rights from third parties, we are generally required to pay royalties. While our patents are an important element of our products and future product development, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent.
Our patents may not provide us with effective competitive advantages. Our pending or future patent applications may not be issued. Others may hold or obtain patents that cover aspects or uses of our innovations. The patents of others may render our patents obsolete, limit our ability to patent or practice our innovations, or otherwise have an adverse effect on the ability to conduct business. Because foreign patents may afford less protection than U.S. patents, they may not adequately protect our technology.
In 2009, we entered into an Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement, with Olympus Corporation and the "FTE Group" comprised of The Johns Hopkins University, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, The University of Texas Medical Branch, MUSC Foundation for Research Development and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, whereby the "FTE Group" has assigned to us a Joint Research Agreement with Olympus Corporation, including their rights in certain inventions, patents and IP rights developed by FTE Group under the Joint Research Agreement, which relate to the field of flexible endoscopy and minimally invasive surgery. Olympus Corporation has retained rights as a joint owner of certain inventions and related patents developed jointly by FTE Group and Olympus Corporation under the Joint Research Agreement and retained a license granted by FTE Group to Olympus Corporation to the inventions and related patents developed by FTE Group under the Joint Research Agreement. The patents covered by the agreement pertain to endoscopic procedures and endoscopic suturing devices that relate to the OverStitch products and may also be incorporated into potential new products that we may develop in the future. As consideration for the assignment, we are obligated to pay to each of Olympus and the FTE Group one half of a royalty in the low single digits on net sales of our products covered by the patents, which royalty shall be reduced if related patents have expired or no longer exist. In addition, we have the right to sublicense our rights under the Joint Research Agreement to the patents and technologies. The term of the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement is through and until termination. The agreement may be terminated upon written notice a) by Olympus if we materially breach any material terms that pertain to Olympus and the breach is not cured within 30 days after notice, b) by the FTE Group if we materially breach any of the material terms that pertain to the FTE Group and the breach is not cured within 30 days after notice or c) by us if Olympus materially breaches any material terms that pertain to Olympus and the breach is not cured within 30 days after notice.
Following the Merger, we also own 47 U.S. and foreign issued patents and 29 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications relating to technologies and inventions developed by Lpath prior to the Merger (the “Lpath IP”). The Lpath IP is not aligned with our current business activities. In January 2018, we entered into a royalty-bearing License Agreement with Echelon Biosciences, Inc., ("Echelon") under which Echelon may manufacture and sell certain antibody products covered by the Lpath IP for non-clinical research use only, clinical diagnostics and immunohistochemistry. In January 2018 we also entered a Technology Transfer Agreement with Resolute Pharma, Inc. (“Resolute”) whereby we transferred certain scientific and research materials to Resolute and granted Resolute a license to certain patent rights related to the Lpath IP. Under the terms of the agreement with Resolute, Resolute has obligations to develop and commercialize licensed products and we maintain rights to terminate the agreement if certain development and commercialization milestones are not met. Under the agreement, Resolute is responsible to pay for any ongoing costs and fees associated with the Lpath IP, and we are entitled to a royalty for any revenues related to the Lpath IP including sales of licensed products, and a Tech Transfer Fee of $500,000 by July 31, 2019 which increases to $750,000 if paid after this date. In addition, Resolute has a certain buyout option for the Licensed Patents or Licensed Products.
Government Regulation
The healthcare industry, and thus our business, is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change.
Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (or "FD&C Act") also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a premarket approval ("PMA") application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
Device Classification
Under the FD&C Act, medical devices are classified into one of three classes-Class I, Class II or Class III-depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness.
Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.    
Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, guidelines and postmarket surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is "substantially equivalent," as defined in the statute, to either:

• | a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or


• | another commercially available, similar device that was cleared through the 510(k) process.

To be "substantially equivalent," the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
After a 510(k) notice is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured.
Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification, including modification to or deviation from design, manufacturing processes, materials, packaging and sterilization that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer's determination. If the FDA requires a new 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application for any modifications to a previously cleared product, the applicant may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until clearance or approval is received. In addition, in these circumstances, the FDA can impose significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite 510(k) or PMA application(s). 
If the FDA determines that the device is not "substantially equivalent" to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements 
of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. Pursuant to amendments to the statute in 2012, a manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.
Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed novel and not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA's satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA's satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
The Orbera intragastric balloon and the Lap-Band System are Class III devices. The OverStitch device is a Class II device. We also sell accessory products, some of which are Class I.
The Investigational Device Process
In the U.S., absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical trials intended to support medical device clearance or approval require an IDE application. Some types of studies deemed to present "non-significant risk" are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and IRB approval is obtained. If the device presents a "significant risk" to human health, as defined by the FDA, the sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials, and although the FDA's approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward for a specified number of subjects, it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product's safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA's IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA's regulations for institutional review board approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable, or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant marketing approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any clinical trial may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application or clearance of a 510(k), for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:

• | the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold;


• | patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected;


• | patients do not comply with trial protocols;


• | patient follow-up is not at the rate expected;


• | patients experience adverse events;


• | patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the products that are part of the trial;


• | device malfunctions occur with unexpected frequency or potential adverse consequences;


• | side effects or device malfunctions of similar products already in the market that change the FDA's view toward approval of new or similar PMAs or clearance of a 510(k) or result in the imposition of new requirements or testing;


• | institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol;


• | third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, investigator agreement, investigational plan, good clinical practices, the IDE regulations or other FDA or IRB requirements;


• | third-party investigators are disqualified by the FDA;


• | data collection, monitoring and analysis is not performed in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans, or otherwise fail to comply with the IDE regulations governing responsibilities, records and reports of sponsors of clinical investigations;


• | third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to us or our study such that the FDA deems the study results unreliable, or the company or investigators fail to disclose such interests;


• | regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials;


• | changes in government regulations or administrative actions;


• | the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; or


• | the FDA concludes that our trial design is unreliable or inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.

The PMA Approval Process   
Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant's response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. The FDA considers a PMA or PMA supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an FDA request for information (e.g., major deficiency letter) within a total of 360 days. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee's recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct a bioresearch monitoring inspection of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, and a QSR inspection of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application is to take 180 days, although the review generally takes between one and three years, or longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:

• | the device may not be shown safe or effective to the FDA's satisfaction;


• | the data from pre-clinical studies and/or clinical trials may be found unreliable or insufficient to support approval;


• | the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and


• | changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.

If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, the latter of which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA's evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data are submitted in an amendment to the PMA, or the PMA is withdrawn and resubmitted when the data are available. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which the FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.
New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modification to the manufacturing process, equipment or facility, quality control procedures, sterilization, packaging, expiration date, labeling, device specifications, components, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information 
needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change.
In approving a PMA application, as a condition of approval, the FDA may also require some form of postmarket studies or postmarket surveillance, whereby the applicant follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional or longer term safety and effectiveness data for the device. The FDA may require postmarket surveillance for certain devices approved under a PMA or cleared under a 510(k) notification, such as implants or life-supporting or life-sustaining devices used outside a device user facility, devices where the failure of which would be reasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences, or devices expected to have significant use in pediatric populations. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use.
Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

• | the FDA's QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;


• | labeling regulations, unique device identification requirements and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses;


• | advertising and promotion requirements;


• | restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device;


• | PMA annual reporting requirements;


• | PMA approval or clearance of a 510(k) for product modifications;


• | medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;


• | medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;


• | recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death;


• | an order of repair, replacement or refund;


• | device tracking requirements; and


• | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.

We have registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and have obtained authorization to manufacture from the FDA. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA Office of Compliance within the Center for Devices and Radiological Health to determine our compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers.
Fraud and Abuse Laws
Our business is regulated by laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by significant criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Because of the far-reaching nature of these laws, we may be required to alter one or more of our practices to remain in compliance with these laws. Evolving interpretations of current laws, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could adversely affect arrangements with customers and physicians. In addition, any violation of these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of our operations.
Anti-Kickback Statute
Subject to a number of statutory exceptions, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the furnishing, recommending, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for, a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including payments to physicians or other providers, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments and providing anything of value at less than fair market value. The Office of the Inspector General ("OIG") of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") and the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") are responsible for enforcing the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the OIG is primarily responsible for identifying fraud and abuse activities affecting government healthcare programs.
Penalties for violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include substantial criminal fines and/or imprisonment, substantial civil fines and possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only by government healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs and do not include comparable exceptions to those provided by the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.
The OIG has issued safe harbor regulations that identify activities and business relationships that are not treated as offenses under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. These safe harbors exist for various types of arrangements, including certain investment interests, leases, personal service arrangements, discounts and management contracts. The failure of a particular activity to comply with all requirements of an applicable safe harbor regulation does not mean that the activity violates the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or that prosecution will be pursued. However, activities and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG.
In recent years, the federal government and several states have enacted legislation requiring biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device companies to establish marketing compliance programs and file periodic reports on sales, marketing and other activities. Similar legislation is being considered in other states. Many of these requirements are new and uncertain, and available guidance is limited. We could face enforcement action, fines and other penalties and could receive adverse publicity, all of which could harm our business, if it is alleged that we have failed to fully comply with such laws and regulations. Similarly, if the physicians or other providers or entities that we do business with are found to have not complied with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative impact on our business.
Federal False Claims Act
The federal False Claims Act ("FCA") prohibits knowingly filing or causing the filing of a false claim or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. A claim that is filed pursuant to an unlawful kickback may be a false claim under this law and, in a number of cases, manufacturers of medical products have entered into settlements based on FCA allegations that their financial relationships with customers "caused" these customers to submit false claims. When an entity is determined to have violated the FCA, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. Private individuals can file suits under the FCA on behalf of the government. These lawsuits are known as "qui tam" actions, and the individuals bringing such suits, sometimes known as "relators" or, more commonly, "whistleblowers," may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Since complaints related to “qui tam” actions are initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before a defendant is even aware of such action. Thus, we may currently be subject to an investigation for alleged FCA violations pursuant to one or more qui tam actions, which may be under full or partial seal, thereby preventing disclosure of such action or actions at this time. In addition, certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal FCA. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action. The time and expense associated with responding to such investigations, and any related qui tam or other actions, may be extensive, and we cannot predict the results of our review of the responsive documents and underlying facts or the results of such actions. The costs of responding to government investigations, defending any claims raised, and any resulting fines, restitution, damages and penalties (including under the FCA), settlement payments or administrative actions, as well as any related actions brought by stockholders or other third parties, could have a material impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business.
HIPAA
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government-sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.
HIPAA also protects the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates. HIPAA restricts the use and disclosure of patient health information, including patient records. Although we believe that HIPAA does not apply directly to us, most of our customers have significant obligations under HIPAA, and we intend to cooperate with customers and others to ensure compliance with HIPAA with respect to patient information. Failure to comply with HIPAA obligations can result in civil fines and/or criminal penalties. Some states have also enacted rigorous laws or regulations protecting the security and privacy of patient information. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face additional sanctions.
Healthcare Reform and Compliance 
In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or together, the ACA. The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose increased taxes. Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a medical device excise tax on U.S. sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013. We began paying the medical device excise tax in January 2013.
In December 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 was implemented, which suspended the medical device excise tax implemented as part of the ACA for a two-year period through December 31, 2017. In January 2018, the moratorium on the medical device tax was extended an additional two years, through the end of 2019.
The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or PPSA, which is part of the ACA, requires manufacturers of drugs, biologics, devices and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report these data to CMS, for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted in several states, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals. Particularly, some states such as Massachusetts and Vermont impose an outright ban on certain gifts to physicians. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. We are current with all required reports under the PPSA.
Additionally, the compliance environment is changing, with more states, such as California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts, mandating implementation of compliance programs, compliance with industry ethics codes, and spending limits, and other states, such as Vermont, requiring reporting to state governments of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting regulatory environment, along with the requirement to comply in multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and reporting requirements, increases the possibility that a company may run afoul of one or more laws.
International Regulation
Our business is also subject to regulation in each of the foreign countries in which our products are sold. Many of the regulations applicable to our products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA. The European Union requires that medical devices comply with the Medical Device Directive or the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive, which includes quality system and CE certification requirements. To obtain a CE Mark in the European Union, defined products must meet minimum standards of safety and quality (i.e., the essential requirements) and then undergo an appropriate conformity assessment procedure. A Notified Body assesses the quality management systems of the manufacturer and verifies the conformity of devices to the essential and other requirements within the Medical Device Directive. In the European Union, we are also required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to sell products. We are also subject to regulations and periodic review from various regulatory bodies in other countries where our products are sold. Lack of regulatory compliance in any of these jurisdictions could limit our ability to distribute products in these countries. We are also subject to foreign laws and regulations governing the marketing and promotion of our products including transparency reporting obligations.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of 
obtaining or retaining business. Many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are, either directly or indirectly, with governmental entities and employees (such as physicians at state-owned or state-operated hospitals) and are therefore subject to various anti-bribery laws. Although our corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we sell to customers in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our policies and procedures are designed to both prevent as well as detect reckless or criminal acts committed by employees, distributors, consultants, or agents, but such controls, policies, and procedures may not always protect us from violations. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Other Regulations
We are also subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to such matters as safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research and development and manufacturing activities. Specifically, the manufacture of our products is subject to compliance with various international and federal laws and regulations and by various foreign, state and local agencies. Although we believe we are in compliance with these laws and regulations in all material respects, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with these and other laws or regulations in the future.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 213 full-time employees. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Our non-U.S. employment contracts comply with the applicable country mandated collective agreement in the locations where we operate. We have never experienced any work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
