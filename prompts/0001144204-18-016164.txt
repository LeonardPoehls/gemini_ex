Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc.
 
Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was formed on February 27, 2014 and owns all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pilgrim Bank. On October 10, 2014, Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. completed its initial public offering of common stock. In the offering, Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. sold 2,182,125 shares of its common stock for an aggregate amount of $21,821,250 in total offering proceeds, and issued an additional 65,464 shares of its common stock to the Pilgrim Bank Foundation, resulting in an aggregate issuance of 2,247,589 shares of common stock.
 
Our executive and administrative office is located at 40 South Main Street, Cohasset, Massachusetts 02025, and our telephone number at this address is (781) 383-0541. Our website address is www.bankpilgrim.com. Information on our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report and should not be considered part of this Annual Report.
 
Pilgrim Bank
 
Pilgrim Bank is a Massachusetts stock co-operative bank that was originally organized in 1916 under the name Pilgrim Co-operative Bank as a Massachusetts mutual co-operative bank. In 2005, the Bank changed its name to Pilgrim Bank.
 
We conduct our operations from our main office and an adjacent operations center in Cohasset, Massachusetts and our two additional full-service banking offices located in Cohasset and Marion, Massachusetts. Our business consists primarily of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate, commercial real estate, multi-family and construction loans, and, to a lesser extent, commercial and industrial and consumer loans. We have historically conducted our lending operations with a view towards the specific needs of customers in the communities that we serve, measuring our success by customer satisfaction and the extent of our customer relationships, rather than on volume based loan origination.
 
Market Area and Competition
 
Our primary market area is the South Shore and South Coast areas of Massachusetts, which includes portions of Plymouth, Norfolk and Bristol counties. We serve customers located in a number of small towns in these areas, including Cohasset, Scituate, Hull, Hingham, Norwell, Marshfield, Marion, Mattapoisett, Plymouth, Rochester and Wareham. Although our current operations are not focused in Boston, we are affected by economic conditions in Boston because our loan portfolio includes a significant number of loans that are secured by real estate or that have borrowers located in Boston. In addition, a number of our customers who reside in our market area are employed in Boston and a number of our non-owner occupied residential and multi-family loan customers have properties in Boston as well as in our market area. We intend to continue to make loans, particularly commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction loans, in Boston, so we will continue to be affected by economic conditions in Boston.
 
Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do, which could affect our ability to grow and remain profitable on a long-term basis. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected.

Lending Activities
 
General. As a traditional thrift institution, we have historically focused on one- to four-family owner occupied residential lending, including jumbo mortgages and owner occupied construction. In recent years, we have expanded to include non-owner occupied investment residential, commercial real estate, multi-family and construction loans, and, to a lesser extent, commercial and industrial and consumer loans. Subject to market conditions and our asset-liability analysis, we expect to continue to increase our focus on commercial real estate and multi-family, construction and commercial and industrial lending, in an effort to diversify our overall loan portfolio and increase the overall yield earned on our loans. From time to time, for purposes of managing interest rate risk, we also sell in the secondary market some of the long-term fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate, generally on a servicing-retained, non-recourse basis. All of our loan sales to date have been to the Federal Home Loan Bank Mortgage Partnership Finance Program. In addition, for purposes of managing interest rate risk, generating income and diversifying our portfolio, we regularly purchase owner occupied residential real estate loans and consumer loans, particularly automobile loans. Residential real estate loans are purchased on either a servicing released or servicing retained basis. These loans are high quality loans and are usually purchased from another bank. Automobile loans are purchased at 90% of the outstanding balance and the seller retains 10% ownership as well as the servicing.
Loan Portfolio Composition. The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio, by type of loan at the dates indicated, excluding loans held for sale.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Pursuant to applicable law, the aggregate amount of loans that we are permitted to make to any one borrower or a group of related borrowers is generally limited to 20% of Pilgrim Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Our board of directors has adopted an in-house limit for loans to one borrower or a group of related borrowers equal to $4.0 million.
 
Our lending is subject to written underwriting standards and origination procedures. Decisions on loan applications are made on the basis of detailed applications submitted by the prospective borrower. In addition, for one- to four-family residential, non-owner occupied residential, commercial real estate and multi-family loans we generally obtain an appraisal from an independent licensed appraiser and a secondary review by a separate independent licensed appraiser. In certain circumstances where the total loan amount is less than $250,000, we may rely on internal valuations or tax assessments in lieu of an independent appraisal. All appraisers are approved by our board of directors, and the appraisers that we utilize to perform secondary reviews do not perform primary appraisals for us. The loan applications are designed primarily to determine the borrower’s ability to repay the requested loan, and the more significant items on the application are verified through use of credit reports, financial statements and tax returns.
 
Lending personnel have approval authority commensurate with their experience and loan performance history. Loans in excess of any officer’s individual authority and up to the “in-house limit” established by the board of directors and loans containing any exceptions to our loan policies must be approved by the Executive Committee, which is comprised of our President and Chief Executive Officer and three independent members of our board of directors.  The Executive Committee serves as the Loan Committee. Loans in excess of the “in-house limit” must be approved by the board of directors. The Bank also engages an independent third party to conduct loan reviews on all lending relationships in excess of $1.0 million. This review is performed on an annual basis.
 
Fixed and Adjustable-Rate Loan Schedule. The following table sets forth our fixed- and adjustable-rate loans at December 31, 2017 that are contractually due after December 31, 2018.

One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Lending. The focus of our lending program has historically been the origination of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2017, we had $143.4 million of loans secured by one- to four-family real estate, representing 64.9% of our total loan portfolio, which includes $40.3 million of loans secured by non-owner occupied residential real estate, representing 18.3% of our total loan portfolio. We primarily originate adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans, but we also offer fixed-rate residential mortgage loans and home equity loans. At December 31, 2017, $86.0 million, or 60.0% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans, were fixed-rate loans, and $57.4 million, or 40.0% of such loans were adjustable-rate loans.

Our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans are generally underwritten according to FHLB Mortgage Partnership Financing Program and Freddie Mac guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” We generally originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency for Freddie Mac, which as of December 31, 2017, was generally greater than $424,000 for single-family homes in our market area. We also originate owner-occupied residential mortgage loans above the lending limit for conforming loans to borrowers, which are referred to as “jumbo loans,” generally to borrowers in our market area. Our jumbo loans are generally adjustable-rate loans, although we have in the past, subject to market and competitive conditions, originated long-term fixed-rate jumbo loans. At December 31, 2017, we had jumbo loans of $70.0 million, or 48.8% of our owner occupied one- to four-family residential loans and 31.7% of our total loans, of which $22.1 million were originated by Pilgrim Bank and $47.9 million were purchased loans. The original balances on these loans were $75.8 million, of which $24.8 million were originated by Pilgrim Bank and $51.0 million were purchased loans.
 
We generally limit the loan-to-value ratios of our owner-occupied mortgage loans to 80% of the sales price or appraised value, whichever is lower. Private mortgage insurance is generally required on all loans with loan-to-value ratios above 80%.
 
Our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans typically have terms of 10 to 30 years. Historically, we offered a wide variety of initial terms on our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans; however, in recent years we have begun offering initial terms of three or five years on our adjustable-rate loans. In both instances, the interest rate adjusts annually at a margin after the initial term. Our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans carry terms to maturity ranging from 10 to 30 years. Our loans on second homes typically have terms of 10 to 30 years.
 
Recent changes to residential mortgage lending regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may have an impact on future mortgage business. We intend to underwrite Qualified Mortgages (“QM Loans”) as defined by the regulations. In addition, our Board of Directors has authorized the origination of mortgage loans that qualify for the small creditor exemption. Based on our market area, many of our future residential mortgages will be covered by this exemption. We have no plans to issue non-QM loans at this time.
 
We also offer home equity loans (second mortgages) and lines of credit in both a first and second position. At December 31, 2017, we had $2.6 million, or 1.1% of our loan portfolio, in home equity lines of credit. Additionally, at December 31, 2017 the unadvanced amounts of home equity lines of credit totaled $2.9 million. Our home equity lines of credit are secured by residential property, and generally have terms of fifteen years with a 10- year draw period and 5-year or 10-year repayment periods. We generally do not originate home equity loans, or home equity lines of credit unless the loan-to-value ratio, combined with the first mortgage, is less than 75%, Our home equity lines of credit are all adjustable-rate, bearing interest rates based upon the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate.
 
We may sell a certain amount of the loans we originate into the secondary market. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we sold $1.3 million and $2.2 million of residential mortgage loans, respectively. At December 31, 2017, we were servicing a portfolio of $16.8 million of residential mortgage loans that we had originated and sold. See “—Originations, Purchases and Sales of Loans.”

Commercial Real Estate, Multi-Family and Non-Owner Occupied Residential Lending. Consistent with our strategy to diversify our loan portfolio and increase our yield, we are focused on increasing our origination of commercial real estate loans, with a target loan size of $1.0 million to $1.3 million. At December 31, 2017, we had $24.4 million in commercial real estate loans, representing 11.0% of our total loan portfolio, $21.4 million in multi-family loans, representing 9.7% of our total loan portfolio and $40.3 million in non-owner occupied residential loans, representing 18.2% of our total loan portfolio. Subject to future economic, market and regulatory conditions, we intend to engage in a disciplined increase in commercial real estate, multi-family and non-owner occupied residential lending in our market area.
 
Our commercial real estate and multi-family loans typically have terms of 25 years. Recently, as we have endeavored to customize these loans to meet the needs of our customers, they generally have initial terms of up to five years and amortization terms of 20 to 25 years with a balloon payment at the end of the initial term. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our commercial real estate loans and multi-family loans is generally 70% of the lower of cost or appraised value of the property securing the loan, subject to increase up to 75% upon the approval of the Executive Committee. Our commercial real estate loans are typically secured by retail, industrial, warehouse, service, medical or other commercial properties, and our multi-family loans are typically secured by five and six unit residential properties or apartment buildings.
 
We also offer mortgages on non-owner occupied, or “investment,” one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, which we underwrite using the same guidelines and standards applicable to commercial real estate and multi-family loans. These loans have terms of five to ten years, subject to increase up to 30 years upon approval of the Executive Committee. We generally limit the loan-to-value ratios of non-owner occupied one- to four-family residential loans to 75% of the sales price or appraised value, whichever is lower, subject to an increase to 80% upon approval of the Executive Committee. These loans are all adjustable-rate loans, and require a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.20x.
 
We may hire additional experienced lenders in the future to increase our pipeline of commercial real estate, multi-family and investment property loans. During 2017, we also offered loans with guarantees through the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) 504 Program. We intend to increase this activity in the future. The Section 504 Program effectively splits one loan into two, with Pilgrim Bank taking the first and the SBA taking the second. The reduction in loan to value provided under the Section 504 Program reduces our credit risk. In addition to utilizing the SBA 504 Program, we are approved as an SBA lender. We plan to participate in the SBA Express and SBA 7a Program for small business lending. We expect to utilize this relationship to support our efforts to diversify our lending into commercial and industrial lending as well as commercial real estate lending.
 
Construction and Land Lending. At December 31, 2017, we had an outstanding balance of $25.3 million, or 11.5% of our total loan portfolio, in construction and land loans, and $10.2 million in unfunded commitments. Of these, $11.2 million in outstanding loans and $5.8 million in unfunded commitments were for acquisition development and construction loans, $1.8 million in outstanding loans and $700,000 in unfunded commitments were for non-owner occupied multi-family construction loans, $6.6 million in outstanding loans and $2.6 million in unfunded commitments were for one-to-four family speculative construction loans, $1.7 million in outstanding loans and $100,000 in unfunded commitments were for commercial real estate investment construction loans, $1.1 million in outstanding loans and $1.0 million in unfunded commitments were in for one-to-four family owner occupied construction loans, and $2.9 million in outstanding loans with no unfunded commitments were loans on vacant land.

Our owner-occupied residential construction loans generally have initial terms of up to 12 months, during which the borrower pays interest only. Upon completion of construction, these loans convert to conventional amortizing mortgage loans. Our residential construction loans have rates and terms comparable to one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our residential construction loans is generally 75% of the appraised value of the completed property. Residential construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating permanent residential mortgage loans, except that all residential construction loans are appraised by independent appraisers and borrowers are generally required to exhibit the ability to absorb unforeseen cost overruns.
 
Our commercial real estate, multi-family, and non-owner occupied residential construction loans generally have initial terms of up to 24 months depending on the individual project, during which the borrower pays interest only. Multi-family and non-owner occupied residential construction loans are renovation loans, or ground up construction loans, that either automatically convert to permanent at the end of the construction period or are marketed for sale. These loans, particularly non-owner occupied residential, have been a significant lending opportunity during recent years. Commercial real estate construction projects are typically land acquisition and development projects of single family units that do not automatically convert to a permanent loan. The maximum “as completed” loan-to-value for non-owner occupied, commercial real estate and multi-family loans is 70%, however the Executive Committee has the authority to approve an exception for a higher limit, if warranted. Commercial real estate, multi-family and non-owner occupied residential construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating permanent commercial real estate, multi-family and non-owner occupied residential loans. All loans are appraised by independent appraisers and subject to a review by a secondary independent appraiser. Borrowers are generally required to absorb cost overruns and be able to carry the property until it is sold or leased.
 
To a lesser extent, we make loans for the speculative construction and development of one- to four-family residential lots by well-known established builders in our market area. These loans are originated pursuant to the same standards as, and generally have terms similar to, commercial construction loans. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of speculative construction and land development loans is generally 70%. Land development loans require a 20% minimum down payment, or 40% where the development is not expected to commence immediately.
 
All construction and land development loans are appraised by independent appraisers. All borrowers are required to obtain title insurance, property and casualty insurance, and, if the property is determined to be located in a flood zone area, flood insurance. Either the Bank or an independent third party inspects the properties for progress and recommends all draws, consistent with the work performed to date. All draws are approved by the President and Chief Executive Officer.
 
Commercial and Industrial Lending. At December 31, 2017, we had $2.8 million of commercial and industrial loans outstanding, representing 1.3% of our total loan portfolio, and $477,000 of unfunded commitments. Our commercial and industrial loans are generally annual revolving loans, but we may also offer term loans with terms of five to ten years depending on the needs of the borrower. We make commercial and industrial loans to businesses operating in our market area for purchasing equipment, property improvements, business expansion or working capital. Our commercial and industrial term loans are generally secured by equipment, furniture and fixtures, inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets, or, in very limited circumstances, may be unsecured. If a commercial and industrial loan is secured by equipment, we fix the maturity of a term loan at up to seven years, depending on the useful life of equipment purchased, the source of repayment for the loan and the purpose of the loan. Our revolving lines of credit are generally used to finance short-term working capital needs such as accounts payable and inventory. We generally obtain personal guarantees with commercial and industrial loans. As of December 31, 2017 we had $656,000 of USDA-guaranteed agricultural loans.

We believe that commercial and industrial loans will provide growth opportunities for us, and we expect to increase, subject to our conservative underwriting standards and market conditions, this business line in the future.
 
Consumer Lending. At December 31, 2017, we had $1.0 million, or 0.5% of our loan portfolio, in consumer loans. Of these, $800,000 were automobile loans that we purchased from a local credit union. We offer consumer loans on a very limited basis, and generally as a convenience to customers with whom we have banking relationships.
 
Originations, Purchases and Sales of Loans
 
We originate real estate and other loans through our loan originators, employee referrals, marketing and advertising efforts, our existing customer base, walk-in customers and referrals from customers, real estate brokers, builders and attorneys. All loans that we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures. We may hire additional loan officers and originators to increase our residential lending activity, as needed.
 
We may sell a certain amount of the loans we originate into the secondary market based upon our analysis of our interest rate risk and market conditions, choosing the strategy that is most advantageous to us from a profitability and risk management standpoint. In recent years we have sold only fixed-rate long-term residential mortgages, and have sold these loans exclusively to the Federal Home Loan Bank in conjunction with its Mortgage Partnership Finance (MPF) Program. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we sold $1.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively, of mortgage loans, all on a servicing-retained basis. At December 31, 2017, we serviced $16.8 million of fixed-rate, one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originated and sold in the secondary market.
 
In addition, the purchase of loans or participations in which we are not the lead lender, is a key element of our strategy of maintaining a high loan-to-asset level on our balance sheets. When we purchase loans or participations, we follow the loan underwriting and approval policies that apply to the origination of the type of loan being purchased. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased a total of $7.5 million of residential loans, on a servicing-retained basis, and $7.8 million of commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2017, we had $7.8 million of participations purchased, all of which were secured by real estate or USDA guarantees. We may also sell participation interests in loans that we originate and retain the servicing and lead position on the credit. This generally occurs when a loan or relationship either exceeds our lending limits or we determine that it would be prudent to reduce our credit risk exposure with respect to the particular relationship. At December 31, 2017, we had $5.9 million of participations sold.

Asset Quality
 
Delinquency Procedures. When a borrower fails to make a required monthly payment on any loan in the portfolio, we attempt to contact the borrower to determine the reason for nonpayment and to discuss future payments. Our policies provide that collection procedures commence when a loan is 15 days past due. The Executive Committee reviews the delinquencies on a monthly basis and reports collection activity to the Board.
 
We generally place a loan on non-accrual status when it is 90 days past due. When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as foreclosed real estate until it is sold. The real estate is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of acquisition less estimated costs to sell, and any write-down resulting from the acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Estimated fair value is based on a new appraisal which is obtained as soon as practicable, typically after the foreclosure process is completed. Subsequent decreases in the value of the property are charged to operations. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.
 
Troubled Debt Restructurings. During the financial crisis, we were aggressive in our efforts to identify borrower weaknesses and to structure modifications to qualified borrowers in order to help them during periods of financial difficulty. These modifications were either temporary or permanent. Borrowers were granted modifications after a detailed analysis of their current financial situation and future expectations. We modified loans to extend the term or make other concessions to help a borrower stay current on his or her loan and to avoid foreclosure. We generally do not forgive principal on loans or extend the maturity on loans. We may modify the terms of loans to lower interest rates (which may be at below market rates) or to provide for temporary interest-only terms, or to forgive or defer the payment of interest. These modifications are made only when there is a reasonable and attainable workout plan that has been agreed to by the borrower and that is in our best interests. Since 2009, the Bank has modified approximately 22 loans, primarily owner-occupied residential loans, some of which did not meet the definition of a troubled debt restructuring. During 2017, we modified four loans. At December 31, 2017, we had seven loans totaling $3.6 million that were designated as troubled debt restructurings. Once the borrower has demonstrated sustained performance with the modified terms, the loan may be upgraded from its classified and / or non performing status. Any loan categorized as a troubled debt restructuring will continue to retain that designation through the life of the loan, even if the loan is performing under its original contractual terms.

Allowance for Loan Losses 
 
Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses. Our allowance for loan losses is the amount considered necessary to reflect probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings.
 
Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of two key elements: (1) specific allowances for identified impaired loans; and (2) a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio. Although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately, the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio.
 
We identify loans that may need to be charged off as a loss by reviewing all delinquent loans, classified loans, and other loans about which management may have concerns about collectability. For individually reviewed loans, the borrower’s inability to make payments under the terms of the loan as well as the shortfall in collateral value would result in our charging off the loan or the portion of the loan that was impaired.
 
Among other factors, we consider current general economic conditions, including current housing price depreciation, in determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses for our residential real estate portfolio. We use evidence obtained from our own loan portfolio as well as published housing data on our local markets from third party sources we believe to be reliable as a basis for assumptions about the impact of housing depreciation.
 
Substantially all of our loans are secured by collateral. Loans 90 days past due and other classified loans are evaluated for impairment and general or specific allowances are established. Typically for a non-performing real estate loan in the process of collection, the value of the underlying collateral is estimated using the original independent appraisal or a new appraisal as well as other current estimates of value, adjusted for current economic conditions and other factors. Related general or specific reserves are adjusted on a quarterly basis. If a non-performing real estate loan is in the process of foreclosure and/or there are serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, and there is uncertainty about the value of the underlying collateral, we will order a new independent appraisal. Any shortfall would result in immediately charging off the portion of the loan that was impaired.
 
Specific Allowances for Identified Problem Loans. We establish a specific allowance when loans are determined to be impaired. Loss is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling expenses. Factors in identifying a specific problem loan include: (1) the strength of the customer’s personal or business cash flows; (2) the availability of other sources of repayment; (3) the amount due or past due; (4) the type and value of collateral; (5) the strength of our collateral position; (6) the estimated cost to sell the collateral; and (7) the borrower’s effort to cure the delinquency. In addition, for loans secured by real estate, we consider the extent of any past due and unpaid property taxes applicable to the property serving as collateral on the mortgage.
 
General Valuation Allowance on the Remainder of the Loan Portfolio. We establish a general allowance for loans that are not classified as impaired to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, has not been allocated to particular problem assets. This general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience, delinquency trends and management’s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio. The allowance may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management’s judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. These significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary market area, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle and bank regulatory examination results. The applied loss factors are re-evaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current real estate environment.

Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses. The following tables set forth the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan category, the total loan balances by category, and the percent of loans in each category to total loans at the dates indicated. The allowance for loan losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories.

(1) Includes $203,000, or 16.51% of the allowance for loan losses, $105,000, or 9.96% of the allowance for loan losses, $76,000, or 8.58% of the allowance for loan losses, $64,000, or 8.61% of allowance for loan losses, and $62,000, or 8.36% of allowance for loan losses, allocated to non-owner occupied residential loans at December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
 
At December 31, 2017, our allowance for loan losses represented 0.56% of total loans and there was one non-performing loan. At December 31, 2016, our allowance for loan losses represented 0.50% of total loans and there were no non-performing loans. There were no charge-offs or recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2017. There were $8,000 in charge-offs and $1,000 in recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing allowance for loan losses may not be adequate and management may determine that increases in the allowance are necessary if the quality of any portion of our loan portfolio deteriorates as a result. Furthermore, as an integral part of its examination process, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and FDIC will periodically review our allowance for loan losses. The regulators may require that we increase our allowance based on its judgments of information available to it at the time of its examination. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of the operations.

Securities Activities
 
General. The goals of our investment policy are to provide and maintain liquidity to meet deposit withdrawal and loan funding needs, to help mitigate interest rate and market risk, to diversify our assets, and to generate a reasonable rate of return on funds within the context of our interest rate and credit risk objectives. In recent years, beginning with the recession which began in 2008 and the subsequent challenging economic environment, our strategy has been to manage the maturities of our investment securities portfolio within our interest rate risk strategies.
 
Our Board of Directors is responsible for adopting our investment policy. The investment policy is reviewed annually by the Board of Directors and our Executive Committee and any changes to the policy are recommended to and subject to the approval of the Board of Directors. Authority to make investments under the approved investment policy guidelines is delegated to our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. All investment transactions are reviewed at regularly scheduled monthly meetings of the board of directors.
 
U.S. Government and Agency Obligations. At December 31, 2017, we had U.S. government and agency securities with a carrying value of $8.3 million, which constituted 50% of our securities portfolio. While these securities generally provide lower yields than other investments in our securities investment portfolio, we maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate, for liquidity purposes, as collateral for borrowings and for prepayment protection.
 
Mortgage-Backed Securities. At December 31, 2017, we had mortgage-backed securities with a carrying value of $5.1 million, which constituted 31% of our securities portfolio. Mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as “pass-through” certificates because the principal and interest of the underlying loans is “passed through” to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees. Mortgage-backed securities typically are collateralized by pools of one- to four-family or multifamily mortgages, although we invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as Pilgrim Bank. The interest rate of the security is lower than the interest rates of the underlying loans to allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees.
 
Residential mortgage-backed securities issued by United States Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises are more liquid than individual mortgage loans because there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our borrowings. Investments in residential mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. Current prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments.
 
Municipal Securities. At December 31, 2017, we had municipal securities with a carrying value of $3.3 million, which constituted 19% of our securities portfolio. All of our current municipal securities are issued by municipalities in Massachusetts and have maturities not in excess of 15 years. These securities generally provide slightly higher yields than U.S. government and agency securities and mortgage-backed securities, but are not as liquid as such other investments, so we typically maintain investments in municipal securities, to the extent appropriate, for generating returns in our investment portfolio.

Investment Certificates of Deposit With Other Institutions. We invest in certificates of deposit with insured financial institutions in order to increase yields on short-term investments and manage the maturity of our investment portfolio. At December 31, 2017 and 2016 we had $1.1 million in certificates of deposit with other institutions.
Federal Home Loan Bank Stock. We held common stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston in connection with our borrowing activities totaling $2.3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Federal Home Loan Bank common stock is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities. We may be required to purchase additional Federal Home Loan Bank stock if we increase borrowings in the future.
Other Securities. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $384,000 invested in The Co-operative Central Bank reserve fund. The Co-operative Central Bank reserve fund is an illiquid investment.
 
Bank-Owned Life Insurance. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to provide us with a funding source for our benefit plan obligations. Bank-owned life insurance also generally provides us noninterest income that is non-taxable. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, our balance in bank-owned life insurance totaled $2.3 million and was issued by one insurance company.
Securities Portfolio Composition. The following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolio (excluding Federal Home Loan Bank stock and the Co-operative Central Bank reserve fund) at the dates indicated. Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value.

Securities Portfolio Maturities and Yields. The following table sets forth the stated maturities and weighted average yields of our securities at December 31, 2017. Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value. Mortgage-backed securities, including collateralized mortgage obligations, are anticipated to be repaid in advance of their contractual maturities as a result of projected mortgage loan repayments. In addition, under the structure of some of our CMOs, the short- and intermediate-term tranche interests have repayment priority over the longer term tranche interests of the same underlying mortgage pool. Finally, some of our U.S. Treasury and other securities are callable at the option of the issuer. Certain securities have interest rates that are adjustable and will reprice annually within the various maturity ranges. These repricing schedules have not been reflected in the table below.

Sources of Funds
 
General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also use borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston advances, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. To a lesser extent, we may utilize repurchase agreements or federal funds sold as funding sources.
Deposits. Our deposits are generated primarily from residents within our primary market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing checking accounts, passbook and statement savings accounts, variable rate money market accounts, and certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. In 2015, we began to use brokered deposits and in 2016 we began to use listing service deposits as funding sources for lending and investment activities. We have established internal policy limits on brokered deposits of 10% of total deposits and on listing service deposits 15% of total deposits. At December 31, 2017 brokered deposits totaled $9.1 million, or 4.8% of total deposits and at December 31, 2016 brokered deposits totaled $7.3 million, or 4.0% of total deposits. At December 31, 2017, listing service deposits totaled $9.1 million, or 4.8% of total deposits and at December 31, 2016 listing service deposits totaled $2.5 million, or 1.3% of total deposits. At December 31, 2017 our core deposits, which are deposits other than certificates of deposit, were $92.3 million, representing 48.5% of total deposits.
 
In recent years, we have relied for deposit generation on promotional programs and advertising efforts, our reputation in the community for superior customer service, the variety of deposit accounts that we offer, our competitive rates, customer referrals, and cross-marketing efforts with loan customers. We may use promotional rates to meet asset/liability and market segment goals. We intend to continue to focus on increasing our core deposits by providing incentives on new transaction accounts, enhanced online services and mobile banking, and by leveraging commercial lending relationships to increase transaction accounts.
 
Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts that we offer allows us to be competitive in generating deposits and to respond with flexibility to changes in our customers’ demands. Our ability to gather deposits is impacted by the competitive market in which we operate, which includes numerous financial institutions of varying sizes offering a wide range of products. We believe that deposits are a stable source of funds, but our ability to attract and maintain deposits at favorable rates will be affected by market conditions, including competition and prevailing interest rates as consumers become more conscious of interest rates.

Borrowings. We may obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (FHLB) upon the security of certain of our mortgage loans and investment securities. Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. To the extent such borrowings have different terms to repricing than our deposits, they can change our interest rate risk profile. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $40.2 million and $37.3 million, respectively, in outstanding advances from the FHLB. At December 31, 2017, based on available collateral and our ownership of FHLB stock, we had access to additional FHLB advances of up to $51.1 million.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION 
 
General
 
Pilgrim Bank is a Massachusetts stock co-operative bank and is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc., a Maryland corporation, which is a registered bank holding company. Pilgrim Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC, and by the Share Insurance Fund of the Co-Operative Central Bank of Massachusetts for amounts in excess of the FDIC insurance limits. Pilgrim Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, its primary federal regulator and deposit insurer. Pilgrim Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the FDIC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. Pilgrim Bank must comply with consumer protection regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Pilgrim Bank also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, which is one of the twelve regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.
 
As a bank holding company, Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. is subject to examination and supervision by, and is required to file certain reports with, the Federal Reserve Board. Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.

The regulatory and supervisory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance funds, rather than for the protection of stockholders and creditors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies concerning the establishment of deposit insurance assessment fees, classification of assets and establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the Massachusetts legislature, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. and Pilgrim Bank. As is further described below, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and may affect the lending, investment and general operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies.
 
Set forth below are certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable to Pilgrim Bank and Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Pilgrim Bank and Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by Congress or the applicable regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse impact on Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc., Pilgrim Bank and their operations.
 
Dodd-Frank Act
 
The Dodd-Frank Act made significant changes to the regulatory structure for depository institutions and their holding companies. However, the Dodd-Frank Act’s changes go well beyond that and affect the lending, investments and other operations of all depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital for holding companies were restricted to capital instruments that were then currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. The legislation also established a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect upon passage and directed the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.
 
During 2015, The Federal Reserve Board amended its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (the “Policy Statement”). Pursuant to the Policy Statement, the Basel III capital rules do not apply to bank holding companies with less than $1 billion in total assets that meet certain criteria. As Pilgrim Bancshares Inc., meets the criteria specified in the Policy Statement, the Company is not subject to regulatory capital requirements on a consolidated basis.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has extensive rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets are still examined for compliance by their applicable bank regulators. The new legislation also weakened the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations, and gave state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution, rather than on total deposits. The legislation also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. Further, the legislation mandated regulations requiring that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the risk for transferred loans, directed the Federal Reserve Board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage origination.

The Dodd-Frank Act also required the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to issue regulations requiring lenders to make a reasonable good faith determination as to a prospective borrower’s ability to repay a residential mortgage loan. The final “Ability to Repay” rules, which were effective January 10, 2014, establish a “qualified mortgage” safe harbor for loans whose terms and features are deemed to make the loan less risky.
 
Many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act involve delayed effective dates and/or require implementing regulations or have not been issued in final form. Their impact on our operations cannot yet fully be assessed. However, there is a significant possibility that the Dodd-Frank Act will result in an increased regulatory burden and compliance, operating and interest expense for Pilgrim Bank and Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc.
 
Massachusetts Banking Laws and Supervision
 
General. As a Massachusetts-chartered co-operative bank, Pilgrim Bank is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and to various Massachusetts statutes and regulations which govern, among other things, investment powers, lending and deposit-taking activities, borrowings, maintenance of surplus and reserve accounts, distribution of earnings and payment of dividends. In addition, Pilgrim Bank is subject to Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights laws and regulations. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks or the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation is required for a Massachusetts-chartered bank to establish or close branches, merge with other financial institutions, issue stock and undertake certain other activities. Any Massachusetts bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies and directives of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may be sanctioned. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may suspend or remove directors or officers of a bank who have violated the law, conducted a bank’s business in a manner that is unsafe, unsound or contrary to the depositors’ interests, or been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks has the authority to appoint a receiver or conservator if it is determined that the bank is conducting its business in an unsafe or unauthorized manner, and under certain other circumstances.
 
Massachusetts regulations generally allow Massachusetts banks to, with appropriate regulatory approvals, engage in activities permissible for federally chartered banks or banks chartered by another state. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks also has adopted procedures reducing regulatory burdens and expense and expediting branching by well-capitalized and well-managed banks.
 
In 2015, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts adopted a law modernizing the Massachusetts banking law, which affords Massachusetts chartered banks with greater flexibility compared to federally chartered and out-of-state banks.
 
Lending Activities. A Massachusetts-chartered co-operative bank may make a wide variety of mortgage loans including fixed-rate loans, adjustable-rate loans, variable-rate loans, participation loans, graduated payment loans, construction and development loans, condominium and co-operative loans, second mortgage loans and other types of loans that may be made in accordance with applicable regulations. Commercial loans may be made to corporations and other commercial enterprises with or without security. Consumer and personal loans may also be made with or without security.

26
--

Insurance Sales. Massachusetts banks may engage in insurance sales activities if the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks has approved a plan of operation for insurance activities and the bank obtains a license from the Massachusetts Division of Insurance. A bank may be licensed directly or indirectly through an affiliate or a subsidiary corporation established for this purpose. Pilgrim Bank does not sell or refer insurance products, and has not sought approval for insurance sales activities.
Dividends.  A Massachusetts co-operative bank may declare cash dividends from net profits not more frequently than quarterly. Non-cash dividends may be declared at any time. No dividends may be declared, credited or paid if the bank’s capital stock is impaired. A Massachusetts co-operative bank with outstanding preferred stock may not, without the prior approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, declare dividends on the common stock without also declaring dividends on the preferred stock. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years, less any required transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. Net profits for this purpose means the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets after deducting current operating expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all federal and state taxes. Dividends from Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. may depend, in part, upon receipt of dividends from Pilgrim Bank. The payment of dividends from Pilgrim Bank would be restricted by federal law if the payment of such dividends resulted in Pilgrim Bank failing to meet regulatory capital requirements.
Parity Regulation. A Massachusetts bank may, in accordance with Massachusetts law and regulations issued by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, exercise any power and engage in any activity that has been authorized for national banks, federal thrifts or state banks in a state other than Massachusetts, provided that the activity is permissible under applicable federal law and not specifically prohibited by Massachusetts law. Such powers and activities must be subject to the same limitations and restrictions imposed on the national bank, federal thrift or out-of-state bank that exercised the power or activity. Beginning in April 2015, a Massachusetts bank must provide the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks advance written notice prior to engaging in certain activities permissible for national banks, federal thrifts, or out-of-state banks.
Loans to One Borrower Limitations. Massachusetts banking law grants broad lending authority. However, with certain limited exceptions, total obligations to one borrower may not exceed 20% of the total of the bank’s capital stock.
 
Loans to a Bank’s Insiders. Massachusetts banking laws currently prohibit any executive officer or director of a bank from borrowing or guaranteeing extensions of credit by such bank except for any of the following loans or extensions of credit with the approval of a majority of the board of directors: (i) loans or extension of credit, secured or unsecured, to an officer of the bank in an amount not exceeding $100,000; (ii) loans or extensions of credit intended or secured for educational purposes to an officer of the bank in an amount not exceeding $200,000; (iii) loans or extensions of credit secured by a mortgage on residential real estate to be occupied in whole or in part by the officer to whom the loan or extension of credit is made, in an amount not exceeding $750,000; and (iv) loans or extensions of credit to a director of the bank who is not also an officer of the bank in an amount permissible under the bank’s loan to one borrower limit. No such loan or extension of credit may be granted with an interest rate or other terms that are preferential in comparison to loans granted to persons not affiliated with the bank.
 
Beginning in April 2015, Massachusetts law provides that a Massachusetts bank shall comply with Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. See “—Federal Banking Regulation—Transactions with Related Parties.”
 
Investment Activities. In general, Massachusetts-chartered co-operative banks may invest in preferred and common stock of any corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state provided such investments do not involve control of any corporation and do not, in the aggregate, exceed 4% of the bank’s deposits. Federal law imposes additional restrictions on Pilgrim Bank’s investment activities. See “—Federal Banking Regulation—Business Activities.”

Regulatory Enforcement Authority. Any Massachusetts co-operative bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies and directives of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may be subject to sanctions for non-compliance, including revocation of its charter. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated the law, conducted the bank’s business in an unsafe or unsound manner or contrary to the depositors interests or been negligent in the performance of their duties. Upon finding that a bank has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the bank concerned. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks also has authority to take possession of a bank and appoint a liquidating agent under certain conditions such as conducting business in an unsafe, unsound and or unauthorized manner. In addition, Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights statutes applicable to Pilgrim Bank permit private individual and class action law suits and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damage and attorney’s fees in the case of certain violations of those statutes.
Co-Operative Central Bank and Share Insurance Fund.  All Massachusetts-chartered co-operative banks are required to be members of the Co-Operative Central Bank, which maintains the Share Insurance Fund that insures co-operative bank deposits in excess of federal deposit insurance coverage. The Co-Operative Central Bank is authorized to charge co-operative banks an annual assessment fee on deposit balances in excess of amounts insured by the FDIC. Assessment rates are based on the institution’s risk category, similar to the method currently used to determine assessments by the FDIC discussed below under “—Federal Banking Regulation—Insurance of Deposit Accounts.”
Protection of Personal Information. Massachusetts has adopted regulatory requirements intended to protect personal information. The requirements are similar to existing federal laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that require organizations to establish written information security programs to prevent identity theft. The Massachusetts regulation also contains technology system requirements, especially for the encryption of personal information sent over wireless or public networks or stored on portable devices.
 
Massachusetts has other statutes or regulations that are similar to certain of the federal provisions discussed below.
 
Federal Banking Regulation 
 
Business Activities. Under federal law, all state-chartered FDIC-insured banks, including co-operative banks, have been limited in their activities as principal and in their equity investments to the type and the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law. Federal law permits exceptions to these limitations. For example, certain state-chartered co-operative banks may, with FDIC approval, continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange and in the shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The maximum permissible investment is the lesser of 100.0% of Tier 1 capital or the maximum amount permitted by Massachusetts law. Such grandfathered authority may be terminated under certain circumstances including a change in charter or a determination by the FDIC that such investments pose a safety and soundness risk.
 
The FDIC is also authorized to permit state banks to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if they meet all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC has adopted regulations governing the procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 specified that a state bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a “financial subsidiary,” if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes.

Capital Requirements. The FDIC requires federally-insured state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System (“state non-member banks”) to meet minimum capital standards: a 4.5% common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, a 6% Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets ratio, a 4% Tier 1 capital to total average assets leverage ratio, and a 8% total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio.
 
As noted, the risk-based capital standard requires the maintenance of common capital (also referred to as common equity Tier 1 capital), core capital (also referred to as Tier 1 capital) and total capital (which is defined as core capital and supplementary capital) to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%, 6.0% and 8%, respectively. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet exposures, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor of 0% to 1,250%, assigned by the regulations, based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Core or Tier 1 capital is defined as common stockholders’ equity (including retained earnings), certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships. Common equity Tier 1 capital adjusts core or Tier 1 capital for several types of deferred tax assets and liabilities and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. The components of supplementary capital (also referred to as Tier 2 capital) include cumulative preferred stock, long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock, the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Overall, the amount of supplementary capital included as part of total capital cannot exceed 100% of core capital. Additionally, an institution that retains credit risk in connection with an asset sale is required to maintain additional regulatory capital because of the purchaser’s recourse against the institution. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual associations where necessary. At December 31, 2017and 2016, Pilgrim Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements.
 
Capital Rule. Effective January 1, 2015 (with a phase-in period of two to four years for certain components), the Bank became subject to the capital regulations adopted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) and the FDIC, which implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and the changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The regulations require a common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6.0% a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.0% and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. CET1 generally consists of common stock and retained earnings, subject to applicable adjustments and deductions. Under prompt corrective action regulations, in order to be considered “well capitalized,” the Bank must maintain a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% and a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of 8.0%, a total risk based capital ratio of 10.0% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%. In addition, the regulations establish a capital conservation buffer above the required capital ratios that phases in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increases each year by 0.625% until it is fully phased in at 2.5% effective January 1, 2019. Beginning January 1, 2016, failure to maintain the capital conservation buffer limits the ability of the Bank and the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses.
 
A state non-member bank may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required by the FDIC’s regulatory capital regulations or for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form. Pilgrim Bank’s ability to pay dividends is limited by the capital conservation buffer required by the capital rules, which limit the ability of Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. to pay dividends to its stockholders.

Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”) and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of a state non-member bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution’s record of compliance with the CRA. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA does require the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a non-member bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires the FDIC to provide a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. An institution’s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. The CRA requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating. Pilgrim Bank received a “Satisfactory” CRA rating in its most recent federal examination.
 
Massachusetts has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA that is applicable to Pilgrim Bank. The Massachusetts version is generally similar to the CRA but utilizes a five-tiered descriptive rating system. Massachusetts law requires the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks to consider, but not be limited to, a bank’s record of performance under Massachusetts law in considering any application by the bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, to relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution. Pilgrim Bank’s most recent rating under Massachusetts law was “Satisfactory.”
 
In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
 
Transactions with Related Parties. An institution’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as Pilgrim Bank. Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. will be an affiliate of Pilgrim Bank because of its control of Pilgrim Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. Transactions with affiliates also must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, generally not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates.
 
Pilgrim Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders:
 

· | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


30
--


· | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Pilgrim Bank’s capital.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Pilgrim Bank’s loan committee or board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved.
 
Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement responsibility over state non-member banks and has authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an institution. Formal enforcement action by the FDIC may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million per day. The FDIC is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if that bank was “critically undercapitalized” on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became “critically undercapitalized.” The FDIC may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non-member bank under specified circumstances, including: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; (4) insufficient capital; or (5) the incurrence of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance.
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties.
 
Interstate Banking and Branching. Federal law permits well-capitalized and well-managed bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to Federal Reserve Board approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers of banks are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. In addition, among other things, recent amendments made by the Dodd-Frank Act permit banks to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that branching is authorized by the law of the host state for the banks chartered by that state.
 
Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. The FDIC is required by law to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s level of capital.

31
--

 

Under prompt corrective action regulations, in order to be considered “well capitalized,” the Bank must maintain a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%. An institution that has a CET1 risk based capital ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio less than 6.0%, a total risk based capital ratio less than 8.0% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio less than 4.0%, is considered to be undercapitalized. An institution that has a CET1 risk based capital ratio less than 3.0%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio less than 4.0%, a total risk based capital ratio less than 6.0% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio less than 3.0%, is considered to be “significantly undercapitalized.” An institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2% is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.” In addition, the regulations established a capital conservation buffer above the required capital ratios that phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increases each year by 0.625% until it is fully phased in at 2.5% effective January 1, 2019
 
Generally, a receiver or conservator must be appointed for an institution that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date that an institution is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any holding company of an institution that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee performance under the plan in an amount of up to the lesser of 5% of the institution’s assets at the time it was deemed to be undercapitalized by the FDIC or the amount necessary to restore the institution to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the FDIC notifies the institution that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. Institutions that are undercapitalized become subject to certain mandatory measures such as a restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth. The FDIC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.
 
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions such as Pilgrim Bank. Deposit accounts in Pilgrim Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund.
 
Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other risk factors. Rates are based on each institution’s risk category and certain specified risk adjustments. Stronger institutions pay lower rates while riskier institutions pay higher rates. Assessments are based on an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity instead of total deposits. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) currently range from 2 1/2 to 45 basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital. The FDIC may increase or decrease the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking. The FDIC’s current system represents a change, required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution’s volume of deposits.
 
In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the annualized FICO assessment was one basis point of total assets less tangible capital.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has exercised that discretion by establishing a long range fund of 2.0%.

The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Pilgrim Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
 
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.
 
Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. State non-member banks are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
Federal Reserve System. Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain noninterest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: for that portion of transaction accounts aggregating $89.0 million or less (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) the reserve requirement is 3.0% and the amounts greater than $89.0 million require a 10.0% reserve (which may be adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board between 8.0% and 14.0%). The first $15.5 million of otherwise reservable balances (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements. Pilgrim Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. Pilgrim Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, Pilgrim Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 31, 2017, Pilgrim Bank was in compliance with this requirement. Based on redemption provisions of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. Pilgrim Bank reviews for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston stock. As of December 31, 2017, no impairment has been recognized.
 
At its discretion, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston may declare dividends on its stock. The Federal Home Loan Banks are required to provide funds for certain purposes including the resolution of insolvent thrifts in the late 1980s and to contributing funds for affordable housing programs. These requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that the Federal Home Loan Banks pay to their members and result in the Federal Home Loan Banks imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members. The Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston has paid quarterly dividends in 2013 equal to an annual yield of 0.38%, in 2014 equal to an annual yield of 1.49%, in 2015 equal to an annual yield of 2.41%, in 2016 equal to an annual yield of 2.86%, and in 2017 equal to an annual yield of 2.86%. There can be no assurance that such dividends will continue in the future. Further, there can be no assurance that the impact of recent or future legislation on the Federal Home Loan Banks also will not cause a decrease in the value of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston stock held by Pilgrim Bank.

Holding Company Regulation
 
General. Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. As such, Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. is registered with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. and its non-bank subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary institution.
Permissible Activities. Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval also is required for Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire depository institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider, among other things, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institutions involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. In addition to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, prior approval may also be necessary from other agencies having supervisory jurisdiction over the bank to be acquired before any bank acquisition can be completed.
 
A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies. A bank holding company that meets certain criteria, such as being well-capitalized and well-managed within the meaning of applicable regulations, may elect to become a “financial holding company.” Such an election allows a bank holding company to engage in a broader array of financial activities, including insurance and investment banking.

Capital. When it reaches $1 billion in total assets, Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. will be subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s capital adequacy regulations for bank holding companies (on a consolidated basis). These capital standards have historically been similar to, though less stringent than, those of the FDIC for Pilgrim Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, required the Federal Reserve Board to establish, for all bank holding companies with total assets of $1 billion or more, minimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. Under regulations recently enacted by the Federal Reserve Board and effective January 1, 2015, all such bank holding companies are subject to regulatory capital requirements that are the same as the new capital requirements for Pilgrim Bank. These new capital requirements include provisions that, when applicable, might limit the ability of Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. to pay dividends to its stockholders or repurchase its shares. See “—Federal Banking Regulation—Capital Rule.”
Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the “source of strength” doctrine. The Federal Reserve Board has issued regulations requiring that all bank holding companies serve as a source of managerial and financial strength to their subsidiary banks by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.
Dividends. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate or earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary institution becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also states that a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the bank holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
Acquisition. Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a bank holding company. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in control of the company. A change in control definitively occurs upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition.
Massachusetts Holding Company Regulation. Under the Massachusetts banking laws, a company owning or controlling two or more banking institutions, including a co-operative bank, is regulated as a bank holding company. The term “company” is defined by the Massachusetts banking laws similarly to the definition of “company” under the Bank Holding Company Act. Each Massachusetts bank holding company: (i) must obtain the approval of the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation before engaging in certain transactions, such as the acquisition of more than 5% of the voting stock of another banking institution; (ii) must register and file reports with the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks; and (iii) is subject to examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks.

Federal Securities Laws
 
Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc.’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Emerging Growth Company Status
 
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), which was enacted in April 2012, has made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.0 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.” Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. qualifies as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act.
 
An “emerging growth company” may choose not to hold stockholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say-on-pay” votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation; however, Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. will also not be subject to the auditor attestation requirement or additional executive compensation disclosure so long as it remains a “smaller reporting company” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally less than $75 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. has elected to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company.
 
A company loses emerging growth company status on the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (iii) the date on which such company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which such company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally, at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates).

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will be required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. We are subject to further reporting and audit requirements under the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have implemented policies, procedures and systems designed to ensure compliance with these regulations.
 
TAXATION
 
Federal Taxation
 
General. Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. and Pilgrim Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. and Pilgrim Bank.
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. and Pilgrim Bank currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31st for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the percentage method of accounting for bad debt reserves by banks and savings institutions, effective for taxable years beginning after 1995. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will reduce the federal tax rate of the Corporation starting on January 1, 2018.
Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, referred to as “alternative minimum taxable income.” The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount. Net operating losses can, in general, offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. At December 31, 2017, Pilgrim Bank had no minimum tax credit carryforward.
Corporate Dividends. We may exclude from our income 100% of dividends received from Pilgrim Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
 
Audit of Tax Returns. Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc.’s and Pilgrim Bank’s federal income tax returns, including tax returns of Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc.’s predecessors, have not been audited in the most recent five-year period.
State Taxation
 
Massachusetts generally requires corporations engaged in a unitary business to calculate their income on a combined basis with corporations which are under common control. Accordingly, Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. and Pilgrim Bank currently file combined annual income tax returns.

38
--

 

A financial institution or business corporation is generally entitled to special tax treatment as a “security corporation” under Massachusetts law provided that: (a) its activities are limited to buying, selling, dealing in or holding securities on its own behalf and not as a broker; and (b) it has applied for, and received, classification as a “security corporation” by the Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. A security corporation that is not a bank holding company under the Internal Revenue Code must pay a tax equal to 1.32% of its gross income.
 
Pilgrim Bank, under current law, files a Massachusetts combined excise tax return with its affiliates who do not qualify as security corporations. During the 2017 tax year, Pilgrim Bank was subject to an annual Massachusetts tax at a rate of 9.0% of its net income, adjusted for certain items. Massachusetts net income is defined as gross income, other than 95% of dividends received in any taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 1999 from or on account of the ownership of any class of stock if the institution owns 15% or more of the voting stock of the institution paying the dividend, less the deductions, but not the credits allowable under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended and in effect for the taxable year. The dividends must meet the qualifications under Massachusetts law. Dividends paid to affiliates participating in a combined return will be 100% excluded to the extent paid from earnings and profits of a unitary business included in the Massachusetts combined return. Deductions with respect to the following items, however, shall not be allowed except as otherwise provided: (a) dividends received, except as otherwise provided; (b) losses sustained in other taxable years; (c) taxes on or measured by income, franchise taxes measured by net income, franchise taxes for the privilege of doing business and capital stock taxes imposed by any state; or (d) the deduction allowed by section 168(k) of the Code. 
 
Other applicable state taxes include generally applicable sales and use taxes plus real and personal property taxes. None of the state tax returns of Pilgrim Bank is currently under audit, nor have any of these tax returns been audited during the past five years.
 
As a Maryland business corporation, Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. is required to file annual returns and pay annual fees to the State of Maryland.
