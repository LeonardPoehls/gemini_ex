Item 1.  Business
Overview
 We are engaged in the development, integration and marketing of rugged mobile personal computer systems, or PCs. Our rugged tablet PCs are designed to withstand hazardous conditions, such as extreme temperatures, driving rain, repeated vibrations, dirt, dust and concussive shocks.  The intrinsically safe, ruggedized and reliable nature of our products facilitates the extension of traditional computing systems to a broader range of field personnel, including energy pipeline inspectors, public safety responders, warehouse workers and pharmaceutical scientists. Our tablets are fitted with a range of performance-matched accessories, including multiple docking solutions, wireless connectivity alternatives, global positioning system modules, biometric and smartcard options, as well as traditional peripherals, such as keyboards and cases.  Additionally, our most rugged tablets are waterproof for up to 30 minutes in water up to a depth of three feet, are impervious to drops from as high as seven feet, are readable in direct sunlight, can be mounted on vehicles and include LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity options for real-time data access.  Our end user customers include major telecommunications companies, leading heavy equipment manufacturers, oil and gas production companies, the military and first responders.
 Until 2014, we competed and derived our revenue through the sale of our iX104 tablets in a subset of the rugged PC market, given the larger size and ultra-rugged attributes of our iX104 tablets, which weighs approximately 5.4 pounds.  Since then, we have reduced our dependency upon the continued market acceptance of our iX104 systems by broadening the market for our products and increasing our opportunities for revenue growth.  We have broadened our product offering, through development and acquisition, to include multiple fully-rugged and rugged tablets that are lighter weight and less expensive than our iX104 line of products.  These new products have allowed us to compete in significantly larger segments of the rugged PC market.  In 2014, we introduced our first fully-rugged, lighter weight tablets, offering Android and Windows operating systems, and in 2015 we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Motion Computing, Inc. and its subsidiaries, which we refer to herein as Motion, more fully discussed below.  This acquisition expanded our product lines to include multiple additional rugged tablet products, and expanded our domestic and international customer base.  We believe these lighter and less expensive tablets are ideal for field service applications and significantly more mobile market opportunities, as compared to our iX104.
 Looking forward, our strategy is to build increased marketplace awareness of our product offerings, in an effort that we believe will enable us to increase our revenue and to expand our share of the markets addressed by those products.
 We believe we are positioned for future revenue growth in the markets in which we compete.  We have introduced a line of computers that, based upon third‑party certifications, surpasses the performance standards and specifications that have been the accepted measuring sticks for rugged tablet computers in today’s marketplace.
 Our key initiatives for future revenue growth include the following:
  
• | New product development—based on input from customer and key industry participants;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continued expansion of sales activities for the Motion line of products we acquired;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The expansion of sales activities in non-U.S. markets, particularly in Europe;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continued penetration into the Fortune 500/Global 2000 markets;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establishment of key relationships with new distributors; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expanded focus on military and public safety markets.
--+------------------------------------------------------


The timing of large orders, and the related shipping dates of the ordered products, creates variability in our reported revenues.  While we may experience some variability in our quarterly operating results as a consequence of the impact of large orders, our goal is to grow our year-over-year revenues.  Our revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, however, was approximately 22% lower than the prior year.
 We are a Delaware corporation and our common stock trades on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol “XPLR.”

Motion F5m/C5m
 The Motion F5m and Motion C5m are easily recognized by their iconic integrated handle design, which was introduced by Motion in 2008.  The Motion C5 was originally introduced in a white color for clinical applications.  Motion then followed up with a black version of the Motion C5, the Motion F5, for field applications.  The rugged tablets’ fifth generation Intel Core processors, including the highest performing Intel i7 vPro processor, provide the power to quickly move through computation-intensive applications, while increasing overall power efficiency for longer battery life.
  
The products have a 10.4” View Anywhere display that mimics the size of many standard forms for which input is made easy with both touch and digital pen interfaces.  An optional barcode scanner is integrated into the handle for easy push-button reads.  A high resolution digital camera and the “SnapWorks by Xplore” camera application make it easy to capture images, annotate those images with the pen, and share the data with other applications.  An optional UHF RFID scanner enables long range reads of RFID tags up to nine feet away.  And, the “EasyConnect” expansion module can be populated with a magstripe reader to accept payments in real-time at the point of service.
 The products are often used in large metropolitan areas where LTE networks are susceptible to traffic congestion that negatively impacts connectivity performance.  To overcome that challenge, the products were designed and certified to support the additional spectrum of AWS (Advanced Wireless Services), commonly marketed by some carriers as XLTE. 


Bobcat
 At 2.4 pounds, the Bobcat is a fully-rugged Windows tablet with comprehensive standardized interfaces, an array of options through its proprietary Xpansion Port and a lightweight design. The Bobcat operates Windows 8.1 or Windows 7 Pro operating systems and is certified fully-rugged, with a MIL-STD 810G certification and IP65 rating.  The Bobcat’s direct bonded IPS screen, 500 nits of luminance and an 800-to-1 contrast ratio provides for outdoor readability, and a 10-finger multi-touch screen provides users with ease-of-use and touch optimization. The Bobcat is used in a variety of industries, including manufacturing, warehousing and distribution, utilities, telecommunications and the military.

Sales
 Our direct customers primarily consist of distribution companies, such as large computer companies, specialized system integrators, software vendors, distributors and value-added resellers, and to a lesser extent the end-users.  For fiscal year 2017, approximately 93% of our total revenues were attributable to sales through our distribution and reseller channels, and approximately 7% of our total revenues were attributable to sales directly to end-users.  We currently have relationships with more than 120 distributors and direct resellers.  Our distributors and resellers generally have large sales organizations that, in turn, sell our products to entities that are the ultimate end-users.  In any given year, a single distributor may account for a significant portion of our revenue.  In fiscal year 2017, we had two resellers located in the United States, SHI International and Synnex Information Technologies Inc., who accounted for approximately 20% and 16% of our total revenue, respectively.
 As of March 31, 2017, we had a sales team of nineteen individuals that either have geographic responsibilities for direct and indirect sales opportunities or responsibilities for specific enterprise customers, without limitation by geography.  Our regional and international sales teams work closely with our distributors and resellers in defined regions.  Our enterprise sales team works on specific large accounts and industry verticals. Our distributors are currently selling our products into the public safety, utility, telecommunications, field service, warehousing logistics, transportation, oil and gas production, manufacturing, route delivery, military and homeland security markets.
 Our North American revenue was approximately 76% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2017, as compared to approximately 73% of total revenue in fiscal year 2016.  The significance of the North American revenue was primarily attributable to large volume orders from our large medical, military and telecommunications end-users located in the United States.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Product Marketing
 Our product marketing work starts with aligning our product development plans with the anticipated needs of our target customers.  We recognize that, as a smaller company, our key to success depends on our ability to provide better products than our larger competitors, and to be more responsive to our customers’ needs.  As such, our product innovations are grounded in combining emerging technologies with customer needs.  When embarking on the development of a new product or an upgrade of an existing one, we devote resources to engaging customers, distributors and industry experts in the design process.  We believe that this process, combined with our flexibility to make quick decisions with the support of our contract manufacturers, has enabled us to deliver products with market leading technology ahead of our competitors.
 The market prices for rugged computers are higher than that for commercial grade computers used in traditional office settings.  However, we believe that the total cost of ownership of a rugged computer over a three to five-year period can be significantly lower than the cost of a cheaper non-rugged computer in certain environments.  Several of our customers have disclosed to us in our customer‑based market research studies that they experienced higher direct costs using non-rugged devices, with more frequent damage, information retrieval costs and replacement costs, as well as higher indirect costs, such as prolonged downtime.  This conclusion is also supported by third-party research.
 
Market Segments
 We target a number of different market segments in which we believe the deployment of rugged mobile computers can greatly improve operating efficiencies, reduce related costs, and improve customer service levels.
 Telecommunications, Utilities & Energy.  Generally, telecom, utility and energy related companies continuously have to respond to customers’ requests for service and infrastructure maintenance expeditiously and efficiently to remain competitive.  We believe that the reliable and real-time movement of information to and from the field is vital to the success of any field automation system.  To fully leverage the value of mobile computing in these environments, they must also be safe to use in hazardous environments where explosive gases may be present – particularly relevant to the oil and gas industry.  We have responded with products that are compliant with C1D2 and ATEX standards for use in these environments.  Two global top ten telecommunications providers in the world are end-users of our products, as well as several of the world’s largest utility and energy companies, including Hydro One in Canada, EDF in France, RWE in Germany, Sydney Water in Australia, and Thames Water in the United Kingdom.
 Military.  As the military continues to transition to commercial and industrial grade rugged mobile computing systems, we expect this market segment will represent a significant opportunity for our products.  In particular, we believe the U.S. Department of Defense is generally moving away from full military specifications adherence, except for system‑critical operations, and instead is increasing emphasis on purchasing commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment.  The military market sector includes ground and C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence) systems.  We have deployed solutions across the Army, Air Force, and Navy in the U. S., as well as military operations in other countries.

Public Safety. Given the focus in the U.S. on homeland security matters and the continued commitment by Federal, state and municipal governments on law enforcement, fire and emergency medical services, members of the public safety sector are searching for efficiencies that will better enable them to do their jobs.  Rugged mobile computing devices assist these groups in a variety of ways.  For example, having a reliable and durable tablet PC provides law enforcement agencies with immediate and reliable access in the field to national and local criminal databases.  In this market segment, our products have been sold to hundreds of public safety organizations across the world, including the Abu Dhabi Police, Danish Ambulance Service, and the German Red Cross.
 Manufacturing.  Manufacturing floor environments demand resiliency and mobility, and require more rugged computing power than ever before, to store large amounts of data and display complex and highly detailed drawings.  Whether assembly, maintenance, or repair operations are confined to an indoor factory, an enclosed hangar, or an outdoor testing facility, the environmental elements and vibrations from equipment and forklifts can be harmful to the average laptop, desktop, or mobile PC.  Our rugged tablet IP ratings and the results of extensive MIL-STD-810G tests are particularly relevant to this segment.  We have experienced particular success in the Automotive and Aerospace sectors of this market segment, with customers that include Boeing, Bombardier in Canada, Embraer in Brazil, Dassault Aviation in France, Audi in Germany, and Volkswagen in Italy.
 Transportation and Distribution.  We believe that globalization, increased competition and heightened consumer expectations are contributing factors to the adoption of mobile computing technologies by many leading transportation and distribution companies.  That means mobilizing highly complex and integrated logistical tasks in a way that is simple and straightforward, whether on planes, trains, forklifts or tractor-trailers.  These operations typically require real time price modifications, product introductions and transitions, timely inventory management, load balancing and scheduling.  We believe that this market segment will continue to automate order fulfillment, inventory control and management systems as part of an overall effort to integrate enterprise resource planning and supply chain management information systems.  Our end-users include leading railroad, trucking and airline companies, package delivery companies, as well as the warehouse operations of large automotive manufacturing and food processing plants.  We have a diverse set of customers in this segment, including Norfolk Southern, CSX, UPS, and Hertz.
Research and Development
 We have assembled an experienced engineering and product development team.  Through the collaboration of our employees and the engineering teams of our Taiwan-based contract manufacturers, we believe we are able to bring significant resources to the research, development and design of our products.
 We seek to design and manage product life cycles through a controlled and structured process.  We involve customers and industry experts from our target markets in the definition and refinement of our product development.  Product development emphasis is placed on meeting industry standards and product specifications, ease of integration, ease of use, cost reduction, design-for manufacturability, quality and reliability. 
 We continue to invest in research and development to enhance and expand our rugged mobile computing systems.  We are considering additional form factors, operating systems and screen technologies for integration into our rugged platforms as we seek to expand into additional markets.  During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we expended $4,462,000 and $5,771,000, respectively, on research and development activities, none of which was borne by our customers.

Competition
 Competition in our industry is intense and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and rapid changes in customer requirements.  To be competitive, we must continue to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products and product features that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards, and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our end users.  We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products are the product’s performance, features and reliability, price, customer service, reputation in the industry and brand loyalty.  We believe that our strongest competitive advantages are our products’ durability and reputation in the industry.  In order to compete, we will be required to continue to respond promptly and effectively to the challenges of technological changes and our competitors’ innovations.
 Our primary competitors in the mobile rugged computer market include the following:

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Panasonic and Getac have more product offerings and greater financial, technical, and research and development resources and marketing capabilities than we do.  DRS produces tablets with specific connectivity required by the U.S. Military.
 We also face competition from manufacturers of non-rugged mobile computers, such as Samsung, Inc., Dell, Inc., Hewlett‑Packard Company, Apple, Inc., Sony and Toshiba, to the extent customers decide to purchase less expensive traditional computers for use in environments that we believe are better suited for mobile rugged computers.
 
Manufacturing
 
We have a scalable manufacturing infrastructure to support our growing business.  Our primary contract manufacturers, Wistron Corporation (Wistron), Pegatron Corporation (Pegatron) and Ubiqconn Technology, Inc. (Ubiqconn), are located in Taiwan.  Wistron is the supplier of our iX104 and XSLATE B10 products.  Wistron is recognized as a leading provider of computers and electronic components to some of the world’s largest technology companies, including Dell, Inc. and Hewlett‑Packard Company.  Pegatron is the supplier of our XSLATE R12, F5/C5 and CL920 products.  Pegatron, is also a leading provider of computers and electronic components to the world’s largest technology companies.  Ubiqconn is the supplier of our XSLATE D10 and Bobcat products.  Ubiqconn was spun off from the First International Computer (FIC) Group in 2011 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FIC.  FIC has been a dominant force in the technology research, product development and manufacturing services since 1980.  Ubiqconn is comprised of FIC’s Industrial Computer Business Unit and FIC’s original research and development team, which has accumulated over twenty years of experience in developing IT products for worldwide first tier companies.  We expect our relationships with our contract manufacturers will support our expected sales growth and product demand for the foreseeable future.
 We outsource the majority of our manufacturing services for our rugged mobile PC tablets to our contract manufacturers, including board production, parts procurement, assembly, some quality assurance testing, warranty repair and service.  We have design and manufacturing agreements with our contract manufacturers and they collaborate with us on product specifications and provide us with the flexibility to make changes to our products as market conditions change.

Under the terms of our agreements with our contract manufacturers, they provide us with design, manufacturing and support services related to our rugged mobile PC tablets.  The purchase price of our products is determined based on the specific configuration of the tablet PC being produced, and is subject to cost reduction plans and volume based discounts.  At least quarterly, we meet with each of the contract manufacturers to develop cost reduction plans.  The plans take into account alternative suppliers along with components, design, process changes and other cost savings procedures.  Each month we provide the contract manufacturers with a six month rolling forecast of the products we anticipate ordering.  Generally, each of the contract manufacturers have approximately 90 days after its acceptance of our purchase order to ship the product.  If products ordered during any quarter exceed the volume projected in the forecast, each of the contract manufacturers has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to deliver the excess products within 45 days after its acceptance of the applicable purchase order.
 Our contract manufacturers provide several warranties to us, including that they have all necessary rights required to sell the products, that each product will be free from any material defect, that the products will be free from any liens, encumbrances or defects in title and that the products will comply with all specifications.  The current terms of our agreements with the contract manufacturers are for one year and automatically renew for additional one year terms, unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 90 days prior to the expiration of any renewal term.  In addition, the agreements contain provisions that allow for termination for any reason by either party upon 120 days’ notice.
 We purchase materials, supplies and product subassemblies for our rugged mobile personal computer tablets from a number of vendors.  Some key components included in our line of products are currently available only from single or limited sources.  In the past, we have experienced significant price increases and limited availability of certain components that are not available from multiple sources.  We are dependent upon Microsoft Corporation for various software products, including products included in our rugged mobile PC tablets.
 Like other participants in the computer manufacturing industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our requirements for periods averaging 90 to 150 days.  At times, we have been constrained by parts availability in meeting our product orders.  From time to time, we have obtained scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market, which may have a negative impact on our gross margins on our products, but does not disrupt production.  On occasion, we have also acquired component inventory from our suppliers in anticipation of supply constraints.
 
Intellectual Property
 Our performance and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degree on our proprietary technology.  We rely primarily upon a combination of patent, copyright and trade secret laws and license agreements to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products and technology.  On March 31, 2017, we had thirty-eight U.S. patents and thirteen non-US patents.  In addition, we had one U.S. patent application, one Chinese patent application, one European Union patent application and one Taiwanese patent application, all related to proprietary elements of our tablet products, and one U.S. patent application, one Taiwanese patent application and one International PCT patent application related to our wireless dock.  Of these patents a total of thirty-two US patents and thirteen non-U.S. patents were acquired in the Motion Acquisition.  Even with patent protection, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without our authorization, or to develop similar technology independently.  In addition, effective patent, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries.
 We do not believe that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of any third parties.  There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not claim such infringement by us or our licensees with respect to current or future products.  In the past, we have had third parties assert exclusive patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights to technologies or marks that are important to our business.  Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the claimant, any of which could delay the development and commercialization of our products or increase the costs of our products.  After the Motion Acquisition, three companies filed lawsuits against us and Motion for alleged infringement of the claimant’s patent by Motion’s products and our products.  We have settled two of the lawsuits by entering into license agreements, with a modest one-time payment.  We have no potential liability with the third claimant because we had, and continue to have, an existing license agreement with that company.
