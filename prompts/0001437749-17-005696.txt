ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview and Recent Developments
 
We are Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc., a Marshall Islands corporation incorporated on March 23, 2005 and headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. We own one of the largest fleets of Supramax/Ultramax dry bulk vessels in the world. Supramax dry bulk are vessels which are constructed with on-board cranes, ranging in size from approximately 50,000 to 59,000 “dwt” and Ultramax dry bulk vessels range in size from 60,000 to 65,000 dwt. They are considered a sub-category of the Handymax segment; typically defined as 40,000 to 65,000 dwt. We transport a broad range of major and minor bulk cargoes, including but not limited to coal, grain, ore, petcoke, cement and fertilizer, along worldwide shipping routes. As of December 31, 2016, we owned and operated a modern fleet of 41 Handymax dry bulk vessels. We chartered-in a 37,000 dwt newbuilding Japanese vessel that was delivered in October 2014 for seven years with an option for one additional year.
 
We are focused on maintaining a high quality fleet that is concentrated primarily in Supramax/Ultramax dry bulk carriers. These vessels have the cargo loading and unloading flexibility of on-board cranes while offering cargo carrying capacities approaching that of Panamax dry bulk vessels, which range in size from 72,000 to 83,000 dwt and rely on port facilities to load and offload their cargoes. We believe that the cargo handling flexibility and cargo carrying capacity of the Supramax/Ultramax class vessels make them attractive to cargo interests and vessel charterers. The 41 vessels in our operating fleet, with an aggregate carrying capacity of 2,260,943 dwt, have an average age of 8.7 years as of December 31, 2016.
 
We carry out the commercial and strategic management of our fleet through our indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary, Eagle Shipping International (USA) LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company which maintains its principal executive offices in Stamford, Connecticut. We own each of our vessels through a separate wholly-owned Marshall Islands limited liability company. 
 
Corporate Reorganization and Refinancing
 
On March 30, 2016, we entered into the Contribution Agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) with a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary, Eagle Shipping LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the Marshall Islands (“Eagle Shipping”) pursuant to which the Company transferred, assigned and contributed to Eagle Shipping, and Eagle Shipping received, accepted and assumed, all of the tangible and intangible assets of the Company other than the membership interests in Eagle Shipping owned by the Company and certain deposit accounts held by the Company, which deposit account balances were transferred and all of the liabilities of the Company, including all of the Company’s rights and obligations under the Exit Financing Facility (as defined below) (the “Contribution”). Immediately following the Contribution, Eagle Shipping became the direct parent company of each of the Company’s previously directly-owned subsidiaries and the indirect parent company of each of the Company’s previously indirectly-owned subsidiaries. The Contribution was part of a series of transactions contemplated by the agreements also entered into on March 30, 2016 and described below, which transactions were consummated on March 30, 2016, after the fulfillment of certain conditions precedent. See “Note 2. Corporate Reorganization” to the consolidated financial statements.
New Office, New Subsidiary and Vessel Acquisitions
 
On June 20, 2016, the Company announced the expansion of its global commercial presence with the establishment of a new office in Hamburg, Germany, and which is operated through a new subsidiary, Eagle Bulk Europe GmbH, which commenced operations in August 2016.
  On September 30, 2016, a newly formed subsidiary, Eagle Bulk Shipco LLC (“Eagle Shipco”), signed a memorandum of agreement to acquire a 2016 Nantong COSCO Kawasaki Heavy Industries Engineering Co Ltd (“NACKS”) built Ultramax 61,000 dwt vessel for $18.85 million. The Company took delivery of the vessel in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
 
On November 14, 2016, Eagle Shipco, signed a memorandum of agreement to acquire a 2017 built 64,000 dwt SDARI-64 Ultramax dry bulk vessel constructed at Chengxi Shipyard Co., Ltd for $17.9 million. The Company took the delivery of the vessel in the first quarter of 2017.
 
On February 28, 2017, Eagle Bulk Ultraco LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Eagle Ultraco”), entered into a framework agreement (the “Greenship Agreement”) with Greenship Bulk Manager Pte. Ltd., as Trustee-Manager of Greenship Bulk Trust, a Norwegian OTC-listed entity (the “Greenship Sellers”), for the purchase of nine modern sister vessels built between 2012 and 2015 (each a “Greenship Vessel,” and collectively, the “Greenship Vessels”). Of the nine Greenship Vessels, three Greenship Vessels were subject to certain customary conditions as well as the approval of the requisite majority of the unitholders of the Greenship Sellers which approval was obtained. The aggregate purchase price for the nine Greenship Vessels is $153.0 million. The allocated purchase price for each Greenship Vessel is $17.0 million. The Greenship Vessels are expected to be delivered charter free between April and September 2017. See “Note 20. Subsequent Events” to the consolidated financial statements.

Management of Our Fleet
 
Our Connecticut-based management team primarily focuses on the sub-Panamax dry bulk sectors, such as Supramax, Ultramax, Handymax and Handysize vessels, undertakes all commercial and strategic management of our fleet. We have established in-house technical management capabilities, through which we provide technical management services to all of our vessels. On August 24, 2015, the Company provided its three months’ notice to V. Ships Limited to terminate the technical management contract between the companies. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company completed the process of transferring the vessels to our in-house technical management.
Our Competitive Strengths and our Business Strategy
  
We believe that we have a number of strengths that provide us with a competitive advantage in the dry bulk shipping industry, including:
 

● | A large and homogeneous fleet of Supramax/Ultramax dry bulk vessels. We own and operate one of the largest Supramax/Ultramax fleets in the world. As of December 31, 2016, our owned-fleet totaled 41 vessels, supplemented by chartered in vessels. We view Handymax vessels, especially the Supramax class of vessels, as an attractive sector of the dry bulk shipping industry relative to larger vessel sectors due to their:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Increased operating flexibility; 
--+--------------------------------------------------
o | Ability to access more ports; and 
o | Ability to carry a more diverse range of cargoes.


● | A modern, high quality fleet. The 41 Handymax vessels in our operating fleet as of December 31, 2016 had an average age of approximately 8.7 years. In 2011, we completed our Supramax vessel newbuilding program, pursuant to which we took delivery of 27 Supramax newbuilding vessels from 2008 to 2011. We believe that owning a modern, high quality fleet reduces operating costs, improves safety and provides us with a competitive advantage in securing employment for our vessels. Our fleet was built to high standards and all of our vessels were built at leading Japanese and Chinese shipyards, including Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding Co., Ltd., and Oshima Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. The newbuilding vessels were built at shipyards including IHI Marine United, Japan and Yangzhou Dayang Shipbuilding Co. Ltd, China. On September 30, 2016, the Company, through its subsidiary, Eagle Shipco, signed a memorandum of agreement to acquire a 2016 NACKS built Ultramax 61,530 dwt vessel for $18.85 million. The Company took delivery of the vessel in the fourth quarter of 2016. On November 14, 2016, the Company through Eagle Shipco, signed a memorandum of agreement to acquire a 2017 built 64,000 dwt SDARI-64 Ultramax dry bulk vessel constructed at Chengxi Shipyard Co., Ltd for $17.9 million. The Company took delivery of the vessel in the first quarter of 2017. On February 28, 2017, Eagle Ultraco entered into the Greenship Agreement for the purchase of nine modern sister vessels built between 2012 and 2015 for an aggregate purchase price of $153.0 million, subject to certain conditions. See “Note 20. Subsequent Events” to the consolidated financial statements.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A fleet of sister and similar ships allows us to maintain low cost, and highly efficient operations. Our current operating fleet of 41 vessels includes eight identical sister ships built at the Mitsui shipyard based on the same design specifications, two sets of five and 17 identical sister ships built at Dayang shipyard, five identical sister ships built at IHI Marine United shipyard, and three similar ships built at the Oshima shipyard that use many of the same parts and equipment. Furthermore, the recently announced Greenship Agreement for the purchase of nine Crown-63 vessels are of identical specification, and these vessels were all built by Sinopacific Shipbuilding Group at the Dayang Shipyard, and Zhejiang Shipyards. In addition to the owned fleet, we charter-in a 37,000 dwt new built Japanese vessel which delivered to the Company as a new building in 2014 and has charter expiry in 2021. Operating sister and similar ships provides us with operational and scheduling flexibility, efficiencies in employee training and lower inventory and maintenance expenses. We believe that this should allow us both to increase revenue and lower operating costs. We intend to actively monitor and control vessel operating expenses while maintaining the high quality of our fleet through regular inspection and maintenance programs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Balanced charter program. The Company’s chartering strategy has historically been to time charter the vessels on short- to medium-term charters, often with vessel operators. However, under its new management team, the Company transitioned to an active operating model where it is entering into a higher percentage of voyage charters and developing contractual relationships directly with cargo interests. In 2016, 35% of the charters were on a voyage basis, as compared to 6% in 2015. Voyage charters and contracts as well as the relationships with actual users (shippers, receivers and traders) have what we believe to be the dual benefit of providing greater operational efficiencies and can act as a balance to the Company’s naturally long position to the market. Notwithstanding the focus on voyage chartering, the Company consistently monitors the dry bulk shipping market and, based on market conditions, will consider taking advantage of long-term time charters at higher rates when appropriate.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand our fleet through selective acquisitions of dry bulk vessels. Depending on market conditions, we intend to acquire additional modern, high-quality vessels through timely and selective acquisitions in a manner that is accretive to our cash flows. We expect to focus primarily in the Supramax and Ultramax classes within the Handymax sector of the dry bulk shipping industry. While not a priority, we may also consider acquisitions of other sizes of dry bulk vessels.

Nature of Business
      As mentioned above, the Company’s chartering strategy has historically been to time charter the vessels on short-to medium-term charter, often with vessel operators. However, under its new management team, the Company is in the midst of a transition to an active operating model where it is entering into a higher percentage of voyage charters and developing contractual relationships directly with cargo interests. These relationships and the related cargo contracts have what we believe to be the dual benefit of providing greater operational efficiencies and act as a balance to the Company’s naturally long position to the market. Notwithstanding the focus on voyage chartering, the Company consistently monitors the dry bulk shipping market and, based on market conditions, will consider taking advantage of long-term time charters at higher rates when appropriate.

(1) | “Hire rate” refers to a sum of money paid to the vessel owner by a charterer under a time charter party for the use of a vessel. “BSI” refers to “Baltic Supramax Index” and the daily hire rate varies based on the Index. The BSI is an index published by the Baltic Exchange which tracks the gross time charter value for a specific 52,000 dwt vessel.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | “Voyage expenses” includes fuel, port charges, canal tolls, cargo handling operations and brokerage commissions paid by the Company.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | “Vessel expenses” includes crewing, repairs and maintenance, insurance, stores, lubes, communication expenses.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | “Off-hire” refers to the time a vessel is unavailable for performing the service either due to scheduled or unscheduled repairs.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The following summary represents the number of our fleet of vessels performing the various types of employments as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
 

 | December 31, 2016 | December 31, 2015 | December 31, 2014

Index Charter | - | - | 4 
Commercial Pool | 1 | 1 | 12 
Unemployed/ Drydock | 1 | 3 | 2 
 | 42 | 45 | 45 

 

We have established our own in-house technical management capability, through which we provide technical management services to all of our vessels. During the first quarter of 2016, we completed the transfer of all vessels to in-house technical management.
 
In connection with the charters of each of our vessels, we pay commissions ranging from 1.25% to 5.00% of the total daily charter hire rate of each charter to unaffiliated ship brokers and to in-house ship brokers associated with the charterers, depending on the number of brokers involved with arranging the relevant charter.
 
Our vessels operate worldwide within the trading limits imposed by insurance terms and do not operate in countries or territories that are subject to United States, EU or United Nations (the “UN”) comprehensive country-wide or territory-wide sanctions.

Our Customers
 
Our customers include international companies such as SK Shipping, Mur Shipping, Oldendorff Carriers GmbH, Cargill International S.A. Hyundai Merchant Marine Co Ltd, and Arcelo Mittal Sourcing SCA. Our assessment of customers’ financial condition and reliability is an important factor in negotiating employment for our vessels. We aim to charter our vessels to major trading houses (including commodities traders), publicly traded companies, reputable vessel owners and operators, major producers and government-owned entities rather than to more speculative or undercapitalized entities. We evaluate the counterparty risk of potential customers based on our management's experience in the shipping industry combined with the additional input of two independent credit risk consultants. In 2016, we did not have any customer who accounted for more than 10% of our time and voyage charter revenue. In 2015, the Navig8 pool (the “Navig8 Pool”) accounted for approximately 17.2% of our time and voyage charter revenue. In 2014, for the period January 1 to October 15, one customer and the Navig8 Pool individually accounted for approximately 10.5% and 17.7% of our time and voyage charter revenue, respectively. For the period October 16, 2014 to December 31, 2014, the Navig8 Pool accounted for 27.7% of our time and voyage charter revenue. 
Operations
 
There are two central aspects to the operation of our fleet:
 

● | Commercial operations, which involve chartering and operating a vessel; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Technical operations, which involve maintaining, crewing and insuring a vessel.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We carry out the commercial and strategic management of our fleet through our indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries, Eagle Shipping International (USA) LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company that was formed in January 2005 and maintains its principal executive offices in Stamford, Connecticut, and Eagle Bulk Pte. Ltd, a Singapore company. On June 20, 2016, the Company announced the expansion of its global commercial presence with the establishment of a new office in Hamburg, Germany. A new subsidiary, Eagle Bulk Europe GmbH, commenced its operations in the Hamburg office in August 2016. Our office staff, either directly or through these subsidiaries, provides the following services:
 

● | Commercial operations and technical supervision;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | Safety monitoring;
--+-------------------


● | Vessel acquisition; and
--+------------------------


● | Financial accounting and information technology services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 
We currently have an aggregate of approximately 75 shore-based personnel in our principal executive office in Stamford, Connecticut, as well as our offices in Hamburg, Germany and Singapore.
 
Each of the Company’s vessels serve the same type of customer, have similar operation and maintenance requirements, operate in the same regulatory environment, and are subject to similar economic characteristics.  Based on this, the Company has determined that it operates in one reportable segment which is engaged in the ocean transportation of dry bulk cargoes worldwide through the ownership and operation of dry bulk carrier vessels. The Company’s vessels regularly move between countries in international waters, over hundreds of trade routes and, as a result, the disclosure of geographic information is impracticable.
 
Commercial and Strategic Management
  
We perform all of the commercial and strategic management of our fleet including obtaining employment for our vessels and maintaining relationships with the charterers of our vessels. In order to increase our market coverage, we opened a commercial office in Hamburg, Germany in August 2016. Now, we have three offices across the globe including Singapore and Stamford and we effectively have twenty four hour global market coverage. We believe that because of our management team’s experience in operating dry bulk vessels, we have access to a broad range of charterers and can employ our fleet efficiently in any diverse market conditions and achieve high utilization rates.

Being an active owner-operator means effectively seeking to operate our own vessels when possible, as compared with time chartering them to other operators, all with a view toward achieving higher than market net time charter equivalent (“TCE”). In doing so, we believe we can take advantage of rapidly changing market information and obtain better operational efficiencies from our fleet. In addition, we constantly look to arbitrage cargo and vessels positions by taking in additional vessels on time charter, and/or reletting cargo commitments on voyage basis. We also constantly monitor the dry bulk shipping market, and opportunistically time-charter charter vessels in for a period of time, where we typically obtain some optionality on the duration of the period. We also buy and sell freight forward agreements (“FFAs”) contracts to hedge exposure of physical commitments in order to mitigate market risk.

Under a voyage charter, the owner of a vessel provides the vessel for the transport of goods between specific ports in return for the payment of an agreed-upon freight per ton of cargo or, alternatively, a specified total amount. All operating costs, including fuel costs and port charges are borne by the owner of the vessel. A single voyage charter is often referred to as a “spot charter,” which generally lasts from two to ten weeks. Operating vessels in the spot market may afford greater opportunity to capitalize on fluctuations in the spot market; when vessel demand is high we earn higher rates, but when demand is low our rates are lower and potentially insufficient to cover costs. Spot market rates are volatile and are affected by world economics, international events, weather conditions, strikes, governmental policies, supply and demand, and other factors beyond our control. If the markets are especially weak for protracted periods, there is a risk that vessels in the spot market may spend time idle waiting for business, or in extreme cases may even have to be "laid up".
 

● | Identifying, purchasing, and selling vessels. We believe that our commercial management team has longstanding relationships in the dry bulk industry, which provides us access to an extensive network of ship brokers and vessel owners that we believe will provide us with an advantage in future transactions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Obtaining insurance coverage for our vessels. We have well-established relationships with reputable marine underwriters in all the major insurance markets around the world that helps insure our fleet at competitive rates.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technical Management

We have established in-house technical management capabilities, through which we provide technical management services to all of our vessels. On August 24, 2015, we provided three months’ notice to V. Ships Limited to terminate the technical management contract,and, during the first quarter of 2016, we completed the transfer of all the vessels to in-house technical management.
 
Technical management includes managing day-to-day vessel operations, performing general vessel maintenance, ensuring regulatory and classification society compliance, supervising the maintenance and general efficiency of vessels, arranging the hire of qualified officers and crew, arranging and supervising drydocking and repairs, purchasing supplies, spare parts, lubricants, and new equipment for vessels, appointing supervisors and technical consultants and providing technical support.
 
We currently crew our vessels primarily with officers and seamen from Ukraine, Russia, Myanmar (formerly Burma), and Eastern European countries who are hired through our third party crew managers. As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 820 officers and seamen on the 41 vessels in our operating fleet. Each crew manager handles each seaman's training, travel, and payroll and is obligated to assure that all our seamen have the qualifications and licenses required to comply with current international regulations and shipping conventions. Additionally, our seafaring employees perform most operational and maintenance work and assist in supervising work during cargo operations and at drydock facilities. We typically man our vessels with more crew members than are required by the country of the vessel's flag safe manning certification in order to allow for the performance of routine maintenance duties. All of our crew members are subject to and are paid commensurate with international collective bargaining agreements and, therefore, we do not anticipate any labor disruptions. All international collective bargaining agreements to which we are a party are renewed for two years, prior to their expiry.
  
Permits, Authorizations and Regulations
 
We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our vessels. The kinds of permits, licenses and certificates required depend upon several factors, including the commodity transported, the waters in which the vessel operates, the nationality of the vessel's crew and the age of a vessel. We expect to be able to obtain all permits, licenses and certificates currently required to permit our vessels to operate. Additional laws and regulations, environmental or otherwise, may be adopted which could limit our ability to do business or increase the cost of us doing business.
 
Our vessels operate worldwide within the trading limits imposed by our insurance terms and do not operate in countries or territories that are subject to United States, EU or UN comprehensive country-wide or territory wide sanctions. 
 
In November 2015, the Company filed a voluntary self-disclosure report with OFAC regarding certain apparent violations of U.S. sanctions regulations in the provision of shipping services for third party charterers with respect to the transportation of cargo to or from Myanmar (formerly Burma). At the time of such apparent violations, the Company had a different senior operational management team. Notwithstanding the fact that the apparent violations took place under a different senior operational management team and although the Company’s new board and management have implemented robust remedial measures and significantly enhanced its compliance safeguards there can be no assurance that OFAC will not conclude that these past actions warrant the imposition of civil penalties and/or referral for further investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice. The report was provided to OFAC for the agency’s review, consideration and determination regarding what action, if any, may be taken in resolution of this matter. The Company will continue to cooperate with the agency regarding this matter and cannot estimate when such review will be concluded. While the ultimate impact of these matters cannot be determined, there can be no assurance that the impact will not be material to the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. See “Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies – Legal Proceedings” to the consolidated financial statements.

Environmental and Other Regulations
 
Government regulation significantly affects the ownership and operation of our vessels. We are subject to international conventions and treaties, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the countries in which our vessels may operate or are registered relating to safety and health and environmental protection including the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of hazardous and non-hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination and liability for damage to natural resources. Compliance with such laws, regulations and other requirements entails significant expense, including vessel modifications and implementation of certain operating procedures. 
 
A variety of government and private entities subject our vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections. These entities include the local port authorities (United States Coast Guard, (the “USCG”) harbor master or equivalent), classification societies; flag state administrations (country of registry) and charterers, particularly terminal operators. Certain of these entities require us to obtain permits, licenses and certificates for the operation of our vessels. Failure to maintain necessary permits or approvals could require us to incur substantial costs or temporarily suspend the operation of one or more of our vessels.
 
We believe that the heightened level of environmental and quality concerns among insurance underwriters, regulators and charterers is leading to greater inspection and safety requirements on all vessels and may accelerate the scrapping of older vessels throughout the dry bulk shipping industry. Increasing environmental concerns have created a demand for vessels that conform to the stricter environmental standards. We are required to maintain operating standards for all of our vessels that emphasize operational safety, quality maintenance, continuous training of our officers and crews and compliance with United States and international regulations. We believe that the operation of our vessels is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that our vessels have all material permits, licenses, certificates or other authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations. However, because such laws and regulations are frequently changed and may impose increasingly stricter requirements, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these requirements, or the impact of these requirements on the resale value or useful lives of our vessels.  In addition, a future serious marine incident, such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, that causes significant adverse environmental impact could result in additional legislation or regulation that could negatively affect our profitability.
 
International Maritime Organization
 
The UN’s International Maritime Organization (the “IMO”) has adopted several international conventions, including the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (collectively referred to as MARPOL 73/78 and herein as “MARPOL”).  MARPOL entered into force on October 2, 1983.  It has been adopted by over 150 nations, including many of the jurisdictions in which our vessels operate.  MARPOL sets forth pollution-prevention requirements applicable to dry bulk carriers, among other vessels, and is broken into six Annexes, each of which regulates a different source of pollution.  Annex I relates to oil leakage or spilling; Annexes II and III relate to harmful substances carried, in bulk, in liquid or packaged form, respectively; Annexes IV and V relate to sewage and garbage management, respectively; and Annex VI, lastly, relates to air emissions.  Annex VI was separately adopted by the IMO in September of 1997, and relates to air emissions.
 
In 2012, the IMO’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee (“MEPC”) adopted by resolution amendments to the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk (the “IBC Code”). The provisions of the IBC Code are mandatory under MARPOL and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, (the “SOLAS”). These amendments, which entered into force in June 2014, pertain to revised international certificates of fitness for the carriage of dangerous chemicals in bulk and identifying new products that fall under the IBC Code. We may need to make certain financial expenditures to comply with these amendments.
 
In 2013, the MEPC adopted by resolution amendments to the MARPOL Annex I Conditional Assessment Scheme, or CAS. The amendments, which became effective on October 1, 2014, pertain to revising references to the inspections of bulk carriers and tankers after the 2011 ESP Code, which enhances the programs of inspections, became mandatory. We may need to make certain financial expenditures to comply with these amendments.

Air Emissions
 
In September of 1997, the IMO adopted Annex VI to MARPOL to address air pollution (“Annex VI”).  Effective May 2005, Annex VI sets limits on nitrogen oxide emissions from ships whose diesel engines were constructed (or underwent major conversions) on or after January 1, 2000.  It also prohibits “deliberate emissions” of “ozone depleting substances,” defined to include certain halons and chlorofluorocarbons.  “Deliberate emissions” are not limited to times when the ship is at sea; they can for example include discharges occurring in the course of the ship’s repair and maintenance.  Emissions of “volatile organic compounds” from certain tankers, and the shipboard incineration (from incinerators installed after January 1, 2000) of certain substances (such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)) are also prohibited.  Annex VI also includes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for special areas to be established with more stringent controls of sulfur emissions known as “Emission Control Areas” (“ECAs”) (see below).
 
MEPC, adopted amendments to Annex VI on October 10, 2008, which entered into force on July 1, 2010.  The amended Annex VI seeks to further reduce air pollution by, among other things, implementing a progressive reduction of the amount of sulfur contained in any fuel oil used on board ships.  As of January 1, 2012, the amended Annex VI requires that fuel oil contain no more than 3.50% sulfur.  By January 1, 2020, sulfur content must not exceed 0.50%, subject to a feasibility review to be completed no later than 2018. On October 27, 2016, following a feasibility review, the IMO announced it will implement the global sulfur cap. By January 1, 2020, the sulfur content of fuel must not exceed 0.50%.
 
Sulfur content standards are even stricter within certain ECAs.  As of July 1, 2010, ships operating within an ECA may not use fuel with sulfur content in excess of 1.0% which was further reduced to 0.10% on January 1, 2015.  Amended Annex VI establishes procedures for designating new ECAs.  Currently, the Baltic Sea the North Sea and certain coastal areas of North America have been designated as ECAs. Furthermore as of January 1, 2014 the applicable areas of the United States and the Caribbean Sea were designated as ECAs.  Ocean-going vessels in these areas will be subject to stringent emissions controls and may cause us to incur additional costs. If other ECAs are approved by the IMO or other new or more stringent requirements relating to emissions from marine diesel engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), or the states where we operate, compliance with these regulations could entail significant capital expenditures, operational changes, or otherwise increase the costs of our operations.
   
Amended Annex VI also establishes new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for new marine engines, depending on their date of installation.  The EPA promulgated equivalent (and in some senses stricter) emissions standards in late 2009.
 
As of January 1, 2010, the Directive 2005/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 6, 2005, amending Directive 1999/32/EC, came into force. The objective of the directive is to reduce emission of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter caused by the combustion of certain petroleum derived fuels. The directive imposes limits on the sulfur content of such fuels as a condition of their use within a Member State territory. The maximum sulfur content for marine fuels used by inland waterway vessels and ships at berth in ports in EU countries after January 1, 2010, is 0.10% by mass. As of January 1, 2015, all vessels operating within ECAs worldwide must comply with 0.1% sulfur requirements. Currently, the only grade of fuel meeting 0.1% sulfur content requirements is low Sulfur marine gas oil. On July 15, 2011, the European Commission also adopted a proposal for an amendment of Directive 1999/32/EC which would align requirements with those imposed by the revised MARPOL Annex VI which introduced stricter sulfur limits.
 
Safety Management System Requirements

The IMO also adopted SOLAS, and the International Convention on Load Lines,( the “LL Convention”), which impose a variety of standards that regulate the design and operational features of ships.  The IMO periodically revises the SOLAS and LL Convention standards. May 2012 SOLAS amendments entered into force on January 1, 2014. The Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims was recently amended and the amendments are expected to go into effect on June 8, 2015. The amendments alter the limits of liability for loss of life or personal injury claim and property claims against ship-owners.
 
The operation of our ships is also affected by the requirements set forth in Chapter IX of SOLAS, which sets forth the IMO's International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and Pollution Prevention, (the “ISM Code”). The ISM Code requires ship owners and bareboat charterers to develop and maintain an extensive Safety Management System (“SMS”) that includes among other things the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for safe operation and describing procedures for dealing with emergencies. We rely upon the safety management system that we and our technical manager have developed for compliance with the ISM Code. The failure of a ship owner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM Code may subject such party to increased liability, may decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. As of the date of this filing, all of the vessels in our operating fleet are ISM code-certified. 
 
The ISM Code requires that vessel operators obtain a safety management certificate, or SMC, for each vessel they operate. This certificate evidences compliance by a vessel’s operators with the ISM Code requirements for a safety management system, or SMS. No vessel can obtain an SMC under the ISM Code unless its manager has been awarded a document of compliance, or DOC, issued in most instances by the vessel's flag state. Our appointed ship managers have obtained documents of compliance for their offices and safety management certificates for all of our vessels for which the certificates are required by the IMO, which are renewed as required.

Pollution Control and Liability Requirements

The IMO has negotiated international conventions that impose liability for pollution in international waters and the territorial waters of the signatories to such conventions.  For example, the IMO adopted the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments in February 2004 (the “BWM Convention”). The BWM Convention’s implementing regulations called for a phased introduction of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements, to be replaced in time with mandatory concentration limits. On September 8, 2016, the BWM Convention met the requirement to be adopted by 30 states, the combined merchant fleets of which represent not less than 35% of the gross tonnage of the world's merchant shipping, becoming effective 12 months later on September 8, 2017. Many of the implementation dates originally written in the BWM Convention have already passed, so that once the BWM Convention enters into force, the period for installation of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements would be extremely short, with several thousand ships a year needing to install ballast water management systems (“BWMS”). For this reason, on December 4, 2013, the IMO Assembly passed a resolution revising the application dates of BWM Convention so that they are triggered by the entry into force date and not the dates originally in the BWM Convention. This in effect makes all vessels constructed before the entry into force date “existing’ vessels, and allows for the installation of a BWMS on such vessels at the first renewal survey following entry into force. The mid-ocean ballast exchange or ballast water treatment requirements became mandatory. The cost of compliance could increase for ocean carriers. Although we do not believe that the costs of such compliance would be material, it is difficult to predict the overall impact of such a requirement on our operations. On March 23, 2012, the USCG issued amended regulations relating to ballast water management for vessels operating in U.S. waters. The costs of compliance with ballast water treatment regulations may be material. 
 
The IMO adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (the “Bunker Convention”) to impose strict liability on ship owners for pollution damage in jurisdictional waters of ratifying states caused by discharges of bunker fuel. The Bunker Convention requires registered owners of ships over 1,000 gross tons to maintain insurance for pollution damage in an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national or international limitation regime (but not exceeding the amount calculated in accordance with the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims of 1976, as amended). With respect to non-ratifying states, liability for spills or releases of oil carried as fuel in ship’s bunkers typically is determined by the national or other domestic laws in the jurisdiction where the events or damages occur.
 
In March 2006, the IMO amended Annex I to MARPOL, including a regulation relating to oil fuel tank protection, which became effective August 1, 2007. The regulation applies to various ships delivered on or after August 1, 2010. The requirements it contains address issues like the fuel tanks, protected location accidental oil fuel outflow performance standards, a tank capacity limit and certain other maintenance, inspection and engineering standards.
 
IMO regulations also require owners and operators of certain vessels to adopt Ship Oil Pollution Emergency Plans. Periodic training and drills for response personnel and for vessels and their crews are required.
 
Anti-Fouling Requirements

In 2001, the IMO adopted the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships, the Anti-fouling Convention.  The Anti-fouling Convention prohibits the use of organotin compound coatings to prevent the attachment of mollusks and other sea life to the hulls of vessels.  Vessels of over 400 gross tons engaged in international voyages are required to undergo an initial survey before the vessel is put into service or before an International Anti-fouling System Certificate is issued for the first time; and subsequent surveys when the anti-fouling systems are altered or replaced. We have obtained Anti-fouling System Certificates for all of our vessels that are subject to the Anti-fouling Convention.
 
The IMO continues to review and introduce new regulations. For example, in July 2011, MARPOL adopted amendments for the prevention of air pollution, which designate certain waters near the coasts of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands ECAs for emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and particulate matter. The new ECA designation entered into force on January 1, 2014. It is impossible to predict what additional regulations, if any, may be passed by the IMO and what effect, if any, such regulations might have on our operations.
 
Compliance Enforcement
 
The flag state, as defined by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, is responsible for implementing and enforcing a broad range of international maritime regulations with respect to all ships granted the right to fly its flag.  The “Shipping Industry Guidelines on Flag State Performance” evaluates and reports on flag states based on factors such as sufficiency of infrastructure, ratification, implementation, and enforcement of principal international maritime treaties, supervision of statutory ship surveys, casualty investigations, and participation at IMO and International Labor Organization (“ILO”) meetings. Our vessels are flagged in the Marshall Islands. Marshall Islands-flagged vessels have historically received a good assessment in the shipping industry.  We recognize the importance of a credible flag state and do not intend to use flags of convenience or flag states with poor performance indicators.
 
 
14



Noncompliance with the ISM Code or other IMO regulations may subject the ship owner or bareboat charterer to increased liability, lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. As of the date of this report, each of our vessels is ISM Code certified.  However, there can be no assurance that such certificates will be maintained in the future.
 
The IMO continues to introduce new regulations. It is impossible to predict what additional regulations, if any, may be passed by the IMO and what effect, if any, such regulations might have on our operations.
 
The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act

The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from oil spills. OPA affects all “owners and operators” whose vessels trade with the United States, its territories and possessions or whose vessels operate in United States waters, which includes the United States’ territorial sea and its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the United States.  The United States has also enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), which applies to the discharge of hazardous substances other than oil, except in limited circumstances whether on land or at sea. OPA and CERCLA both define “owner and operator” “in the case of a vessel, as any person owning, operating or chartering by demise, the vessel.”  Both OPA and CERCLA impact our operations.
 
Under OPA, vessel owners and operators are “responsible parties” and are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war) for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels. OPA defines these other damages broadly to include:
 

● | Injury to, destruction or loss of, or loss of use of, natural resources and related assessment costs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Injury to, or economic losses resulting from, the destruction of real and personal property;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Net loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees or net profit revenues resulting from injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property, or natural resources;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Loss of subsistence use of natural resources that are injured, destroyed, or lost;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property or natural resources; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Net cost of increased of additional public services necessitated by removal activities following a discharge of oil such as protection from fire, safety or health hazards, and loss of subsistence use of natural resources.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
OPA contains statutory caps on liability and damages; such caps do not apply to direct cleanup costs.  Effective July 31, 2009, the USCG adjusted the limits of OPA liability for non-tank vessels (e.g. dry bulk) to the greater of $1,000 per gross ton or $854,400 (subject to periodic adjustment for inflation).  These limits of liability do not apply if an incident was proximately caused by the violation of an applicable U.S. federal safety, construction or operating regulation by a responsible party (or its agent, employee or a person acting pursuant to a contractual relationship), or a responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The limitation on liability similarly does not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses to (i) report the incident where the responsibility party knows or has reason to know of the incident; (ii) reasonably cooperate and assist as requested in connection with oil removal activities; or (iii) without sufficient cause, comply with an order issued under the Federal Water Pollution Act (Section 311 (c), (e)) or the Intervention on the High Seas Act.
 
CERCLA contains a similar liability regime whereby owners and operators of vessels are liable for cleanup, removal and remedial costs, as well as damage for injury to, or destruction or loss of, natural resources, including the reasonable costs associated with assessing same, and health assessments or health effects studies. There is no liability if the discharge of a hazardous substance results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war. Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5.0 million for vessels carrying a hazardous substance as cargo or residue and the greater of $300 per gross ton or $500,000 for any other vessel. These limits do not apply (rendering the responsible person liable for the total cost of response and damages) if the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance resulted from willful misconduct or negligence, or the primary cause of the release was a violation of applicable safety, construction or operating standards or regulations.  The limitation on liability also does not apply if the responsible person fails or refused to provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance as requested in connection with response activities where the vessel is subject to OPA.
 
OPA and CERCLA each preserve the right to recover damages under existing law, including maritime tort law.
 
 
15



OPA and CERCLA both require owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the USCG evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the maximum amount of liability to which the particular responsible person may be subject. Vessel owners and operators may satisfy their financial responsibility obligations by providing a proof of insurance, a surety bond, qualification as a self-insurer or a guarantee. We have complied with the regulations by providing a certificate of responsibility from third party entities that are acceptable to the USCG evidencing sufficient self-insurance.
 
We currently maintain pollution liability coverage insurance in the amount of $1 billion per incident for each of our vessels. If the damages from a catastrophic spill were to exceed our insurance coverages, it could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation.
 
OPA specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries, provided they accept, at a minimum, the levels of liability established under OPA and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for oil spills. In some cases, states which have enacted such legislation have not yet issued implementing regulations defining vessel owners’ responsibilities under these laws. We intend to comply with all applicable state regulations in the ports where our vessels call. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable existing state requirements. In addition, we intend to comply with all future applicable state regulations in the ports where our vessels call.
 
Other Environmental Initiatives
 
The U.S. Clean Water Act (the “CWA”) prohibits the discharge of oil, hazardous substances and ballast water in U.S. navigable waters unless authorized by a duly-issued permit or exemption, and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under OPA and CERCLA. Furthermore, many U.S. states that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law.
 
The EPA and the USCG, have enacted rules relating to ballast water discharge, compliance with which requires the installation of equipment on our vessels to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures at potentially substantial cost, and/or otherwise restrict our vessels from entering U.S. waters.
 
The EPA has enacted rules requiring a permit regulating ballast water discharges and other discharges incidental to the normal operation of certain vessels within United States waters under the Vessel General Permit for Discharges Incidental to the Normal Operation of Vessels (“the VGP”). For a new vessel delivered to an owner or operator after September 19, 2009 to be covered by the VGP, the owner must submit a Notice of Intent (“NOI”) at least 30 days before the vessel operates in United States waters. On March 28, 2013, the EPA re-issued the VGP for another five years; this 2013 VGP took effect December 19, 2013. The 2013 VGP contains numeric ballast water discharge limits for most vessels to reduce the risk of invasive species in US waters, more stringent requirements for exhaust gas scrubbers and the use of environmentally acceptable lubricants. We have submitted NOIs for our vessels where required and do not believe that the costs associated with obtaining and complying with the VGP will have a material impact on our operations.
 
In addition, under Section 401 of the CWA, the VGP must be certified by the state where the discharge is to take place. Certain states have enacted additional discharge standards as conditions to their certification of the VGP. These local standards bring the VGP into compliance with more stringent state requirements, such as those further restricting ballast water discharges and preventing the introduction of non-indigenous species considered to be invasive. The VGP and its state-specific regulations and any similar restrictions enacted in the future will increase the costs of operating in the relevant waters.
 
The USCG, regulations adopted under the U.S. National Invasive Species Act also impose mandatory ballast water management practices for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks entering or operating in U.S. waters which require the installation of equipment to treat ballast water before it is discharged in U.S. waters or, in the alternative, the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures. Vessels not complying with these regulations are restricted from entering U.S. waters. The USCG must approve any technology before it is placed on a vessel.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, as of January 1, 2014, vessels are technically subject to the phasing-in of these standards. As a result, the USCG has provided waivers to vessels which cannot install the as-yet unapproved technology. The EPA, on the other hand, has taken a different approach to enforcing ballast discharge standards under the VGP. On December 27, 2013, the EPA issued an enforcement response policy in connection with the new VGP in which the EPA indicated that it would take into account the reasons why vessels do not have the requisite technology installed, but will not grant any waivers.

The U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970 (including its amendments of 1977 and 1990) (the “CAA”) requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. The CAA also requires states to draft State Implementation Plans (“SIPs”) designed to attain national health-based air quality standards in each state.  Although state-specific, SIPs may include regulations concerning emissions resulting from vessel loading and unloading operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment.
 
As referenced above, the amended Annex VI to the IMO's MARPOL Convention, which addresses air pollution from ships, was ratified by the United States on October 8, 2008 and entered into force on January 1, 2010. The EPA and the state of California, however, have each proposed more stringent regulations of air emissions from ocean-going vessels. On July 24, 2008, the California Air Resources Board of the State of California (“CARB”), approved clean-fuel regulations applicable to all vessels sailing within 24 miles of the California coastline. The new CARB regulations require such vessels to use low sulfur marine fuels rather than bunker fuel. As of July 1, 2009, such vessels were required to switch either to marine gas oil with a sulfur content of no more than 1.5% or marine diesel oil with a sulfur content of no more than 0.5%. As of August 1, 2012, only marine gas oil with a sulfur content of no more than 1% or marine diesel oil with a sulfur content of no more than 0.5% is allowed.  As of January 1, 2014, only marine gas oil and marine diesel oil fuels with 0.1% sulfur is allowed. These new regulations may require significant expenditures on low-sulfur fuel and would increase our operating costs. 
 
Our operations occasionally generate and require the transportation, treatment and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA,”) or comparable state, local or foreign requirements.  The RCRA imposes significant recordkeeping and reporting requirements on transporters of hazardous waste. In addition, from time to time we arrange for the disposal of hazardous waste or hazardous substances at offsite disposal facilities. If such materials are improperly disposed of by third parties, we may still be held liable for cleanup costs under applicable laws.
 
In October 2009, the EU amended a directive to impose criminal sanctions for illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances, including minor discharges, if committed with intent, recklessly or with serious negligence and the discharges individually or in the aggregate result in deterioration of the quality of water. Aiding and abetting the discharge of a polluting substance may also lead to criminal penalties.  Member States were required to enact laws or regulations to comply with the directive by the end of 2010.  Criminal liability for pollution may result in substantial penalties or fines and increased civil liability claims.  The directive applies to all types of vessels, irrespective of their flag, but certain exceptions apply to warships or where human safety or that of the ship is in danger.
 
Greenhouse Gas Regulation

Currently, the emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which entered into force in 2005 and pursuant to which adopting countries have been required to implement national programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  As of January 1, 2013, all new ships must comply with two new sets of mandatory requirements, which were adopted by MEPC in July 2011, to address greenhouse gas emissions from ships. Currently operating ships will be required to develop Ship Energy Efficient Management Plans, and minimum energy efficiency levels per capacity mile will apply to new ships, as defined by the Energy Efficiency Design Index .These requirements could cause us to incur additional compliance costs. The IMO is also planning to implement market-based mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships at an upcoming MEPC session. The European Parliament and Council of Ministers are expected to endorse regulations that would require monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from marine vessels in 2015. In the United States, the EPA has issued a finding that greenhouse gases endanger the public health and safety and has adopted regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain mobile sources and large stationary sources. The EPA enforces both the CAA and the international standards found in Annex VI of MARPOL concerning marine diesel emissions, and the sulfur content found in marine fuel. Any passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, the EU, the U.S. or other countries where we operate, or any treaty adopted at the international level to succeed the Kyoto Protocol, that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to make significant financial expenditures, including capital expenditures to upgrade our vessels, which we cannot predict with certainty at this time.
International Labor Organization

ILO is a specialized agency of the UN with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The ILO has adopted the Maritime Labor Convention 2006 (the “MLC 2006”). A Maritime Labor Certificate and a Declaration of Maritime Labor Compliance will be required to ensure compliance with the MLC 2006 for all ships above 500 gross tons in international trade. The MLC 2006 entered into force on August 20, 2013. The MLC 2006 requires us to develop new procedures to ensure full compliance.

Vessel Security Regulations
 
Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security such as the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”).  To implement certain portions of the MTSA, in July 2003, the USCG issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.  The regulations also impose requirements on certain ports and facilities, some of which are regulated by the EPA.
 
Similarly, in December 2002, amendments to SOLAS created a new chapter of the convention dealing specifically with maritime security.  The new Chapter V became effective in July 2004 and imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities, and mandates compliance with the International Ship and Port Facilities Security Code (“ISPS Code”). The ISPS Code is designed to enhance the security of ports and ships against terrorism.  Amendments to SOLAS Chapter VII, made mandatory in 2004, apply to vessels transporting dangerous goods and require those vessels be in compliance with the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code. To trade internationally, a vessel must attain an International Ship Security Certificate (“ISSC”) from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel’s flag state.  Among the various requirements are:
 

● | On-board installation of automatic identification systems to provide a means for the automatic transmission of safety-related information from among similarly equipped ships and shore stations, including information on a ship’s identity, position, course, speed and navigational status;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On board installation of ship security alert systems, which do not sound on the vessel but only alert the authorities on shore; the development of vessel security plans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ship identification number to be permanently marked on a vessel’s hull;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A continuous synopsis record kept onboard showing a vessel’s history including the name of the ship, the state whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, the date on which the ship was registered with that state, the ship’s identification number, the port at which the ship is registered and the name of the registered owner(s) and their registered address; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Compliance with flag state security certification requirements.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
Ships operating without a valid certificate may be detained at port until it obtains an ISSC, or it may be expelled from port, or refused entry at port.
 
Furthermore, additional security measures could be required in the future which could have a significant financial impact on us. The USCG regulations, intended to be aligned with international maritime security standards, exempt non-U.S. vessels from MTSA vessel security measures, provided such vessels have on board a valid ISSC that attests to the vessel's compliance with SOLAS security requirements and the ISPS Code. We have implemented the various security measures addressed by the MTSA, SOLAS and the ISPS Code.
 
Financial Regulations
 
Our business operations in countries outside the U.S. are subject to a number of laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), as well as economic sanctions and trade embargos administered by OFAC. The FCPA prohibits bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. OFAC administers and enforces economic sanctions and trade embargos based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations and individuals. 

In November 2015, the Company filed a voluntary self-disclosure report with OFAC regarding certain apparent violations of U.S. sanctions regulations in the provision of shipping services for third party charterers with respect to the transportation of cargo to or from Myanmar. While the ultimate impact of these matters cannot be determined, there can be no assurance that the impact will not be material to the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. See “Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies – Legal Proceedings” of the financial statements.
   
Inspection by Classification Societies
 
Every oceangoing vessel must be “classed” by a classification society. The classification society certifies that the vessel is "in class," signifying that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the vessel's country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the classification society will undertake them on application or by official order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned.
 
 
18



The classification society also undertakes on request other surveys and checks that are required by regulations and requirements of the flag state. These surveys are subject to agreements made in each individual case and/or to the regulations of the country concerned.
 
For maintenance of the class certification, regular and extraordinary surveys of hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and any special equipment classed are required to be performed as follows:
 
Annual Surveys. For seagoing ships, annual surveys are conducted for the hull and the machinery, including the electrical plant, and where applicable for special equipment classed, within three months before or after each anniversary date of the date of commencement of the class period indicated in the certificate.
 
Intermediate Surveys. Extended annual surveys are referred to as intermediate surveys and typically are conducted two and one-half years after commissioning and each class renewal.  Intermediate surveys are to be carried out at or between the second or third annual survey.
 
Class Renewal Surveys. Class renewal surveys, also known as special surveys, are carried out for the ship’s hull, machinery, including the electrical plant and for any special equipment classed, at the intervals indicated by the character of classification for the hull. At the special survey the vessel is thoroughly examined, including audio-gauging to determine the thickness of the steel structures. Should the thickness be found to be less than class requirements, the classification society would prescribe steel renewals. The classification society may grant a one year grace period for completion of the special survey. Substantial amounts of money may have to be spent for steel renewals to pass a special survey if the vessel experiences excessive wear and tear. In lieu of the special survey approximately every five years, depending on whether a grace period was granted, a ship owner has the option of arranging with the classification society for the vessel’s hull or machinery to be on a continuous survey cycle, in which every part of the vessel would be surveyed within a five year cycle. At an owner’s application, the surveys required for class renewal may be split according to an agreed schedule to extend over the entire period of class. This process is referred to as continuous class renewal.
 
All areas subject to survey as defined by the classification society are required to be surveyed at least once per class period, unless shorter intervals between surveys are prescribed elsewhere. The period between two subsequent surveys of each area must not exceed five years.
 
Most vessels are also drydocked every 30 to 36 months for inspection of the underwater parts and for repairs related to inspections. If any defects are found, the classification surveyor will issue a "recommendation" which must be rectified by the ship owner within prescribed time limits.
 
Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage that a vessel be certified as “in class” by a classification society which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies (the “IACS”). In December 2013, the IACS adopted new harmonized Common Structure Rules, which will apply to oil tankers and bulk carriers to be constructed on or after July 1, 2015. All our vessels that we have purchased and may agree to purchase in the future must be certified as being “in class” prior to their delivery under our standard purchase contracts and memorandum of agreement. If the vessel is not certified on the date of closing, we have no obligation to take delivery of the vessel. We have all of our vessels, and intend to have all vessels that we acquire in the future, classed by IACS members.
 
Risk of Loss and Liability Insurance
 
General
 
The operation of any dry bulk vessel includes risks such as mechanical failure, collision, property loss, cargo loss or damage and business interruption due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities and labor strikes. In addition, there is always an inherent possibility of marine disaster, including oil spills (e.g. fuel oil) and other environmental mishaps, and the liabilities arising from owning and operating vessels in international trade. OPA, which imposes virtually unlimited liability upon owners, operators and demise charterers of vessels trading in the United States exclusive economic zone for certain oil pollution accidents in the United States, has made liability insurance more expensive for ship owners and operators trading in the U.S. market.
 
While we maintain hull and machinery insurance, war risks insurance, protection and indemnity cover and freight, demurrage and defense cover for our operating fleet in amounts that we believe to be prudent to cover normal risks in our operations, we may not be able to achieve or maintain this level of coverage throughout a vessel's useful life. Furthermore, while we believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate, not all risks can be insured, and there can be no guarantee that any specific claim will be paid, or that we will always be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates.
 
 
19



Hull & Machinery and War Risks Insurance
 
We maintain marine hull and machinery, war risks insurances, which cover the risk of actual or constructive total loss for all of our vessels. Our vessels are each covered up to at least their fair market value with a deductible of $100,000 per vessel per incident.
Protection and Indemnity Insurance
 
Protection and indemnity insurance is provided by mutual protection and indemnity associations (“P&I Associations”), which insure our third-party liabilities in connection with our shipping activities. This includes third-party liability and other related expenses resulting from the injury, illness or death of crew, passengers and other third parties, the loss or damage to cargo, claims arising from collisions with other vessels, damage to other third-party property, pollution arising from oil or other substances and salvage, towing and other related costs, including wreck removal. Protection and indemnity insurance is a form of mutual indemnity insurance, extended by protection and indemnity mutual associations, or "clubs." Subject to the "capping" discussed below, our coverage, except for pollution, is unlimited.
 
Our current protection and indemnity insurance coverage for pollution is $1 billion per vessel per incident. The 13 P&I Associations that comprise the International Group insure approximately 90% of the world’s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association’s liabilities. As a member of a P&I Association, which is a member of the International Group, we are subject to calls payable to the associations based on the group’s claim records as well as the claim records of all other members of the individual associations and members of the pool of P&I Associations comprising the International Group.
 
Competition
 
We compete with a large number of international dry bulk owners. The international shipping industry is highly competitive and fragmented with many market participants with no single owner accounting for more than 5% of tonnage shipped in 2016. As of December 31, 2016 there are approximately 10,867 dry bulk carriers aggregating approximately 794 million dwt. We compete with other (primarily private) owners of dry bulk vessels in the Handysize, Handymax, and Panamax asset classes.
 
Competition in the ocean shipping industry varies primarily according to the nature of the contractual relationship as well as with respect to the kind of commodity being shipped. Our business will fluctuate in line with the main patterns of trade of dry bulk cargoes and varies according to changes in the supply and demand for these items. Competition in virtually all bulk trades is intense and based primarily on supply and demand. We compete for charters on the basis of price, vessel location, size, age and condition of the vessel, as well as on our reputation as an owner and operator. Increasingly, major customers are demonstrating a preference for modern vessels based on concerns about the environmental and operational risks associated with older vessels. Consequently, owners of large modern fleets have gained a competitive advantage over owners of older fleets.
 
As in the spot market, the time charter market is price sensitive and also depends on our ability to demonstrate the high quality of our vessels and operations to chartering customers. However, because of the longer term commitment, customers entering time charters are more concerned about their exposure and image from chartering vessels that do not comply with environmental regulations or that will be forced out of service for extensive maintenance and repairs. Consequently, in the time charter market, factors such as the age and quality of a vessel and the reputation of the owner and operator tend to be more significant than in the spot market in competing for business.
 
Seasonality
 
Demand for vessel capacity has historically exhibited seasonal variations and, as a result, fluctuations in charter rates. This seasonality may result in quarter-to-quarter volatility in our operating results for our vessels trading in the spot market and our vessels operating under time index-based time charters. The dry bulk carrier market is typically stronger in the fall and winter months in anticipation of increased consumption of coal and other raw materials in the northern hemisphere during the winter months. In addition, unpredictable weather patterns in these months tend to disrupt vessel scheduling and supplies of certain commodities. To the extent that we must enter into a new charter or renew an existing charter for a vessel in our fleet during a time when seasonal variations have reduced prevailing charter rates, our operating results may be adversely affected.
Value of Assets and Cash Requirements
 
The replacement costs of comparable new vessels may be above or below the book value of our fleet. The market value of our fleet may be below book value when market conditions are weak and exceed book value when markets are strong. In common with other ship owners, we may consider asset redeployment which at times may include the sale of vessels at less than their book value.
 
 
20



The Company's results of operations and cash flows may be significantly affected by future charter and COA markets.
   
Exchange Controls
 
Under Marshall Islands law, there are currently no restrictions on the export or import of capital, including foreign exchange controls or restrictions that affect the remittance of dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of our common stock.
Tax Considerations
  
The following is a discussion of the material Marshall Islands and United States federal income tax considerations relevant to owning common stock by a United States Holder or a Non-United States Holder, each as defined below. This discussion does not purport to deal with the tax consequences of owning the common stock to all categories of investors, some of which (such as financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, persons holding our common stock as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle, traders in securities that have elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons who are investors in pass-through entities, dealers in securities or currencies, persons who own 10% or more of our common stock and investors whose functional currency is not the United States dollar) may be subject to special rules. This discussion deals only with holders who own the common stock as a capital asset. Shareholders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the overall tax consequences arising in their own particular situation under United States federal, state, local or foreign law of the ownership of our common stock.
Marshall Islands Tax Considerations
 
In the opinion of Seward & Kissel LLP, the following are the material Marshall Islands tax consequences of our activities to us and shareholders of our common stock. We are incorporated in the Marshall Islands. Under current Marshall Islands law, we are not subject to tax on income or capital gains, and no Marshall Islands withholding tax will be imposed upon payments of dividends by us to our shareholders.
United States Federal Income Tax Considerations
 
In the opinion of Seward & Kissel LLP, our United States tax counsel, the following are the material United States federal income tax consequences to us of our activities and to United States Holders and to Non-United States Holders of our common stock. The following discussion of United States federal income tax matters is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, judicial decisions, administrative pronouncements, and existing and proposed regulations issued by the United States Department of the Treasury, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. In addition, the discussion below is based, in part, on the description of our business as described in “Item 1. Business” in this Annual Report and assumes that we conduct our business as described in that section.
 
We have made, or will make, special United States federal income tax elections in respect of each of our ship owning or operating subsidiaries that is potentially subject to tax as a result of deriving income attributable to the transportation of cargoes to or from the United States. The effect of the special U.S. tax elections is to ignore or disregard the subsidiaries for which elections have been made as separate taxable entities and to treat them as part of their parent, the ''Company.'' Therefore, for purposes of the following discussion, the Company, and not the subsidiaries subject to this special election, will be treated as the owner and operator of the vessels and as receiving the income therefrom.
 
United States Federal Income Taxation of Our Company
 
Taxation of Operating Income: In General
 
The Company currently earns, and anticipates that it will continue to earn, substantially all its income from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time or voyage charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses, all of which we refer to as ''shipping income.''
 
 
21



Unless exempt from United States federal income taxation under the rules of Section 883 of the Code (“Section 883”), as discussed below, a foreign corporation such as ourselves will be subject to United States federal income taxation on its ''shipping income'' that is treated as derived from sources within the United States, to which we refer as ''United States source shipping income.'' For tax purposes, ''United States source shipping income'' includes 50% of shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States.
 
Shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between non-United States ports will be considered to be 100% derived from sources outside the United States. Shipping income derived from sources outside the United States will not be subject to any United States federal income tax.
 
Shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between United States ports is considered to be 100% derived from United States sources. However, the Company is not permitted by United States law to engage in the transportation of cargoes that produces 100% United States source income.
 
Unless exempt from tax under Section 883, the Company's gross United States source shipping income would be subject to a 4% tax imposed without allowance for deductions as described below.
 
Exemption of Operating Income from United States Federal Income Taxation
 
Under Section 883 and the regulations thereunder, a foreign corporation will be exempt from United States federal income taxation on its United States source shipping income if:

● | it is organized in a qualified foreign country, which is one that grants an ''equivalent exemption'' from tax to corporations organized in the United States in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under Section 883 and to which we refer as the ''Country of Organization Test''; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | one of the following tests is met:
--+-----------------------------------


o | more than 50% of the value of its shares is beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by qualified shareholders, which as defined includes individuals who are ''residents'' of a qualified foreign country, to which we refer as the ''50% Ownership Test'';
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | subject to an exception for closely-held corporations, its shares are ''primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market'' in a qualified foreign country or in the United States, to which we refer as the "Publicly-Traded Test"; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | it is a ''controlled foreign corporation'' and satisfies an ownership test, to which, collectively, we refer to as the ''CFC Test.''
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Republic of the Marshall Islands, the jurisdiction where the Company is incorporated, has been officially recognized by the United States Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) as a qualified foreign country that grants the requisite ''equivalent exemption'' from tax in respect of each category of shipping income the Company earns and currently expects to earn in the future. Therefore, the Company will be exempt from United States federal income taxation with respect to its United States source shipping income if it satisfies any one of the 50% Ownership Test, the Publicly-Traded Test, or the CFC Test.
 
For its 2016 taxable year, the Company does not believe it satisfied any of the ownership tests. As a result, the Company expects to be subject to United States federal income taxation on its United States source shipping income and its sale of vessels as discussed in more detail below. Depending on the composition of its ownership, the Company may qualify for the benefits of Section 883 for future taxable years.
 
Taxation in Absence of Section 883 Exemption
 
Because the Company does not qualify for the benefits of Section 883 for the 2016 taxable year, the Company's United States source shipping income was subject to a 4% tax imposed by Section 887 of the Code on a gross basis, without the benefit of deductions, to the extent that such income is not considered to be ''effectively connected'' with the conduct of a United States trade or business, as described below. Since under the sourcing rules described above, no more than 50% of the Company's shipping income would be treated as being United States source shipping income, the maximum effective rate of United States federal income tax on the Company’s shipping income can never exceed 2% under the 4% gross basis tax regime. The Company’s United States federal income tax liability was approximately $648,570 for the taxable year ended December 31, 2016 and is included in voyage expenses in our consolidated statement of operations. It should be noted that with respect to any future taxable year, the Company can give no assurance that the operation of its vessels, which are under the control of third party charterers, will not change such that its United States federal income tax liability would be substantially higher.
 
 
22



To the extent the Company's United States source shipping income is considered to be ''effectively connected'' with the conduct of a United States trade or business, as described below, any such ''effectively connected'' United States source shipping income, net of applicable deductions, would be subject to United States federal income tax, currently imposed at rates of up to 35%. In addition, the Company may be subject to the 30% ''branch profits'' tax on earnings effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business, as determined after allowance for certain adjustments, and on certain interest paid or deemed paid attributable to the conduct of the Company's United States trade or business.
 
The Company's United States source shipping income would be considered ''effectively connected'' with the conduct of a United States trade or business only if:
 

● | the Company has, or is considered to have, a fixed place of business in the United States involved in the earning of United States source shipping income; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | substantially all of the Company's United States source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company did not have any vessel sailing to or from the United States on a regularly scheduled basis during its 2016 taxable year. The Company does not intend to have, or permit circumstances that would result in having, any such vessels in future taxable years, but there can be no assurances that this will be the case. Based on the foregoing and on the expected mode of the Company's shipping operations and other activities, the Company believes that none of its United States source shipping income will be ''effectively connected'' with the conduct of a United States trade or business for its 2016 taxable year or any future taxable year.
 
United States Taxation of Gain on Sale of Vessels
 

Assuming that any decision on a vessel sale is made from and attributable to the United States office of the Company, as we believe likely to be the case as the Company is currently structured, then any gain derived from the sale of any such vessel will be treated as derived from United States sources and subject to United States federal income tax as ''effectively connected'' income (determined under rules different from those discussed above) under the above described net income tax regime. If the Company were to qualify for exemption from tax under Section 883 in respect of the shipping income derived from the international operation of its vessels, then gain from the sale of any such vessel should likewise be exempt from tax under Section 883.
United States Federal Income Taxation of United States Holders
 
As used herein, the term ''United States Holder'' means a beneficial owner of our common stock that is an individual United States citizen or resident, a United States corporation or other United States entity taxable as a corporation, an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
 
If a partnership holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding our common stock, you are encouraged to consult your tax advisor.
 
Distributions
 
Subject to the discussion of passive foreign investment companies below, any distributions made by the Company with respect to its common stock to a United States Holder will generally constitute dividends to the extent of the Company's current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under United States federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of such earnings and profits will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the United States Holder's tax basis in his common stock on a dollar-for-dollar basis and thereafter as capital gain. Because the Company is not a United States corporation, United States Holders that are corporations will not be entitled to claim a dividends received deduction with respect to any distributions they receive from us. Dividends paid with respect to the Company's common stock will generally be treated as ''passive category income'' for purposes of computing allowable foreign tax credits for United States foreign tax credit purposes.
 
 
23



Dividends paid on the Company's common stock to a United States Holder who is an individual, trust or estate (a ''United States Non-Corporate Holder'') will generally be treated as ''qualified dividend income'' that is taxable to such United States Non-Corporate Holder at preferential tax rates provided that (1) the common stock is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States (such as the Nasdaq Global Select Market on which the Company's common stock is traded); (2) the Company is not a passive foreign investment company for the taxable year during which the dividend is paid or the immediately preceding taxable year (which we do not believe we have been, are or will be); (3) the United States Non-Corporate Holder has owned the common stock for more than 60 days in the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the date on which the common stock becomes ex-dividend; and (4) the United States Non-Corporate Holder is not under an obligation to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property.
 
There is no assurance that any dividends paid on the Company's common stock will be eligible for these preferential rates in the hands of a United States Non-Corporate Holder, although we believe that they will be so eligible. Any dividends out of earnings, and profits the Company pays, which are not eligible for these preferential rates will be taxed as ordinary income to a United States Non-Corporate Holder.
 
Special rules may apply to any ''extraordinary dividend''—generally, a dividend in an amount which is equal to or in excess of 10% of a shareholder's adjusted basis in a common share—paid by the Company. If the Company pays an ''extraordinary dividend'' on its common stock that is treated as ''qualified dividend income,'' then any loss derived by a United States Non-Corporate Holder from the sale or exchange of such common stock will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of such dividend.
 
Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Stock
 
Assuming the Company does not constitute a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year, a United States Holder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss upon a sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company's common stock in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized by the United States Holder from such sale, exchange or other disposition and the United States Holder's tax basis in such stock. Such gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the United States Holder's holding period is greater than one year at the time of the sale, exchange or other disposition. Such capital gain or loss will generally be treated as United States source income or loss, as applicable, for United States foreign tax credit purposes. Long-term capital gains of United States Non-Corporate Holders are currently eligible for reduced rates of taxation. A United States Holder's ability to deduct capital losses is subject to certain limitations.
Passive Foreign Investment Company Status and Significant Tax Consequences
 
Special United States federal income tax rules apply to a United States Holder that holds shares in a foreign corporation classified as a ''passive foreign investment company'' for United States federal income tax purposes. In general, the Company will be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to a United States Holder if, for any taxable year in which such holder holds the Company's common stock, either:

● | at least 75% of our gross income for such taxable year consists of passive income (e.g., dividends, interest, capital gains and rents derived other than in the active conduct of a rental business); or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | at least 50% of the average value of our assets during such taxable year produce, or are held for the production of, passive income.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Income earned, or deemed earned, by the Company in connection with the performance of services would not constitute passive income. By contrast, rental income would generally constitute ''passive income'' unless the Company was treated under specific rules as deriving its rental income in the active conduct of a trade or business.
 
Based on the Company's current operations and future projections, we do not believe that the Company has been or is, nor do we expect the Company to become, a passive foreign investment company with respect to any taxable year. Although there is no legal authority directly on point, our belief is based principally on the position that, for purposes of determining whether the Company is a passive foreign investment company, the gross income it derives from its time chartering and voyage chartering activities should constitute services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, such income should not constitute passive income, and the assets that the Company owns and operates in connection with the production of such income, in particular, the vessels, should not constitute passive assets for purposes of determining whether the Company is a passive foreign investment company. 
 
We believe there is substantial legal authority supporting our position consisting of case law and IRS pronouncements concerning the characterization of income derived from time charters and voyage charters as services income for other tax purposes. However, there is also authority which characterizes time charter income as rental income rather than services income for other tax purposes. In addition, we have obtained an opinion from our counsel, Seward & Kissel LLP, that, based upon the Company's operations as described herein, its income from time charters and voyage charters should not be treated as passive income for purposes of determining whether it is a passive foreign investment company. However, in the absence of any legal authority specifically relating to the statutory provisions governing passive foreign investment companies, the United States Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS or a court could disagree with our position. In addition, although the Company intends to conduct its affairs in a manner to avoid being classified as a passive foreign investment company with respect to any taxable year, we cannot assure you that the nature of its operations will not change in the future.
 
 
24



As discussed more fully below, if the Company were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year, a United States Holder would be subject to different taxation rules depending on whether the United States Holder makes an election to treat the Company as a ''Qualified Electing Fund,'' which election we refer to as a ''QEF election.'' As an alternative to making a QEF election, a United States Holder should be able to make a ''mark-to-market'' election with respect to the Company's common stock, as discussed below. In addition, if we were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company, a United States holder would be required to file an annual report with the IRS for that year with respect to such holder’s common stock.
 
Taxation of United States Holders Making a Timely QEF Election
  
If a United States Holder makes a timely QEF election, which United States Holder we refer to as an ''Electing Holder,'' the Electing Holder must report for United States federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of the Company's ordinary earnings and net capital gain, if any, for each taxable year of the Company for which it is a passive foreign investment company that ends with or within the taxable year of the Electing Holder, regardless of whether or not distributions were received from the Company by the Electing Holder. No portion of any such inclusions of ordinary earnings will be treated as ''qualified dividend income.'' Net capital gain inclusions of United States Non-Corporate Holders would be eligible for preferential capital gains tax rates. The Electing Holder's adjusted tax basis in the common stock will be increased to reflect taxed but undistributed earnings and profits. Distributions of earnings and profits that had been previously taxed will result in a corresponding reduction in the adjusted tax basis in the common stock and will not be taxed again once distributed. An Electing Holder would not, however, be entitled to a deduction for its pro rata share of any losses that the Company incurs with respect to any year. An Electing Holder would generally recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company's common stock. A United States Holder would make a timely QEF election for shares of the Company by filing one copy of IRS Form 8621 with his United States federal income tax return for the first year in which he held such shares when the Company was a passive foreign investment company. If the Company were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year, the Company would provide each United States Holder with all necessary information in order to make the QEF election described above.
Taxation of United States Holders Making a ''Mark-to-Market'' Election
 
Alternatively, if the Company were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year and, as we anticipate, its shares are treated as "marketable stock", a United States Holder would be allowed to make a ''mark-to-market'' election with respect to the Company's common stock, provided the United States Holder completes and files IRS Form 8621 in accordance with the relevant instructions and related Treasury regulations. If that election is made, the United States Holder generally would include as ordinary income in each taxable year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the common stock at the end of the taxable year over such holder's adjusted tax basis in the common stock. The United States Holder would also be permitted an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the United States Holder's adjusted tax basis in the common stock over its fair market value at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. A United States Holder's tax basis in his common stock would be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amount. Gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company's common stock would be treated as ordinary income, and any loss realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company’s common stock would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent that such loss does not exceed the net mark-to-market gains previously included by the United States Holder. No income inclusions under this election will be treated as "qualified dividend income."
Taxation of United States Holders Not Making a Timely QEF or Mark-to-Market Election
 
Finally, if the Company were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year, a United States Holder who does not make either a QEF election or a ''mark-to-market'' election for that year, whom we refer to as a ''Non-Electing Holder,'' would be subject to special rules with respect to (1) any excess distribution (i.e., the portion of any distributions received by the Non-Electing Holder on the common stock in a taxable year in excess of 125% of the average annual distributions received by the Non-Electing Holder in the three preceding taxable years, or, if shorter, the Non-Electing Holder's holding period for the common stock), and (2) any gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company's common stock. Under these special rules:

● | the excess distribution or gain would be allocated ratably over the Non-Electing Holder's aggregate holding period for the common stock;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
25




● | the amount allocated to the current taxable year, and any taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which the Company was a passive foreign investment company, would be taxed as ordinary income and would not be ''qualified dividend income''; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the amount allocated to each of the other taxable years would be subject to tax at the highest rate of tax in effect for the applicable class of taxpayer for that year, and an interest charge for the deemed deferral benefit would be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such other taxable year.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These special rules would not apply to a qualified pension, profit sharing or other retirement trust or other tax-exempt organization that did not borrow money or otherwise utilize leverage in connection with its acquisition of the Company's common stock. If the Company is a passive foreign investment company and a Non-Electing Holder who is an individual dies while owning the Company's common stock, such holder's successor generally would not receive a step-up in tax basis with respect to such shares.
 
United States Federal Income Taxation of ''Non-United States Holders''
 
A beneficial owner of common stock (other than a partnership) that is not a United States Holder is referred to herein as a "Non-United States Holder".
 
If a partnership holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding our common stock, you are encouraged to consult your tax advisor.
 
Dividends on Common Stock
 
Non-United States Holders generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax or withholding tax on dividends received from the Company with respect to its common stock, unless that income is effectively connected with the Non-United States Holder's conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If the Non-United States Holder is entitled to the benefits of a United States income tax treaty with respect to those dividends, that income is taxable only if it is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-United States Holder in the United States.
Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Stock
 
Non-United States Holders generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain realized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company's common stock, unless:

● | The gain is effectively connected with the Non-United States Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if the Non-United States holder is entitled to the benefits of an income tax treaty with respect to that gain, that gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-United States holder in the United States); or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Non-United States Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of disposition and other conditions are met.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If the Non-United States Holder is engaged in a United States trade or business for United States federal income tax purposes, the income from the common stock, including dividends and the gain from the sale, exchange or other disposition of the shares, that is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business will generally be subject to regular United States federal income tax in the same manner as discussed in the previous section relating to the taxation of United States Holders. In addition, if you are a corporate Non-United States Holder, your earnings and profits that are attributable to the effectively connected income, which are subject to certain adjustments, may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30%, or at a lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty.
 
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
 
In general, dividend payments, or other taxable distributions, made within the United States to you will be subject to information reporting requirements if you are a non-corporate United States Holder. Such payments or distributions may also be subject to backup withholding tax if you are a non-corporate United States Holder and you:

● | Fail to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | Are notified by the IRS that you have failed to report all interest or dividends required to be shown on your federal income tax returns; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
26




● | In certain circumstances, fail to comply with applicable certification requirements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Non-United States Holders may be required to establish their exemption from information reporting and backup withholding by certifying their status on an appropriate IRS Form W-8.
 
If you are a Non-United States Holder and you sell your common stock to or through a United States office of a broker, the payment of the proceeds is subject to both United States backup withholding and information reporting unless you certify that you are a non-United States person, under penalties of perjury, or you otherwise establish an exemption. If you sell your common stock through a non-United States office of a non-United States broker and the sales proceeds are paid to you outside the United States, then information reporting and backup withholding generally will not apply to that payment. However, United States information reporting requirements, but not backup withholding, will apply to a payment of sales proceeds, even if that payment is made to you outside the United States, if you sell your common stock through a non-United States office of a broker that is a United States person or has some other contacts with the United States. Such information reporting requirements will not apply, however, if the broker has documentary evidence in its records that you are a non-United States person and certain other conditions are met, or you otherwise establish an exemption.
 
Backup withholding tax is not an additional tax. Rather, you generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under backup withholding rules that exceed your income tax liability by filing a refund claim with the IRS.
 
Individuals who are United States Holders (and to the extent specified in applicable Treasury regulations, certain United States entities and Non-United States Holders) who hold “specified foreign financial assets” (as defined in Section 6038D of the Code) are required to file IRS Form 8938 with information relating to the asset for each taxable year in which the aggregate value of all such assets exceeds $75,000 at any time during the taxable year or $50,000 on the last day of the taxable year (or such higher dollar amount as prescribed by applicable Treasury regulations). Specified foreign financial assets would include, among other assets, our common shares, unless the shares are held through an account maintained with a United States financial institution. Substantial penalties apply to any failure to timely file IRS Form 8938, unless the failure is shown to be due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. Additionally, in the event an individual United States Holder (and to the extent specified in applicable Treasury regulations, a United States entity and Non-United States Holders) that is required to file IRS Form 8938 does not file such form, the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of United States federal income taxes of such holder for the related tax year may not close until three years after the date that the required information is filed. United States Holders (including United States entities) and Non-United States Holders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding their reporting obligations under this legislation.
