 Business Strategy
 Our overall strategy is to transition into a pure-play fiber bandwidth infrastructure company through pursuit of expansion opportunities, both organic and inorganic. To achieve organic growth, our objective is to leverage and expand our fiber assets to capture the growing demand for data and mobility services among our carrier and enterprise customers in our marketplace. Our operating strategy is to (i) monetize our approximately 10,100 route-mile fiber optic network by selling bandwidth infrastructure services to new and existing carriers and enterprise customers while maintaining our ratio of data revenue from on-net traffic at or above 80%;  (ii) use our “expansion” and "edge-out” strategies to enter into new markets and extend into markets adjacent to our existing footprint to increase our addressable market size; (iii) leverage our growing fiber network to expand to new fiber to the cell opportunities under long term contracts; (iv) proactively manage our churn through several initiatives including upgrading existing customers from legacy technologies to carrier Ethernet services and continually improving network and operational performance; (v) focus on managing resources from the declining legacy voice products into our faster growing and more profitable data products; and (vi) execute our success-based investment strategy in both organic and inorganic opportunities to grow our data business while maintaining our capital efficiency and expanding margins. 
 Our data segment, which provided approximately 60% of our total revenue in 2016, represents the main growth opportunity and is the key focal point of our strategy and includes our enterprise data, transport and FTTC product groups. A significant majority of our capital expenditures and sales force are dedicated to increasing revenue and profit from our data segment. Our data product lines are growing at a pace that significantly exceeds the decline in our legacy product lines, and in the aggregate, due to our focus on on-net 

 
2

 
customers, they also provide a higher gross margin. We believe that a balanced split between enterprise and carrier revenue results in the most effective capital allocation and resulting profitability.  We are focused on taking advantage of increased carrier bandwidth demand, particularly for long-term FTTC contracts from wireless carriers that are deploying long-term evolution (“LTE”) data services, selling into our expansion and edge-out markets, maximizing the use of our carrier end user distribution channel, providing connection to data centers for our enterprise customers and improving penetration in existing markets.
 Our residential and small business (“R&SB”) and RLEC access segments provided approximately 30% and 10% of our total revenue in 2016, respectively.  Our R&SB segment includes legacy voice and IP services products targeted to our residential and small business customers.  Our RLEC access segment provides other carriers access to our network within our RLEC territories, primarily through switched access services.  These segments require limited incremental capital to maintain the underlying assets and deliver reasonably predictable cash flows.  Despite declining revenues as a result of regulatory actions taken to reduce intra-state tariffs, access line loss resulting from residential wireless substitution, technology changes and product replacement of voice service offerings from cable operators in our markets, we expect the cash flows from these legacy businesses to continue to significantly contribute to funding the capital investment in our growing data segment.
 The key imperatives for our data growth initiatives are as follows:
 Enhance Carrier Ethernet Network and Grow FTTC Revenues    As demand for FTTC services, greater data transport bandwidth and guaranteed network stability continues, there is an increasing demand to provide carrier Ethernet networks to our wireless carrier customers and select large data transport customers. In 2014, we completed the core construction of an approximately 850-mile carrier network within our existing fiber network to provide FTTC solutions to multiple large wireless communication providers and select large enterprise customers who operate in our markets and connected the first FTTC sites to this carrier network. The majority of our existing FTTC traffic has now been migrated to this dedicated network. Additionally, since its construction, new traffic has been and will continue to be added directly to this network, including new cell towers installed in our expansion markets of Richmond, VA and Norfolk, VA. We intend to significantly increase FTTC connectivity to cell sites in close proximity to our fiber network over the next several years to capitalize on the growth opportunity in our expanding footprint.  In addition to our initiatives centered on enhancing our network and improving operational performance, we will continue to deliberately and proactively manage our carrier customers with legacy services to our Ethernet-based services with the intent of limiting churn and improving the customer experience.    Enhance Legacy Enterprise Networks and Grow Enterprise Revenues
 As demand for greater data bandwidth and guaranteed network stability continues to grow within enterprise services, we continue to invest capital in expanding and enhancing our enterprise networks to accommodate our customer needs. Growing our enterprise revenues using a success-based expansion approach is critical to ensuring the desired returns on invested capital are met.  As of December 31, 2016, our 10,100 route-mile fiber network was connected to approximately 2,031 buildings.  We believe there is significant prospect to compete for opportunities to connect to additional buildings and data centers in close proximity to our existing fiber network.  Our primary sales channels are enterprise-direct and carrier end user.  Our carrier end user channel facilitates the sale of enterprise data services for national carrier customers that are within our footprint.  Through use of this sales channel we are able to leverage our existing fiber infrastructure to grow revenue and reduce the likelihood of being overbuilt within our markets.  In addition to our initiatives centered on enhancing our network and improving operational performance, we will continue to deliberately and proactively manage our enterprise customers with legacy services to our Ethernet-based services, and appropriately incent our sales force to focus on renewal of long-term contracts with the intent of reducing churn and improving the customer experience.
 Monetize our Expansion Markets and Edge-Out into Key Markets Adjacent to Our Existing Network Footprint
 Driven by demand from existing enterprise and carrier customers, our expansion strategy grows our fiber network into new contiguous markets by leveraging existing and new assets.  In 2016, we added 1,505 route miles of new fiber to our network, which includes the remaining portion of our recently completed 822 route mile expansion in the Richmond and Norfolk area. This expansion was underpinned by a long-term FTTC contract with a national U.S. wireless carrier, which connected a total of approximately 257 new cell sites to our fiber network, most of which were added in early 2016.  We intend to continue to monetize this expansion by selling bandwidth infrastructure services to new and existing carrier and enterprise customers in the Richmond and Norfolk markets. As we expand into these new markets we are significantly increasing our addressable market size, thus allowing us to bring new FTTC carrier customers and enterprise customers onto our fiber networks.  Our edge-out strategy, which focuses on incrementally adding network assets and new customers in markets in close proximity to our existing footprint, is complementary to our expansion strategy in Richmond, VA and Norfolk, VA.    Drive Incremental On-Net Data Traffic
 Our on-net strategy focuses on driving traffic through our network, thereby increasing profitability.  As our network footprint grows and the bandwidth demand increases, we are able to drive incremental revenue through our existing network with minimal increase in operating expenses or incremental capital expenditures.  We evaluate this on-net approach and the associated capital expenditure 

 
3

 
against the revenue opportunity and have determined that maintaining approximately 80% of our data revenue from on-net traffic is the most effective use of capital.
 Use Disciplined, Success-Based Capital Investment Strategy
 We seek to maximize our capital expenditure efficiency by requiring that a significant percentage of our capital investment be tied to specific revenue generating products based on customer commitments, which we refer to as “success-based projects”.  Our success-based capital investment strategy involves maximizing capital expenditure efficiency by pursuing on-net and near-net customer opportunities and maintaining a balanced mix of carrier (including FTTC) and enterprise business.  Our capital investment strategy targets a greater than 15% return on investment and a less than four year payback, along with other strategic considerations.
 Additionally, through the pursuit of inorganic growth opportunities, which would be accretive to our overall financial results and serve to accelerate our transition to a pure-play fiber bandwidth infrastructure, we seek to maximize capital efficiency.
 Business Segments    We have three reportable business segments, as follows:
 Data  
 Our data segment includes our enterprise data, transport and FTTC product groups.  We market and sell these services primarily to carriers and enterprise customers, including healthcare providers, state and local government agencies, financial institutions, educational institutions and other enterprises.  Revenues from our data segment accounted for 59.7%, 56.0% and 52.9% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Data product lines are growing at a pace that significantly exceeds our legacy product lines and in aggregate, they also provide a higher gross margin.  The objective of our data segment is to leverage the ever increasing data bandwidth demands from our enterprise and carrier customers in our existing and expanding addressable markets.
 Our data segment operations are based upon our expansion, edge-out and on-net strategies that seek to capitalize on new markets by maximizing the use of our fiber assets while optimizing capital efficiency and profitability.  In 2016, we continued to invest significant capital towards our growth businesses within our data segment.  Our strategy requires disciplined use of capital expenditures on success-based projects to grow our fiber assets and reach an increasing number of both carrier and enterprise customers. We believe our growth strategies, combined with our commitment to customer service, will continue to attract larger customers in our key vertical markets.
 We generate growth within our data segment through new long-term FTTC contracts with wireless carriers deploying LTE services and bandwidth upgrades on existing contracts, improving enterprise penetration within our existing and new markets and providing greater Ethernet bandwidth to enterprise customers.  In 2016, we added 205 FTTC sites, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 18.7%, and 299 on-net buildings, representing an increase of approximately 17.3% year-over-year.  Our sales force is organized into carrier and enterprise teams to effectively pursue the respective opportunities.  Our ability to sustain or accelerate revenue growth in our data segment depends on our ability to obtain and effectively deploy capital to upgrade and expand our fiber network and implement our expansion and edge-out plans in a timely and disciplined manner, attract new customers and successfully manage churn through customer retention programs, including upgrading existing customers from legacy technologies to carrier Ethernet services. 
 R&SB
 Our R&SB segment includes the following voice products:  local lines, primary rate interface (“PRI”), long distance, toll and directory advertising and other voice services (excluding voice over IP (“VoIP”) services, which are typically provided to enterprise customers and are included in our data segment) and the following IP services products: fiber-to-the-premise broadband XL, DSL, integrated access and IPTV video.  These products are sold to residential and small business customers through our competitive local exchange carrier (“CLEC”) and rural local exchange carrier (“RLEC”) networks.  Revenues from our R&SB segment accounted for 30.6%, 32.9% and 35.8% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Despite declining revenues, we expect the cash flows from our legacy businesses to continue to significantly contribute to funding the capital investment in our growing data segment.  As of December 31, 2016, we operated approximately 65,285 CLEC lines and approximately 22,991 RLEC telephone access lines, a portion of which are fiber-fed and have IPTV-based video services and broadband Internet access offering speeds of up to 1 Gigabit.  We also provide high-speed DSL bundled services to customers within this segment.  This segment also includes revenues from switched access services provided to other carriers in our competitive markets. 
 RLEC Access
 Our RLEC access segment provides carrier customers access to our network within our RLEC footprint and primarily includes switched access services.  Revenues from our RLEC access segment accounted for 9.7%, 11.1% and 11.3% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  A significant portion of our RLEC access segment revenues are 

 
4

 
derived from programs funded by regulatory agencies for recovery of revenue loss resulting from intercarrier compensation reform.  We anticipate continuing declines in RLEC access revenues primarily resulting from regulatory actions taken by applicable regulatory authorities as described in the Regulation section below and also due to access line loss.    For detailed financial information about our business segments, see Note 4 in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and for a detailed review of our financial performance and results of operations by business segment, see Part II, Item 7.  Managements’ Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Sales.  We serve our carrier and enterprise customers with our suite of fiber-based data products, which include carrier Ethernet, MPLS, VPN, wavelength and dedicated Internet access.  We have continued to see increased demand for these products across our customer base, particularly as demand for data transport and mobility services grow.  The mission of our sales team is to capitalize on 

 
5

 
this growing demand by offering customized solutions to our carrier and enterprise customers with a continued focus on expanding within our key vertical markets, which include healthcare, education, financial services and government.  Our technical team plays a significant role in our sales approach in order to focus on selling customized, long-term and secure networking and data solutions.  
 Our specialized sales force is organized into carrier and enterprise teams to effectively pursue opportunities. Our carrier sales team is focused on capitalizing on increased bandwidth demand through new long-term FTTC and data transport contracts and bandwidth upgrades and maximizing on-net growth through our carrier end user sales channel. We expect an increasing portion of new enterprise sales over time will be through this sales channel, which provides access to new enterprise customers through strategic partnerships with national carriers to provide fiber bandwidth solutions over our network. Our enterprise sales team is focused on selling in our expansion and edge-out markets and improving enterprise penetration within our existing markets. 
 Our recently expanded markets include Richmond, VA and Norfolk, VA (including the City of Petersburg and the Hampton Roads area).  Our expansion in these markets significantly increases our addressable market for FTTC and enterprise data. We employ in-market sales teams to drive revenue growth in these markets.  In 2016, we hired a Vice President and General Manager with significant sales experience dedicated to leading the recently expanded enterprise sales team for our Richmond and Norfolk markets.
 Marketing.  Our marketing team is primarily focused on driving revenue growth in our data business, particularly in our expansion markets of Richmond, VA and Norfolk, VA, revenue retention in our residential and small business segment and enhancing the overall customer experience. During 2015, we completed a robust market analysis in our existing, expansion and edge-out markets which provided further visibility into our data business growth opportunities and in 2016 we refreshed the market analysis of the expansion markets based on the placement of our fiber within these regions. We have developed and are implementing a comprehensive outreach and lead generation strategy across our footprint. We also continue to implement a multi-phase customer experience enhancement plan that provides deeper customer data visibility internally and enables proactive management of our top customers’ experience.
 Customer Care.  We differentiate our customer care teams so our customer care representatives can provide the highest level of service by specializing in servicing and supporting data customers and residential and small business customers.  We continue to implement our Elite Care and Platinum Care programs, which are designed to provide a higher level of service to our top wireless carrier and enterprise data customers, respectively. Each customer is assigned a dedicated Client Program Manager who assists in proactively managing the customers’ experience and addresses customer issues and opportunities using a cross functional team approach that engages sales, network, service delivery and customer care teams in both pre- and post-sales support. The Client Program Manager is assisted by a Technical Support Manager who focuses on support of network performance. 
 Our Network and Platform
 We have developed a fiber optic network of long-haul fiber, carrier Ethernet and Ethernet rings located primarily in Virginia and West Virginia, and portions of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio and Kentucky.  As of December 31, 2016, our fiber network spanned approximately 10,100 route miles.
 Our integrated fiber transport network allows us to offer a suite of advanced next-generation communications services, including, but not limited to, 100Gbps wavelength services, which provides greater throughput and superior latency performance, multi-site networking, dedicated Internet and MEF 2.0 certified Ethernet solutions, high-speed Internet and VoIP services.  We use a multi-vendor approach, including Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent and Ciena, among others, to deliver high-bandwidth wavelength services directly to end customers as infrastructure for the MPLS Ethernet and high-speed Internet backbone.  Network-to-network interconnection points allow us to engage carrier partners to provide end to end service for carrier and enterprise customers.  We continue to invest in our fiber network to support the deployment of next-generation products and services, expand our addressable market and bring new customers on-net.
 Over the past three years, we have constructed a new MEF certified Carrier Ethernet MPLS/IP fiber overlay network and migrated the majority of our FTTC traffic to this dedicated network.  This overlay network, originally totaling approximately 850 route miles, connects four key markets in our footprint (Pittsburgh, PA, Charleston, WV, Roanoke, VA and Ashburn, VA) and meets carrier class requirements for fast-rerouting, full redundancy and low latency performance.  In 2016, we replicated this network design into our newly constructed FTTC network in our expansion markets of Richmond, VA and Norfolk, VA. Our second network operations center located in Pittsburgh, PA, opened in 2014, is compatible with our FTTC all-IP network overlay.  The Pittsburgh network operations center provides replication of all traditional functions of our existing network operations center located in Waynesboro, VA, including performance surveillance, repair, upgrade and maintenance of our fiber network and redundancy of our business continuity and disaster recovery functions.  Our parallel network operations centers provide technical surveillance of our network using industry leading network management systems.  
 Our local networks consist of central office digital switches, routers, loop carriers and virtual and physical collocations interconnected primarily with fiber facilities. A mix of fiber optic and copper facilities connect our customers with the core network.

Competition 
 We compete with incumbent local exchange carriers (“ILECs”), broadband service providers, incumbent cable operators, and fiber providers and to a lesser extent, CLECs.  We also face competition from potential future market entrants.  In the last several years, we have seen increasing competition from the cable operators and ILECs for metro-Ethernet services to mid-size businesses.  To remain competitive, we position our company as a customer-focused, leading edge provider with a full portfolio of broadband and IP-based services and a differentiation strategy centered on customizable data solutions.
 As a result of the rapid growth in demand for broadband data transport, we expect that our competition will increase from market entrants offering FTTC, metro Ethernet solutions and other high-speed data services, including cable and wireless access.  Our competition includes:

· | ILECs including AT&T, Verizon, Frontier, Windstream and CenturyLink;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | national fiber service providers and CLECs, including Level 3 and Zayo; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | national and regional cable operators, including Comcast, Shentel, Cox, Time Warner Cable and Suddenlink.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 As the RLEC for the western Virginia cities of Waynesboro, Clifton Forge and Covington and portions of the Virginia counties of Alleghany, Augusta and Botetourt, we have competition from cable companies and are subject to competition from wireless carriers.  A portion of residential customers moving into our service area do not purchase landline phone service.  Although CLECs have not entered our incumbent markets to compete with us, it is possible that one or more may enter our markets.  To minimize potential competition in the RLEC markets, we offer fiber-to-the-premise, DSL, video over copper and a variety of bundled services for broadband, voice and video.
 We believe our competitive strengths include our advanced fiber network; our footprint, including contiguous markets, which we believe provides opportunities for growth with a favorable competitive environment relative to first-tier markets; our robust and expanding products and services, including FTTC and metro Ethernet; our disciplined, success-based capital investment strategy aimed at optimizing our capital efficiency and delivering attractive returns; our diverse customer base, our future cash flow visibility from our legacy businesses; and our experienced management team, with deep industry experience and a strong track record of operating and scaling bandwidth infrastructure assets.     Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we employed 564 full-time and two part-time employees. Of these employees, 38 are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires September 20, 2019.  We believe that we have good relations with our employees.

These reports are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Regulation
 The following summary does not describe all present and proposed federal and state legislation and regulations affecting the telecommunications industry.  Some legislation and regulations are currently the subject of judicial proceedings, legislative hearings and administrative proposals which could change the manner in which this industry operates.  Neither the outcome of any of these developments, nor their potential impact on us, can be predicted at this time.  Regulation can change rapidly in the telecommunications industry, and such changes may have an adverse effect on us in the future.  See “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this report. Regulation Overview
 Our communications services are subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local regulation.  Under the federal Communications Act, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) has jurisdiction over interstate and international common carrier services.  Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the FCC has jurisdiction over certain aspects of local interconnection terms and rates between carriers.
 In addition to FCC regulation, our communications services are regulated to different degrees by state public service commissions and by local authorities.  Such local authorities have jurisdiction over public rights-of-way and video and telecommunications franchises. 


 
7

 
Our operations are subject to various federal and state laws intended to protect the privacy of customers who subscribe to our services.  The FCC has regulations that place restrictions on the permissible uses that we can make of customer-specific information, known as Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”), received from subscribers and that govern procedures for release of such information. The Federal Trade Commission’s “Red Flag” rules require that companies develop and implement written Identity Theft Prevention programs.
 Federal Regulation of Interconnection and Interexchange Services
 The Communications Act requires all common carriers to interconnect on a non-discriminatory basis with other carriers, imposes additional requirements on incumbent local exchange carriers (such as our RLEC’s), and imposes even more comprehensive requirements on the largest ILECs.  The large ILECs are required to provide competitors with physical collocation to allow competitors to place qualifying equipment in ILEC central offices; to unbundle some of their services into unbundled network elements (“UNE”) at “forward looking” rates, permit resale of some of their services, provide access to poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way, and to establish reciprocal compensation for the transport and termination of local traffic.  The obligations of the large ILECs to provide these network facilities and services could be altered or removed by new legislation, regulations or court order.
 ILEC operating entities that serve fewer than 50,000 lines are defined as “rural telephone companies” under the Communications Act and are exempt from the additional requirements applicable to the large ILECs unless and until such exemption is removed by the state regulatory body.  Each of our RLEC operations is considered separately and each has this rural telephone company exemption.    
 Intercarrier Compensation Reform    Intercarrier compensation includes regulated interstate and intrastate access charges that we and other RLECs and CLECs receive from long distance carriers for the origination and termination of long distance calls and reciprocal compensation that interconnected local carriers pay to each other for terminating interconnected local wireline calls.
 In 2011, the FCC released a significant order on intercarrier compensation reform.  In the order, the FCC adopted a uniform national bill-and-keep framework (in which carriers do not collect or pay access charges or reciprocal compensation) as the ultimate end state for all telecommunications traffic exchanged between carriers.  The FCC established the $2 billion Connect America Fund (CAF) for RLECs and RLECs now receive support principally through the CAF rather than through intercarrier compensation.  The FCC order permitted ILECs to implement a new charge on end users to partially offset the loss in access charge revenues, the Access Recovery Charge (“ARC”), effective July 1, 2012.  The maximum ARC for residential customers is $3 per month after six years.  Multi-line business customers have their Subscriber Line Charge and ARC combined capped at $12.20 per line. 
 Our RLECs began charging the ARC and began receiving funding from the CAF on July 1, 2012.  Effective July 1, 2013, our RLECs and CLECs reduced their rates for most intrastate access to interstate rates. Effective July 1, 2014, July 1, 2015, and July 1, 2016, our RLECs and CLECS further reduced interstate and intrastate access charges as required by the FCC. 
 Net Neutrality.  
 On March 12, 2015, the FCC released an order reclassifying broadband Internet access service to be a common carrier service subject to regulation under Title II of the Telecommunications Act.  The order took effect on June 12, 2015.  This “net neutrality” order applies to all wireline and wireless providers of broadband Internet access services.  The FCC regulations adopted in the order prohibit blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization by Internet service providers. The net neutrality order also requires providers to disclose certain information to consumers, including rates, fees, and data allowances. To date, the new rules have had no material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 ﻿
 State Regulation of RLEC, CLEC and Interexchange Services
 Most states require wireline telecommunications providers to obtain authority from state regulatory commissions prior to offering common carrier services.  Our two RLEC subsidiaries are certificated as ILECs in Virginia.  As of December 31, 2016, we have subsidiaries certificated as CLECs in Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio and Kentucky. Through a business acquisition in January 2017, we added subsidiaries certificated as CLECs in North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, and Georgia. State regulatory commissions generally regulate RLEC rates for intrastate services and RLECs must file tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices for their intrastate services.  Our RLECs are subject to regulation in Virginia by the State Corporation Commission (“SCC”). Although we file tariffs covering our CLEC services, our rates for such CLEC services generally fluctuate based on market conditions.
 Local Government Authorizations
 Certain governmental authorities require permits to open streets for construction and/or telecommunications franchises to install or expand facilities.  Video franchises are also required for most of our video services.  We obtain such permits and franchises as required.  We hold video franchises in the City of Waynesboro, Botetourt County, City of Lynchburg, portions of the City of Staunton,
