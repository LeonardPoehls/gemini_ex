Syndicore Asia Limited  Video Syndication
 
Syndicore Asia Limited (SAL) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company formed under the laws of Hong Kong. SAL is an online media company that syndicates video in a cloud-based, multimedia conduit serving a growing, global community of content creators, news outlets and leading brands. SAL will be a provider of syndicated video media to news organizations in the Asia Pacific region. In addition, SAL plans to aggregate content from the Asia Pacific region and provide it to news organizations around the world.
 On December 15, 2013, SAL entered into a Distribution Agreement (the Distribution Agreement) with SendtoNews Video, Inc., a British Columbia company (STN). Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, SAL was granted an exclusive license to use, modify, edit, reproduce, distribute, feed, store, communicate, display, and transmit STNs content in the Asia Pacific Territory (the Content). STN is the content provider for various worldwide sporting events. STN would also provide on-going assistance to SAL with regard to technical, administrative, and service-orientated issues relating to the delivery, utilization, transmission, storage and maintenance of the Content.
 On January 20, 2014, SAL entered into a revised Distribution Agreement whereby STN has agreed to provide SAL transferrable rights for the use, reproduction, storage, display, and transmission of certain content subject to pre-approval in writing from STN. In addition, the revised Distribution Agreement includes changes to the revenue sharing terms, and adds a share of advertising revenue directly resulting from aggregated content by SAL within the territory.
 SAL will strive to become a leading digital content provider for the Asia Pacific region, capitalizing on an explosively growing market with local, regional and national content that was previously unavailable in the area. This is a new and exciting market, and offers exciting opportunities for expansion and growth. There is no assurance, however, that SAL will be successful in its efforts.
 On the other side of the distribution chain, we plan to create SALs own proprietary news partnerships to provide guaranteed content distribution in return for a corresponding share of advertising revenues to a news industry looking to supplement their rapidly declining traditional ad revenue with viable digital-age revenue. 
  Digital ad spending is on the rise. It is forecasted to expand from $117.60 billion USD in 2013 to $173.12 billion USD in 2017. (Go-Globe.com)
  The increase in worldwide digital ad spending is led by the Asia-Pacific region and specifically China. 
  China is estimated to reach 33% of the worlds total ad spending by 2017. (Infographic) 
  Branded video content reaches nearly half (46%) of all internet users. More than half of these people (54%) go on to click though to the brands website (Econsultancy)
  80% of internet users recall watching a video ad on a website they visited in the past 30 days; 46% took some action after viewing the ad (Online Publishers Association)
  Video promotion is over 6 times more effective than print and online (b2bmarketing.net)
  Dr. James McQuivey of Forrester Research says a minute of video is worth 1.8 million words
  90% of information transmitted to the brain is visual, and visuals are processed 60,000X faster in the brain than text (3M Corporation & Zabisco)
 Management believes that SALs customers will be willing to pay a premium CPM because:
  The ability to sponsor exclusive, highly sought-after short form video content
  Deep, creative advertising opportunities  other than rudimentary logo/banner overlays and pre-roll
  Premium positioning
  Unprecedented transparency and near real-time performance metrics to evaluate their investment
  Securing sponsorships with related enterprises
  Stronger control over distribution to help target intended audience.
  SAL currently has a mobile app in development and hope to move into that segment of the market. SAL has been engineering its own cutting edge, interactive mobile app for smart phones and tablet use. App functionality will also be targeted to allow user uploads of local content for events that have no rights holders but are of local interest. The market potential for mobile apps is increasing.
  In addition, we also hope to use our website platform and mobile application to expand into other areas of online content such as news clips, amateur video, social media, games or gaming applications, premium direct content sales and live broadcasting. Online applications and mobile platforms may also be used in a multitude of ways including advertising, direct sales, targeted ad campaigns, items or ideas promotions. These online applications allow the SAL the opportunity to diversify into any number of broad spectrum businesses which rely on communicating with a direct audience across a wide spectrum of media platforms.

 Other segments of the market are also benefiting. The high and rapidly increasing popularity of social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are expected to revolutionize the marketing strategies employed in areas such as the pharmaceuticals industry. There, in addition to marketing, an increasing number of pharma players have also begun leveraging these platforms to enhance consumer relationships and improve brand management, based on the market intelligence generated by monitoring and analyzing user-generated content. The ability to incorporate consumer feedback to develop new products is also expected to initiate a strategic shift in the operational model of pharma companies. Social media involvements are expected to increase product sales, especially those of OTC drugs, in the long term. Novartis for instance has already begun using YouTube and Facebook to enhance the sales for its OTC drugs such as Comtrex, Orofar and Bufferin. Johnson &Johnson, one of the first pharma giants to enter the social media space, has used online platforms for crisis management  when the company recalled its products (Tylenol and Benadryl tablets) it used social websites to apologize to consumers for irregularities in its manufacturing plant found during FDA inspection.
 Subsequently, on January 20, 2014, the parties entered into a revised Distribution Agreement whereby STN has agreed to provide SAL transferrable rights for the use, reproduction, storage, display, and transmission of certain content subject to pre-approval in writing from STN.

Green Standard Technologies Enterprises, Inc. (F/K/A Green Standard Technologies, Inc.)  Service Provider to the Cannabis Industry
 
On August 1, 2014 the Company formed Green Standard Technologies, Inc. (F/K/A Green Standard Technologies, Inc.) (GSTE) as a wholly owned incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada. The Companys second line of business is carried on by this subsidiary.
On June 6, 2015, Green Standard Technologies Inc. amended their name to Green Standard Technologies Enterprises, Inc.
 GSTE is in the medical and recreation marijuana industry, and the establishment of a website will be used to further its business by providing customers with medical and recreational marijuana resources. Management believes that this online presence is essential in developing and expanding their existing business.
 On October 29, 2014, GSTE entered into a Website Development Agreement with Social Asylum Inc. (SAI). Under the terms of the Agreement SAI has agreed to provide a fully functioning ecommerce website with unique and proprietary functions according to a mutually agreed upon set of features and milestones for a minimum cost of $150,000; however, the cost could potentially be higher depending on the finalized functionality, scope and details. Also included are plans for launch, market and geographic expansion.
 GSTE is developing software and support solutions for the cannabis industry. The new business model will consist of a website [www.greenNVY.com] and business management software available to cannabis retailers in those states where the sale of cannabis is legal, either for medical purposes or for recreational purposes. The website will provide a platform for cannabis retailers to interface with retail customers. It will also allow for the creation of an online community for retailers and the consumer. The website will feature a clean, uncluttered and professional interface where the consumers can explore menus while researching strains of cannabis and pricing of cannabis from multiple sources. The website will allow consumers to get discounts and coupons, which will encourage them to try new stores. It will contain a geographical target map of the closest cannabis retail locations with a full profile of each retail outlet. In addition, it will contain a social platform which will allow consumers to chat with each other and read and post reviews within the community. In addition, it will create menu searches that can help the consumer quickly locate their favorite type or brand of cannabis products and services.
 For a retailer the website will provide a cloud based business management system that centralizes and automates every aspect of running their business. It will provide encrypted communications through GSTEs proprietary whisper email and instant messaging platform. It will also provide advertising opportunities in order to allow the retailer to develop new customers. The software will also provide the retailer with global applications which outline menu and review information for each retail location. It will provide mobile coupons through proximity marketing, email and text messages. In addition, it will administer customer loyalty programs and customer porting features that include consumers past orders. For the retailers business, it will offer employee management and human resources applications, payroll management, and employee scheduling. It will also offer retailers payment processing, integration and inventory management. The software will also provide the retailer with a sophisticated level of reporting of all the activity in the store, sales reporting by hour, day, etc., and reports of the bestselling products broken down by category, average sale total and spot trends. 
 At the current time, 23 states have legalized the medicinal use of marijuana and another 10 states are currently considering legalization. In addition, 4 states have made recreational use of cannabis legal, and there are several other states considering legalization of recreational use. 
 Revenues will be generated from retailers based on monthly subscriptions to the management software and placement on the website. The fees will depend upon what types of features, functionality, marketing, advertising and exposure retailers with to have. In addition, GSTE will generate revenues from banner and text messages, blast advertising, and proximity marketing of email newsletter ads.
 GSTE is currently in the startup stage and has no earnings to date. Once it becomes fully operational its business will be strictly to provide products and services to the cannabis industry. GSTE will not be involved in the purchase or sale of cannabis products.
 Managements plans to support GSTEs operations by raising funds through the sale of the Companys securities and to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation. If we do not raise all of the money we need from the sale of securities, we will have to find alternative sources, such as loans from our officers, directors or others. If we cant raise enough cash, we will either have to suspend operations until the cash is raised, or cease business entirely.
