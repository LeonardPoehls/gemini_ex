Overview
 We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company passionately committed to the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative antibacterial treatments against multi-drug resistant (“MDR”) gram-negative infections. We are developing plazomicin, our lead product candidate, for the treatment of serious bacterial infections, due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (“CRE”). In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) identified CRE as a “nightmare bacteria” and an immediate public health threat that requires “urgent and aggressive action” and in 2017 the World Health Organization (“WHO”) identified CRE as a Global Priority 1 Pathogen: Critical Need for Research and Development of New Antibiotics. Our second antibacterial candidate is C-Scape, an orally-administered combination of clavulanate and ceftibuten, which targets serious bacterial infections due to expanded spectrum beta-lactamases (“ESBL”) producing Enterobacteriaceae. In 2017, the WHO identified ESBL as a Global Priority 1 Pathogen: Critical Need for Research and Development of New Antibiotics. We also have other programs in early and late preclinical stages focused on other MDR gram-negative infections and additional disease areas.
 On January 2, 2018, we announced the acceptance of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for substantive review to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for plazomicin, seeking approval to treat complicated urinary tract infections (“cUTI”), including acute pyelonephritis (“AP”) and bloodstream infections (“BSI”) due to certain Enterobacteriaceae in patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options. The NDA is supported by data from two Phase 3 clinical trials, EPIC (Evaluating Plazomicin In cUTI) and CARE (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Enterobacteriaceae). The FDA has granted the NDA Priority Review as well as set a target action date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) of June 25, 2018. We expect a commercial launch of plazomicin in the United States in 2018, if our NDA is approved by the PDUFA date. We also intend to submit an application for marketing authorization (“MAA”) in the European Union (“EU”) in 2018. 
 On May 23, 2017, we announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation (“BTD”) for plazomicin for the treatment of BSI caused by certain Enterobacteriaceae in patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options. BTD was created by the FDA to expedite the development and review of drugs that target serious or life-threatening conditions. Plazomicin has also received Qualified Infectious Disease Product (“QIDP”) designation from the FDA, which provides incentives for the development of new antibiotics, including priority review and an extension by an additional five years of any existing non-patent market exclusivity the 
 3


product may be awarded upon approval. We have global commercialization rights to plazomicin, which has patent protection in the United States estimated from 2030 to 2032.
 Plazomicin has been evaluated in two Phase 3 clinical trials, entitled EPIC and CARE. The EPIC study was a Phase 3 trial of plazomicin for the treatment of patients with cUTI and AP and enrolled 609 patients. In the EPIC trial, plazomicin successfully met the objective of non-inferiority compared to meropenem for the FDA-specified primary efficacy endpoints, and achieved superiority for the primary efficacy endpoints specified by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”). Results for the FDA pre-specified composite endpoint of clinical cure and microbiological eradication in the microbiological modified intent-to-treat (“mMITT”) population at Day 5 achieved statistical non-inferiority, and outcomes at the Test-of-Cure (Day ~17) statistically favored plazomicin. Results for EMA-specified endpoints of microbiological eradication at the test-of-cure visit achieved statistical superiority in both the mMITT and microbiologically evaluable (“ME”) populations. Plazomicin was also generally well tolerated with no new safety concerns identified in the EPIC trial. 
 The CARE study was a Phase 3 resistant pathogen trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plazomicin in patients with serious bacterial infections due to CRE.  The CARE trial enrolled 69 patients, comprised of 39 patients enrolled in Cohort 1, comparing plazomicin to colistin-based therapy in patients with BSI infections or pneumonia due to CRE, and 30 patients in Cohort 2, a single arm cohort of plazomicin treatment in patients with serious infections due to CRE who were not eligible for Cohort 1. In Cohort 1 of the CARE trial, a lower rate of mortality at Day 28 or serious disease-related complications was observed for plazomicin compared with colistin therapy. The safety profile of plazomicin was favorable to that of colistin in critically ill patients in the CARE trial.
According to government agencies and physician groups, including the CDC, the Infectious Disease Society of America, and the WHO, one of the greatest needs for new antibiotics is to treat MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including ESBL producing isolates and CRE. CRE leads to mortality rates of up to 50% in patients with BSI. We estimate that there were approximately 180,000 cases of CRE infections in the United States and five major markets in the EU in 2016 including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, which we refer to as the EU 5. Based on the significant increase in resistance rates in recent years, we anticipate CRE will continue to spread and remain a major health problem. Governments, in collaboration with the private sector, have begun to respond by advancing regulatory reform and economic incentives to spur development of new antibiotics.
 Plazomicin is a novel intravenous aminoglycoside antibiotic. Aminoglycosides have been used successfully for the treatment of serious infections for more than 50 years. However, clinical resistance to currently marketed aminoglycosides has increasingly limited their utility. We developed plazomicin by chemically modifying sisomicin, a naturally occurring aminoglycoside, in order to overcome common aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms. In MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including ESBL-producing isolates and CRE, plazomicin remains active where most other antibiotics, including commercially available aminoglycosides, have limited potency due to resistance.
 We consider the following to be key attributes that support the clinical utility and commercial value of plazomicin:
  
• | Potent in vitro and in vivo activity in nonclinical studies against MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including ESBL-producers and CRE.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Activity in the presence of a range of resistance mechanisms, including most aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, fluoroquinolone target site mutations, extended-spectrum β-lactamases, and carbapenemases.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Demonstrated non-inferior (day 5) and statistically favorable (day 17) outcomes compared to meropenem in patients with cUTI/AP infections due to Enterobacteriaceae, including fluoroquinolone-resistant and ESBL-producing isolates, based on results from our Phase 3 EPIC study.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lower rate of mortality and improved safety compared to colistin observed in patients with serious bacterial infections due to CRE, based on results from our Phase 3 CARE study.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to improve dosing strategy, which includes individualized patient dosing using therapeutic drug management (“TDM”), an in vitro drug-monitoring assay, to potentially optimize both the efficacy and safety of plazomicin by dosing to a target drug exposure.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Potential for more convenient administration as a once-daily, 30-minute IV therapy compared to other IV antibiotics administered multiple times per day with infusion times up to three hours. In particular, this supports the potential for plazomicin outpatient therapy. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to reduce the health care costs associated with the treatment of such infections.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In January 2018, we announced positive Phase 1 top-line results for our orally-administered antibacterial candidate, C-Scape, which is a combination of ceftibuten, an approved third generation cephalosporin, and clavulanate, an approved β-lactamase inhibitor. We believe that C-Scape has the potential to address a serious unmet need for an effective oral treatment for patients with cUTI, including AP, caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The Phase 1 top-line results demonstrated that, in healthy subjects, C-Scape was well tolerated across all doses studied, with no drug-drug interactions observed between the previously approved compounds when dosed in combination. These results are supportive of further evaluation and we currently plan to initiate a single pivotal Phase 3 study in patients with cUTI, including AP, who are suitable for treatment with oral antibiotics, in 2018. Our C-Scape program is funded in part by a contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”) for up to $18.0 million, of which $12.0 million is committed. 
 The C-Scape drug combination was granted QIDP designation by the FDA for the treatment of cUTI, including AP, in January 2017. We currently plan to leverage a 505(b)(2) regulatory path to support the potential initiation of a single pivotal Phase 3 trial in 2018.
 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are often resistant to currently available oral therapies. In 2017, the WHO identified ESBL as a Global Priority 1 Pathogen: Critical Need for Research and Development of New Antibiotics. The lack of adequate oral therapies often leads to hospitalization for intravenous therapy. New oral agents with activity against ESBL-producing organisms are needed to reduce hospitalization and reliance on carbapenems. The goal of the C-Scape development program would be to treat certain MDR infections in the outpatient and possibly step-down settings.
 CRE and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are two of many types of MDR gram-negative pathogens threatening patients. Bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii also pose “serious” resistance threats, according to the CDC, and also drive a great need for new, safe, and effective antibiotics. We have assembled the expertise and capabilities required, including chemistry and microbiology, to develop new agents for the treatment of gram-negative infections. Our research and development pipeline includes small molecule and antibody programs that target gram-negative pathogens as well as other disease areas. These programs include our collaboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation which provides for up to $20.5 million in grant funding and equity investments, of which $13.2 million has been committed or invested, to further develop our antibody platform and discover monoclonal antibody candidates against gram-negative bacteria, including those that cause neonatal sepsis.
 Strategy
 Our strategy is to discover, develop, and commercialize new antibacterials for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections. Key elements of our strategy are as follows:
  
• | Obtain regulatory approval of plazomicin in both the United States and the EU. We are seeking approval in the U.S. for plazomicin to treat cUTI, including AP, and BSI due to certain Enterobacteriaceae in patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options. In January 2018, we announced that the FDA has accepted the NDA for substantive review and granted the NDA Priority Review with a PDUFA target action date of June 25, 2018. We also intend to submit a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) to the EMA in 2018.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapidly progress a second antibacterial targeting high unmet need gram-negative infections. We are developing C-Scape, an innovative combination of ceftibuten, an approved third generation cephalosporin, and clavulanate, an approved β-lactamase inhibitor, that we believe could offer a potential oral therapy to treat patients with MDR gram-negative infections such as cUTIs due to ESBL-producing pathogens. The program has positive top-line Phase 1 results and has the potential to enter Phase 3 in 2018. In January 2017, C-Scape received QIDP designation from the FDA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Commercialize our products directly in the United States and through commercialization partners elsewhere. We have global commercialization rights to our leading drug candidates. If approved, we intend to commercialize plazomicin directly using a targeted hospital-based sales force in the United States, where MDR infections, including CRE, are concentrated in resistance hotspots. Outside the United States, we intend to commercialize plazomicin with global and/or regional partners. We seek to collaborate with companies that have an existing commercial presence and experience in targeted geographic markets outside the United States, which we believe would position us to efficiently maximize the commercial potential of our products, including plazomicin.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish and leverage collaborations with non-commercial organizations for scientific expertise and funding support. We collaborate with government agencies and non-profit foundations to support our discovery efforts and advance the product candidates in our pipeline. We have received funding support for both plazomicin and our C-Scape program. We have received $124.3 million in funding under a contract with BARDA for the development of plazomicin. We entered into another BARDA contract for up to $18.0 million of which $12.0 million is committed for the development of C-Scape, with $11.0 million remaining of committed funding available as of December 31, 2017. We have grant funding for up to $10.5 million over a three-year research term and have received a $10 million equity investment from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (the “Gates Foundation”) to support the therapeutic antibody program and the discovery of drug candidates intended to prevent neonatal sepsis. In the past, we have also received funding support from agencies such as the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (“NIAID”), National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”), the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (“CARB-X”) and The Wellcome Trust, a global charitable foundation. We also partner and collaborate with leading academics, scientists, clinicians, public health organizations, and our scientific advisory board to enhance our internal discovery and development expertise, and to jointly sponsor funding proposals.

• | Build a portfolio of differentiated products for the treatment of MDR gram-negative infections and other disease areas. Since we commenced operations in 2004, we have focused on the discovery and development of antibiotics to treat gram-negative infections and have developed proprietary know-how about the relationship between compound structure and potency against gram-negative bacteria through our work on multiple antibiotic classes. We are using this expertise to build a portfolio of product candidates for the treatment of infections due to MDR pathogens. Patients with these infections have limited or inadequate therapeutic options leading to high rates of morbidity and mortality as well as significantly increased healthcare costs. We believe the greatest unmet medical need lies among patients with infections due to MDR gram-negative bacteria, where there is a significant and growing problem and the industry pipeline of drug candidates is limited. In addition, with our research antibody platform, we will selectively explore other therapeutic areas where there is a critical public health need and where we can leverage our expertise to address the unmet need in a unique way.

Antibacterials Background
 Antibacterials, which, for small molecules, we refer to interchangeably as antibiotics, are drugs used to treat infections that are caused by bacteria. The introduction of antibiotics is recognized as one of the most transformative events in medicine. Prior to the introduction of the first antibiotics in the 1930s and 1940s, bacterial infections were often fatal, and invasive surgery was accompanied by a high risk of infectious complications. Today, antibacterials are used routinely to treat and prevent infection. According to IMS Health, antibiotics accounted for $38.6 billion in sales globally in 2016.
 There are two main varieties of bacteria, based on a common laboratory staining test known as the “Gram stain.” Gram-positive bacteria are surrounded by a single lipid membrane and a thick cell wall. Common gram-positive pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus species, and Clostridium difficile. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria are encircled by two lipid membranes, an inner membrane and an outer membrane, with a thinner cell wall in between. Gram-negative bacteria include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and the Enterobacteriaceae, a family of related organisms that includes Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella species. Drugs that act in the cytoplasm of gram-negative bacteria must cross both the inner and outer membranes, whereas drugs that just act on gram-positive bacteria only have to cross one membrane. Each membrane in gram-negative bacteria excludes 
 6


different types of chemical entities, requiring antibiotics that act in the gram-negative cytoplasm to be specifically designed to permeate both membranes.
 Antibiotics are classified according to several criteria:
  
• | Spectrum: Antibiotics that are effective against a wide variety of bacteria, including both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, are considered to be broad-spectrum, while those that act upon only a limited number of species are considered to be narrow-spectrum. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics are most often selected if a specific pathogen is suspected or confirmed.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cidality: Antibiotic action generally falls into two categories: bacteriostatic and bactericidal. Bacteriostatic antibiotics halt the growth of bacteria, relying on the immune system to clear the infection. Bactericidal antibiotics kill the bacterial pathogen directly and are preferred in life-threatening infections and when the patient’s immune system is not functioning optimally.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In vitro microbiological activity: This is the ability of the antibiotic to kill or inhibit growth of bacteria in vitro. In vitro experiments and assays do not take into account the complex interactions that occur in animals or humans, but are relatively easy to perform in the laboratory and usually constitute the extent of routine microbiological testing in hospital laboratories. Potency, which relates drug concentrations to activity, is commonly expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration (“MIC”) in µg/mL, which is the lowest concentration at which the drug inhibits growth of the bacteria. Antibiotics with lower MICs are considered to be more potent.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Susceptibility/non-susceptibility: The relationship between microbiological activity and the clinical utility of an antibiotic to treat a given infection can be described in terms of susceptibility or non-susceptibility. A susceptible MIC value indicates a high probability that an antibiotic can be used to treat a particular infection. A non-susceptible MIC value from in vitro testing suggests the antibiotic is unlikely to be effective against the causative pathogen and thus should only be used under supervision of an infectious disease specialist. An intermediate MIC value suggests there is a slight chance the antibiotic will be effective against the causative pathogen. The MIC values defining susceptibility are established by FDA on approval of new antibiotics and medical standards organizations including the Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute (“CLSI”), and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (“EUCAST”).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Antimicrobial resistance: Resistance generally indicates the inability of an antibiotic to effectively treat an infection at usually administered doses. Some bacteria are naturally resistant to certain types of antibiotics. Resistance can also occur due to genetic mutations or acquisition of exogenous genetic material (e.g., plasmids). Mechanisms responsible for resistance to different antibiotics commonly travel together on mobile elements like plasmids which can transfer and spread between different bacteria, leading to multi-drug resistance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Antibiotics Are Needed for Resistant Gram-negative Infections
 According to the CDC, at least two million people each year in the United States acquire serious infections with bacteria that are resistant to one or more of the antibiotics designed to treat those infections, and each year, over 23,000 patients in the United States die from these infections. In the EU, the annual burden posed by resistant healthcare associated bacterial infections is approximately 2.5 million hospital days and 25,000 deaths. Similar problems exist throughout the world, and the WHO has declared antibiotic resistance a threat to global health security. The development and spread of resistance is driven by the use of antibiotics. Once they arise, resistant bacteria can be transferred between patients and antibiotic resistance mechanisms can be transferred between bacterial species, thus increasing the problem.
 Antibiotic-resistant infections not only cause significant morbidity and mortality, but also place a substantial cost burden on the healthcare system. In most cases, antibiotic-resistant infections require prolonged and/or costlier treatments, extend hospital stays, and necessitate additional doctor visits and healthcare expenditures compared with infections that are easily treatable with antibiotics. The CDC estimates that the excess annual cost resulting from these infections in the United States is as high as $20 billion. According to an estimate from a 2012 study of over 
 7


5,500 U.S. patients, the average incremental per-patient hospital cost for antibiotic-resistant healthcare-associated infections, as compared to antibiotic-susceptible infections, was over $15,000.
 According to government agencies and physician groups such as the CDC and the Infectious Disease Society of America, one of the greatest needs is for new antibiotics to treat infections caused by drug-resistant gram-negative pathogens, including ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, CRE, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. These pathogens are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, as growing antibiotic resistance has left limited effective treatment options. 
 Governments, in collaboration with the private sector, have begun to respond to this significant and growing unmet medical need by creating governmental and non-governmental entities tasked with addressing the problem and progressing legislation for reimbursement and regulatory reform, and economic incentives. In the United States, the federal government has developed a National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria, which outlines Federal activities over the five-year period from 2015 to 2020 designed (i) to enhance domestic and international capacity to prevent and contain outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant infections; (ii) to maintain the efficacy of current and new antibiotics; and (iii) to develop and deploy next-generation diagnostics, antibiotics, vaccines, and other therapeutics. The National Action Plan proposes to accelerate research and development for new antibiotics through a multifaceted approach that includes intensified support for antibiotic product development from the NIH, BARDA, and the DOD’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (“DTRA”). 
Accordingly, the 2018 U.S. federal budget request includes $1.02 billion for BARDA of which $192 million is to support the combating antimicrobial resistant bacteria initiative. The federal government has also established the Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria, a federal advisory committee, which is designed to provide advice, information, and recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on programs and policies related to combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
 On the legislative front, in July 2012, the Federal Drug and Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”) was passed, which included the Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now Act (the “GAIN Act”). The GAIN Act provides incentives for the development of new QIDP, including potential for priority review and the potential for adding five years to the otherwise applicable regulatory exclusivity period. In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”) was passed by Congress and signed into law. This is a significant piece of legislation which is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and spur innovation in biomedical research. Certain sections of the Cures Act support the development of new antibacterials targeting drug-resistant bacterial infections. Of note, the legislation establishes a mechanism to help streamline the development of certain antibacterial and antifungal drugs that are intended to treat serious or potentially fatal infections in limited populations of patients where unmet need exists due to lack of available therapies. Approval of these antimicrobials are expected to rely on data primarily targeting these limited populations, permitting FDA to approve such drugs for limited patient populations, notwithstanding a lack of evidence to fully establish a favorable benefit-risk profile in a population that is broader than the intended limited population. The statement “Limited Population” will appear prominently next to the drug’s name in labeling, which will provide notice to healthcare providers that the drug is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients. The limited population statement, additional labeling statements describing the data, and FDA review of promotional materials, are intended to help assure these drugs are used narrowly to treat these serious and life-threatening infections while additional evidence is generated to assess safety and effectiveness for broader use.

Research and Development Pipeline
 The following table summarizes the status of plazomicin and our other preclinical and research programs:
 

Plazomicin
 Overview
 Our lead product candidate is plazomicin, a next generation aminoglycoside designed by our scientists to overcome the most common aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms, the aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (“AMEs”). Aminoglycosides have been used successfully for the treatment of serious bacterial infections for more than 50 years. As a class, aminoglycosides have several important characteristics including rapid bactericidal activity, well-characterized pharmacokinetics (“PK”), a lack of metabolism in humans, and excellent solubility and stability. However, the spread of resistance to currently marketed aminoglycosides has decreased their clinical utility. We developed plazomicin by chemically modifying an existing aminoglycoside, sisomicin, a natural product isolated from bacteria, to shield the regions of the molecule that are targeted by the enzymes responsible for aminoglycoside resistance. As a result of these modifications, plazomicin has the potential to remain active against MDR organisms where most other major drug classes, including commercially available aminoglycosides such as gentamicin and amikacin, have limited activity. Based on this profile, we are developing plazomicin as an intravenous (“IV”) therapy for the treatment of serious bacterial infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and CRE, which the CDC considers to be among the most serious and urgent resistance threats to public health.
 We consider the following to be key attributes that support the clinical utility and commercial value of plazomicin:
  
• | Met the objective of non-inferiority compared to meropenem in the Phase 3 EPIC trial in patients with cUTI and AP for the FDA-specified primary efficacy endpoint, and achieved superiority for the EMA-specified primary efficacy endpoint. Plazomicin was well tolerated with no new safety concerns identified in this trial. Plazomicin demonstrated non-inferiority to meropenem in our Phase 3 EPIC trial based on the primary efficacy endpoint of combined microbiological eradication and clinical cure for the FDA and was superior to meropenem based on the primary endpoint of microbiological eradication for the EMA. Plazomicin showed comparable or higher cure rates to meropenem in the subgroups of patients with infection caused by ESBL-producing and/or aminoglycoside-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.

The comparator chosen for this study, meropenem, is a member of the carbapenem class of antibiotics. Due to their preserved activity against pathogens resistant to third generation cephalosporins (e.g., ESBL-producing organisms) and other antibiotic classes, carbapenems are considered the last line of defense against MDR gram-negative infections and are thus often reserved to treat such infections. In terms of safety, the overall incidence of treatment emergent adverse events, including serious adverse events, was similar across the plazomicin and meropenem groups. The demonstration of non-inferiority of plazomicin, including against key resistant pathogens, to an agent widely considered to be preferred therapy for MDR infections, combined with a generally favorable safety profile positions plazomicin as a potential alternative to carbapenems in this indication.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A lower rate of mortality or serious disease-related complications was observed for plazomicin compared with colistin therapy in the Phase 3 CARE trial in patients with serious infections due to CRE. Favorable safety profile of plazomicin compared to colistin in a critically ill patient population in CARE trial. In Cohort 1 of CARE, plazomicin-based therapy was associated with a lower rate of 28-day all-cause mortality or serious disease related complications as well as lower 28-day all-cause mortality alone compared to colistin-based therapy in the treatment of CRE BSI and hospital acquired and ventilator associated bacterial pneumonia. By focusing the Phase 3 CARE trial on patients with a high unmet medical need where the efficacy of the currently available therapy is often inadequate, we observed improved outcomes for plazomicin compared with colistin therapy against CRE in the clinical setting. Plazomicin based therapy was also associated with an improved safety profile compared to colistin, including a notable reduction in adverse events related to renal function. The large reduction in mortality combined with improved safety outcomes compared to colistin, a currently available agent for CRE infection, positions plazomicin as a potential new therapeutic option for serious infections due to CRE. Inclusion of a second, single-arm observational cohort (Cohort 2) in the Phase 3 CARE trial that enrolled patients not eligible for the randomized portion of the trial, allowed us to generate additional important data regarding the efficacy and safety of plazomicin as well as the use of TDM in an expanded patient population.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convenient administration as once daily, 30-minute IV therapy. Plazomicin is intended to be administered as an IV infusion once per day for 30-minutes whereas other approved gram-negative IV antibiotics, such as β-lactam antibiotics, are administered multiple times per day with infusion times up to two hours. In particular, if approved, we believe the improved convenience of this administration would facilitate plazomicin for outpatient therapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to reduce the healthcare costs associated with the treatment of serious infections. Treatment of antibiotic-susceptible infections is associated with lower overall costs as compared to the treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections. As demonstrated in our Phase 3 CARE trial, plazomicin was associated with a 33% absolute reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with BSI compared to colistin. Additionally, the survival benefit was sustained through day 60. These data will allow us to model the potential health economic value of plazomicin.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to improve dosing strategy compared to existing aminoglycosides and alternative therapeutic options, and individualized patient dosing using an in vitro assay. We have taken advantage of recent innovations in PK and pharmacodynamic (“PD”) modeling to create a once-a-day dosing regimen that is optimized to achieve the drug exposures projected to be efficacious in treating serious CRE infections. Patient dosing in the Phase 3 CARE trial population was also individualized by using an in vitro drug-monitoring assay to measure levels of plazomicin in the bloodstream and adjusting the dose, if necessary, to achieve the targeted drug exposure in critically ill patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to be used in combination therapy for the treatment of serious infections due to CRE. Combination therapy has become the standard of care for treatment of serious infections due to CRE. Aminoglycoside/β-lactam combinations may be particularly attractive based on in vitro evidence of synergistic bacterial killing and decades of experience in the use of such combinations for the treatment of difficult gram-negative pathogens. We believe in vitro data demonstrating synergistic bacterial killing against CRE with select plazomicin combinations in addition to the clinical data generated with the use of combination therapy in the Phase 3 CARE trial provides support to the use of plazomicin as part of active combination therapies for select patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Potent in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy in nonclinical studies against MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including ESBL-producers and CRE. Plazomicin retains activity in nonclinical studies against clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates possessing β-lactamases including most varieties of carbapenemases, as well as most types of resistance to other key antibiotics, including commercially available aminoglycosides, colistin, and tigecycline.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that plazomicin has the potential to become a new standard of care for the treatment of CRE, based on the attributes outlined above.
 Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae Pose an Urgent Threat to Patients
 The need for new antibiotics to treat CRE is particularly acute, as CRE are one of the top global threats in infectious disease. In 2013, the CDC labeled CRE as a “nightmare bacteria” and indicated that CRE pose a public health threat requiring “urgent and aggressive action.” These bacteria are commonly MDR, exhibiting resistance not only to carbapenems, but also to most antibiotics commonly used to treat gram-negative infections, including cephalosporins, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, fluoroquinolones, and currently-marketed aminoglycosides. Resistance to carbapenems has been highlighted because these drugs are one of the last lines of defense against resistant gram-negative infections. Most CRE express enzymes called carbapenemases which break down the carbapenem antibiotic molecule before it can kill the bacteria. Due to the lack of effective therapies, CRE infections are associated with significant mortality, with up to 50% mortality observed in patients with BSI and greater than 70% in patients with cancer or receiving a liver transplant.
 With limited treatment options available for CRE infections, physicians have resorted to drugs such as colistin and tigecycline, or more recently approved agents such as ceftazidime-avibactam or meropenem-vaborbactam with limited clinical data in CRE. However, there is evidence that these antibiotics are failing patients. For example, in BSI due to carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae, all-cause mortality for treatment with colistin, tigecycline, or combinations of antibiotics that do not include a carbapenem active in vitro against the infecting isolate were reported to be 46%, 47%, and 37%, respectively. Recently, resistance to even these last-resort treatments has begun to be reported, further increasing the urgency for new therapeutic options.
 The CRE problem is global and the incidence has increased significantly over the last decade. We estimate that there were approximately 180,000 cases of CRE infections in the United States and the EU5 in 2016, of which 70,000 to 80,000 were in the United States. We believe that CRE incidence will continue to increase in the future. A key driver of resistance growth, the use of carbapenems, is increasing. Once restricted in use to limit the emergence of resistance, hospitals are changing their policies due to the pressing need for carbapenems to treat the growing number of MDR infections. For example, ESBL-producing bacteria now account for over 18% of E. coli cultured from urine in the United States. This has led to carbapenems being used in 350,000 cases of UTI infection in 2014 up from 72,000 a decade ago. Two-thirds of U.S. hospital pharmacy directors reported that carbapenems are now unrestricted on their hospital formularies, likely a reflection of the increasing incidence of difficult-to-treat gram-negative infections. Additionally, the spread of CRE among patients, between healthcare facilities, and across geographic regions is exacerbated by the ability of Enterobacteriaceae to readily transfer their resistance genes from one bacterium to another. Especially concerning is the potential of CRE to spread in the outpatient setting, which could lead to an epidemic of community-based CRE infections. 
 Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae Pose a Serious Threat to Patients
 The need for new antibiotics to treat ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae is high, as these bacteria have become widespread globally in both healthcare-associated and community-onset infections and the use of carbapenems to treat infections caused by these organisms is felt to be contributing to the rise in CRE. In 2013, the CDC indicated that ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae pose a serious concern to public health threat requiring “prompt and sustained action.” Similar to CRE, these bacteria are commonly MDR, exhibiting resistance not only to extended spectrum cephalosporins but also to fluoroquinolones, and currently-marketed aminoglycosides. In many cases the remaining treatment option is a carbapenem and use of carbapenems to treat these infections is thought to be contributing to increased carbapenem resistance. We estimate that there were greater than 600,000 cases of hospital treated infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the United States in 2016. Infections caused by these organisms are associated with significant mortality; patients with BSI caused by ESBL-producing 
 11


Enterobacteriaceae are approximately 57% more likely to die than those with BSI caused by a non ESBL-producing strain.
 Commercial Strategy for Plazomicin
 Our overall goal is to establish plazomicin as the standard of care for the treatment of serious bacterial infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including CRE. Our strategy is intended to support plazomicin’s differentiated profile from both approved and development-stage antibacterials. Our clinical development program is focused on the treatment of serious bacterial infections due to Enterobacteriaceae in patients with limited or no alternative treatment options.  The submission of an NDA to the FDA for plazomicin, seeking approval to treat cUTI, including AP, and BSI due to certain Enterobacteriaceae in patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options, was accepted by the FDA and granted NDA Priority Review as well as a PDUFA target action date of June 25, 2018. The NDA is supported by data from two Phase 3 clinical trials, EPIC and CARE. 
 Given the lack of effective therapeutic options and the increasing rates of gram-negative infections such as CRE and those caused by ESBL-producing bacteria, we believe the commercial opportunity for plazomicin is significant. We anticipate that the effectiveness of plazomicin in our Phase 3 program, along with extensive data describing plazomicin’s microbiological activity and PK/PD properties, will create significant physician demand for plazomicin based on our primary market research. A demonstrated efficacy and safety benefit versus colistin in a patient population with a high risk of death due to CRE infections, and favorable outcomes compared to a carbapenem in treating cUTI/AP, will be key product differentiators that drive adoption.
 If approved, we expect that the pricing and reimbursement for plazomicin will reflect the strong clinical data and the lack of effective treatment options for gram-negative infections such as CRE and ESBL-producing bacteria. At a 2013 forum sponsored by The Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonprofit organization, which brought together payors, the FDA, and industry representatives, panelists indicated support for an approximate price point of $15,000 per course of therapy for new antibacterial agents for resistant infections as long as clinical and economic benefits were clearly demonstrated. For comparison, recently launched ceftazidime-avibactam and meropenem-vaborbactam currently cost approximately $1,000 per day reflecting a course of therapy from $10,000 to $14,000.
 If approved, we expect physicians to consider using plazomicin for definitive treatment of patients with MDR gram-negative pathogens, including CRE and ESBL-producing pathogens, as well as for empiric treatment, or treatment prior to definitive confirmation of the pathogen, of patients who are at risk of CRE. Definitive treatment for CRE begins when the infecting pathogen has been confirmed as CRE. Length of therapy with plazomicin was 5-7 days in EPIC for cUTI and 7-14 days for patients with either BSI or pneumonia. 
 We estimate that there were approximately 180,000 cases of confirmed CRE infections in the United States and the EU 5 in 2016 of which 70,000 to 80,000 were in the United States. Given the importance of providing effective CRE therapy as soon as possible in order to reduce the risk of death, if approved, we believe physicians will consider using plazomicin empirically to treat patients who are at a high risk of CRE infection and at hospitals with high rates of CRE. Empiric treatment continues until the pathogen is confirmed, which typically takes 2 to 3 days. Following pathogen confirmation, definitive treatment begins either with the same drug(s) used for empiric treatment or with different drug(s), depending on numerous factors including the identity and susceptibility of the pathogen, as well as patient response to empiric therapy. We estimate the total number of cUTI, pneumonia or BSI diagnosed in the United States and EU 5 was approximately 11.0 million in 2016. This smaller subset of empirically treated patients is a more relevant population in which plazomicin might be prescribed to provide empiric treatment for CRE, depending on a number of CRE risk factors, including patient colonization with CRE and high incidence of CRE in the hospital unit.
 If approved, we intend to focus our initial commercial efforts on the U.S. market, which we believe represents the largest single market opportunity for plazomicin. We plan to use a targeted U.S. sales force to promote plazomicin to hospital-based healthcare professionals where MDR infections, including CRE, are concentrated in resistance hotspots, including New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago, and other major population centers. In key markets outside of the United States, including Europe, Asia, and Latin America, we currently believe we can expand the value of plazomicin through collaborating with one or more global or regional commercialization partners who have local market expertise.

Plazomicin Development Program
 We are developing plazomicin, our lead product candidate, for the treatment of serious bacterial infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae in patients with limited or no alternative treatment options. These include patients with cUTI, including AP, due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including ESBL-producing isolates and CRE. In our Phase 3 EPIC study in patients with cUTI, including AP, plazomicin successfully met FDA- and EMA-specified primary efficacy endpoints and was well tolerated with no new safety concerns, providing evidence of efficacy and safety of plazomicin in this indication. In our other Phase 3 study (CARE) in patients with serious infections due to CRE, a lower rate of mortality or serious disease-related complications was observed for plazomicin compared with colistin therapy and the safety profile of plazomicin was favorable compared to that of colistin. 
 In 2012, the FDA granted fast-track designation for the development and regulatory review of plazomicin to treat serious and life-threatening CRE infections. In 2014, plazomicin received QIDP designation from the FDA. The QIDP designation was created by the GAIN Act, which was part of the FDASIA and provides certain incentives for the development of new antibiotics, including eligibility for priority review and an extension of five years to an existing period of non-patent market exclusivity. 
 In 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for plazomicin in patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options for the treatment of BSI caused by certain Enterobacteriaceae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes. The FDA has accepted the NDA for substantive review and has granted the NDA Priority Review as well as set a PDUFA target action date of June 25, 2018. We expect a commercial launch of plazomicin in the United States in 2018, if our NDA is approved by the PDUFA date. We also plan to submit an application for marketing authorization in the EU in 2018. 
 Key elements of our clinical development program for plazomicin are outlined in the table below:
 
 
 | Completed Phase 3 Clinical Studies | 
Study/Phase | Objectives | NumberEnrolled
EPIC/ 3 | Primary: Demonstrate the non-inferiority of plazomicin compared with meropenem based on the difference in composite microbiological eradication and clinical cure rate in the microbiological modified intent-to-treat (mMITT) population at both the Day 5 and test-of-cure (TOC) visits in patients with cUTI and AP Secondary : Safety, PK of plazomicin | 609 
CARE - Cohort 1/ 3 | Primary: Evaluate the efficacy of plazomicin as compared to colistin with respect to all-cause mortality or significant disease-related complications at 28 days in patients with serious CRE infections Secondary: Safety, PK of plazomicin | 39 
CARE - Cohort 2/ 3 | Exploratory: Evaluate the efficacy, safety and PK of plazomicin in patients with serious CRE infections | 30

Completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 Clinical Studies
----------------------------------------------
StudyNo. | Objectives | NumberEnrolled | Key Result 
001 | Phase 1 trial of safety and PK after single and multiple doses in healthy subjects | 39 | Plazomicin was well tolerated at doses of up to 15 mg/kg for 3 days. 
003 | Phase 1 trial of safety, plasma PK and lung penetration in healthy subjects | 40 | Plazomicin was well tolerated at doses of up to 15 mg/kg for 5 days. Plazomicin penetrated into the lung to a similar degree as other aminoglycosides.

011 | Phase 1 study to evaluate the drug-drug interaction potential between plazomicin and metformin in healthy subjects | 16 | Plazomicin is not an in vivo inhibitor of organic cation transporter 2 (OCT-w) or multidrug and toxin extrusion 2K (MATE-2K) 
002 | Phase 2 safety, efficacy, and PK in patients with cUTI | 145 | Plazomicin displayed efficacy similar to the comparator antibiotic treatment (levofloxacin). Plazomicin was generally well tolerated at doses of up to 15 mg/kg for 5 days.

 
Phase 3 EPIC Trial of Plazomicin for the Treatment of cUTI
 Our Phase 3 EPIC trial was a randomized, multicenter, multinational, double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of plazomicin compared with meropenem in the treatment of cUTI, including AP, in adults, and allowed an optional switch to oral therapy. We compared plazomicin 15 mg/kg IV given once daily to meropenem 1.0 gram IV every eight hours with the option to switch to open-label levofloxacin after a minimum of four days of blinded IV study drug to complete a total of 7 to 10 days of therapy (IV plus oral). The trial was designed to show that plazomicin was non-inferior to meropenem based on the FDA primary endpoint of composite clinical and microbiological cure and the Day 5 and TOC visits and the EMA primary endpoint of microbiological eradication at the TOC visit in the mMITT and ME populations. We enrolled 609 patients in the EPIC trial. Plazomicin successfully met the objective of non-inferiority compared to meropenem for the FDA-specified primary efficacy endpoint, and achieved superiority for the EMA-specified primary efficacy endpoint. Results for the FDA pre-specified composite endpoint of clinical cure and microbiological eradication in the mMITT population were as follows: Day 5: 88.0% plazomicin vs. 91.4% meropenem (difference –3.4%, 95% confidence interval (“CI”): –10.0% to 3.1%), indicating non-inferiority; and Test-of-Cure: 81.7% plazomicin vs. 70.1% meropenem (difference 11.6%, 95% CI: 2.7% to 20.3%), indicating statistically favorable outcomes for plazomicin compared to meropenem. Results for EMA-specified endpoints of microbiological eradication at the test-of-cure visit were as follows: mMITT: 87.4% plazomicin vs. 72.1% meropenem (difference 15.4%, 95% CI: 7.5% to 23.2%), indicating statistical superiority; microbiologically evaluable (“ME”): 90.5% plazomicin vs. 76.6% meropenem (difference 13.9%, 95% CI: 6.3% to 21.7%), indicating statistical superiority.  Consistent with the overall results of the primary endpoint at the TOC visit, plazomicin showed comparable or higher cure rates to meropenem in the subgroups of patients with infection caused by ESBL-producing, aminoglycoside-resistant, and/or CRE. These results demonstrate the potential utility of plazomicin as treatment for cUTI, including AP, where treatment options are limited and help to position plazomicin as an alternative to carbapenems in the treatment of urinary tract infections due to ESBL-producing and other MDR gram-negative pathogens.
 Plazomicin was well tolerated with no new safety concerns identified in the EPIC trial. Total treatment emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) related to renal function were reported in 3.6% and 1.3% of patients in the plazomicin and meropenem groups, respectively. TEAEs related to cochlear or vestibular function were reported in 
 14


a single patient in each of the plazomicin and meropenem treatment groups. Both events were considered mild and resolved completely. 
 The first patient in our global Phase 3 EPIC trial for the treatment of cUTI and AP was enrolled in January 2016 and enrollment was closed in August 2016 with 609 patients. Top-line results were announced December 2016 and the FDA accepted the NDA for substantive review with a PDUFA target action date of June 25, 2018. We expect a commercial launch of plazomicin in the United States in 2018 if our NDA is approved by the PDUFA date. We also intend to submit an application for marketing authorization in the EU in 2018.
 Phase 3 CARE Trial of Plazomicin for the Treatment of CRE
 Our Phase 3 CARE (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Enterobacteriaceae) trial was a resistant pathogen-specific trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plazomicin in patients with serious bacterial infections due to CRE. The study consisted of two cohorts of patients: 

• | Cohort 1 – a randomized, comparator-controlled cohort to compare plazomicin 15 mg/kg IV once daily with colistin 300 mg loading dose followed by 5 mg/kg divided every eight hours or every twelve hours (each in combination with adjunctive meropenem or tigecycline) for the treatment of blood stream infections (“BSI”), or Hospital-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (“HABP”)/Ventilator-Associated Bacterial Pneumonia (“VABP”)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cohort 2 – a single-arm observational cohort to evaluate plazomicin 15 mg/kg IV once daily in combination with adjunctive antibiotic therapy (investigator’s choice) in patients with BSI or HABP/VABP (who are not eligible for enrollment in Cohort 1); and to evaluate plazomicin monotherapy, followed by optional oral step-down therapy, in patients with cUTI, including AP 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The purpose of Cohort 2 was to allow access to plazomicin therapy for patients who were not eligible for enrollment in Cohort 1 and who had limited alternative treatment options available. This cohort includes two relatively distinct patient populations: 1) patients with colistin-resistant CRE or polymicrobial infections involving additional Gram-negative pathogens and thus higher anticipated mortality than patients enrolled in Cohort 1, and 2) those with low Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores (< 15) and relatively less severe infection types (e.g. cUTI and AP) and thus lower anticipated overall mortality than patients enrolled in Cohort 1.
 Dosing of plazomicin in our Phase 3 CARE trial was individualized for each patient based on TDM. The use of TDM for currently marketed aminoglycosides has been shown to help achieve target drug exposures, leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced length of hospital stays. To support TDM, plazomicin plasma concentrations were determined using an investigational in vitro assay. In November 2013, we received an Investigational Device Exemption approval from the FDA for use of the assay in the trial.
 We closed enrollment in the CARE study in August 2016 with 69 patients; 39 patients with BSI or HABP/VABP due to CRE were randomized to Cohort 1 and 30 patients with BSI, HABP/VABP or cUTI due to CRE were enrolled in Cohort 2.
 In Cohort 1 of the CARE trial, a lower rate of mortality or serious disease-related complications was observed for plazomicin compared with colistin therapy. Results from Cohort 1 of the CARE trial were as follows: Day 28 all-cause mortality or significant disease related complications (primary endpoint): 23.5% plazomicin vs. 50.0% colistin (difference 26.5%, 90% CI: –0.7% to 51.2%); Day 28 all-cause mortality: 11.8% plazomicin vs. 40.0% colistin (difference 28.2%, 90% CI: 0.7% to 52.5%). Results from Cohort 2 of the CARE trial were as follows: Day 28 all-cause mortality or significant disease related complications: 39.1%; Day 28 all-cause mortality: 26.1%. The majority of deaths occurred in patients with additional Gram-negative pathogens (Acinetobacter or Pseudomonas), a condition excluded from Cohort 1. Two of four cUTI patients in Cohort 2 had clinical and microbiological cure at the TOC visit.
 The safety profile of plazomicin was favorable compared to that of colistin in the acutely ill patient population enrolled in the CARE trial. Study drug-related TEAEs related to renal function were reported in 16.7% and 38.1% of patients in the plazomicin and colistin groups of Cohort 1, respectively. No TEAEs related to cochlear or vestibular function were reported in either group. However, due to the clinical status of patients enrolled in the trial who were 
 15


frequently ventilated and unconscious, planned assessments of hearing and tinnitus were not possible for many of the patients. In Cohort 2, study drug-related TEAEs related to renal function were reported in 13.3% of patients and no TEAEs related to cochlear or vestibular function were reported.
 Research and Development Programs
 Beyond our plazomicin program, the research and development teams are focused on discovering novel medicines for serious unmet medical needs. We have assembled a well-balanced portfolio of small molecule and antibody programs. Our small molecule programs focus on our core areas of expertise in gram-negative antibacterial discovery and development.  Our antibody portfolio is a blend of infectious disease programs and non-infectious disease programs that are well suited for our innovative antibody discovery methods.  We continue to attract key talent and leadership within our research and early development organization to enable efficient transition of molecules from discovery through Phase 1. In addition to our strong internal expertise, we have a long history of engaging world-class research and clinical experts across academia and industry to increase the likelihood of success of our research programs. We also maintain active collaborations with academic research groups to enable the rapid flow of cutting edge science into biotechnology translation. Additional detailed information regarding our C-Scape program is included below, as well as information regarding our research programs. 
C-Scape Development Program
 Between 10% and 30% of clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates in the United States and EU produce ESBLs, rendering them resistant to all β-lactam antibiotics except for carbapenems. The majority of these isolates are also resistant to all oral therapy options for serious infections, including fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cephalosporins. Consequently, the use of carbapenems is increasing rapidly; for instance, in 2009, 100,000 patients hospitalized for a cUTI in the United States received a carbapenem and in 2014 over 350,000 patients received a carbapenem. In the setting of cUTI, including AP, physicians are faced with a dilemma of treating a patient empirically with oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting, which risks treatment failure in a significant proportion of cases, or admitting the patient to the hospital for intravenous carbapenem therapy, which in many cases is an inappropriate use of a “last-line” antibiotic therapeutic option. A new oral antibiotic is needed to reduce the burden and cost of hospitalization, spare carbapenem use, reduce the complications associated with the use of IV catheters, and minimize the risk of oral antibiotic treatment failure. To address this unmet medical need, we are developing C-Scape, a fixed-dose oral combination of two FDA-approved agents: ceftibuten, a third-generation cephalosporin, and clavulanate, a β-lactamase inhibitor, for the treatment of adult patients with cUTI caused by Enterobacteriaceae, including ESBL-producing and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, where limited oral treatment options exist currently. 
 C-Scape is potent against the target pathogens. In a panel of 387 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae from hospitalized patients with UTIs in the U.S. and EU (2014-2015), C-Scape achieved an MIC90 of 1 µg/mL. Moreover, in vitro time-kill experiments have shown that C-Scape is rapidly bactericidal against ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Based on these data the FDA granted C-Scape a QIDP designation in January 2017. 
 We believe that C-Scape has the potential to rapidly address a serious unmet need for an effective oral treatment for patients with cUTI, including AP, caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Both ceftibuten and clavulanate have been previously approved by the FDA, therefore we expect C-Scape to qualify for the 505(b)(2) NDA regulatory pathway for the combination product, which would permit the application to rely in part on the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for each compound alone, and FDA’s guidance for Antibacterial Therapies for Patients with Unmet Medical Need for the Treatment of Serious Bacterial Diseases. We conducted a Phase 1 multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study during the second half of 2017. The Phase 1 results are being evaluated in conjunction with existing human pharmacokinetic data and newly generated nonclinical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data to inform dose selection for a Phase 3 study. We intend to initiate a single pivotal Phase 3 study in patients with cUTI, including AP, who are suitable for treatment with oral antibiotics, in 2018. If successfully developed and approved, we anticipate C-Scape may be eligible for three years of new clinical investigation exclusivity under the Hatch Waxman Act, with an additional five years of non-patent exclusivity conferred by QIDP designation. C-Scape is funded, in part, with Federal funds from BARDA, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, Office of the Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under Contract No. HHSO100201700021C.

The C-Scape Phase 1 clinical trial was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to assess the safety, tolerability and clinical pharmacology of C-Scape, administered orally, in 41 healthy subjects. An overview of the clinical trial data is as follows:
  
• | The combination of ceftibuten and clavulanate was well tolerated when administered for 14 days across all dosing regimens tested.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No serious adverse events (“SAEs”), grade 3 or 4 adverse events, or adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug were observed.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety profile was consistent with expectations for ceftibuten and clavulanate when administered based on existing product labels.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The most commonly reported adverse events included vascular access site bruising, headache, diarrhea, gastroenteritis and nausea. The incidence of each of the most common adverse events was comparable between the active treatment groups and placebo.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preliminary PK following administration of ceftibuten and clavulanate in combination were similar to those following administration of each compound alone, indicating no drug-drug interaction between ceftibuten and clavulanate.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We continue to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetic data and plan to present these at an upcoming scientific and/or investor meeting.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Therapeutic Antibody Discovery Program
  
• | Antibacterial monoclonal antibodies: Our antibody discovery platform aims to generate antibodies that can treat infections caused by MDR gram-negative pathogens. We have built an antibody discovery platform that allows the rapid identification of rare antibodies that disrupt bacterial membrane biogenesis, leading to bacterial cell death. The platform leverages recent advances in microfluidics, single B cell antibody cloning, and our deep expertise in bacterial genetics, to directly screen millions of single B cells for functional bactericidal antibodies within hours, making rare functional antibody discovery possible. This antibody discovery platform is currently funded, in part, by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other monoclonal antibody programs: In May 2016, we announced that we entered a collaboration and license agreement with Crystal Bioscience (now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ligand Pharmaceuticals) to identify and develop therapeutic antibodies against multiple novel targets. We are using Crystal Bioscience’s humanized chicken platform to seek to identify therapeutic antibodies to validated human targets that have proved difficult to target utilizing traditional antibody discovery methods in mice. We have initiated antibody discovery efforts on three targets under this agreement.

Other Small Molecule Development Programs 
 We continue to work on several research programs related to antibiotics directed against gram-negative MDR bacterial infections in our research group.  In November 2017, we announced that we discontinued our work on one of these programs, the LpxC inhibitor research and development efforts, due in part to toxicity of the compounds we were evaluating.  Other than the wind-down of these efforts, we do not expect to continue work on LpxC inhibitors at this time.  
 Government and Non-Profit Foundation Contracts and Grants
 Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (the “Gates Foundation”)
 Our therapeutic antibody program utilizes a built-for-purpose discovery platform to identify and develop monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of MDR bacterial infections and other significant unmet medical needs. To further support that program, we entered into a research agreement with the Gates Foundation on May 4, 2017 to discover drug candidates against gram-negative bacterial pathogens intended to prevent neonatal sepsis in developing countries. Pursuant to the Grant Agreement, the Gates Foundation awarded us up to approximately $10.5 
 17


million in grant funding (“Grant Funds”) over a three-year research term, of which approximately $3.2 million was received in May 2017 (the “Advanced Funds”). As of December 31, 2017, $1.1 million has been recorded as revenue. Concurrently with the Grant Agreement, we entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Gates Purchase Agreement”) with the Gates Foundation, pursuant to which we agreed to sell 407,331 shares of our contingently redeemable common stock (the “Shares”) on May 5, 2017 to the Gates Foundation in a private placement at a purchase price per share equal to $24.55, for gross proceeds of $10.0 million (the “Gates Investment”).
 In connection with the Grant Agreement and the Gates Investment, on May 4, 2017, we entered into a strategic relationship with the Gates Foundation (the “Letter Agreement”), pursuant to which we agreed to use the proceeds from the Gates Investment and Grant Funds only to, among other things, conduct mutually agreed upon work, including the discovery of monoclonal antibody candidates targeting Acinetobacter baumannii with the goal of discovering drug candidates that can be administered to neonates at birth to protect against early and late onset neonatal sepsis in developing countries. We are responsible for all technical and research development activities under a scope of work proposed by us and accepted by the Gates Foundation. In addition, we agreed to publish or make the product and information from the program available and accessible at an affordable price to people in need within certain developing countries, and at the request of the Gates Foundation we will grant the Gates Foundation a non-exclusive license to commercialize selected drug candidates in certain developing countries, which may only be exercised in the event of certain defaults described in a letter agreement between the Gates Foundation and us (the “Global Access Commitments”). The Global Access Commitments will continue in effect until the earlier of 25 years from the closing of the Gates Investment or 7 years following the termination of all funding provided by the Gates Foundation, provided that the Global Access Commitments will continue for any products or services developed with funding provided by the Gates Foundation which continue to be developed or available in certain developing countries.
 If we default in our obligation to conduct certain mutually-agreed upon work or use the proceeds from the Gates Investment as described in the Letter Agreement, or otherwise trigger certain other events of default as described in the Letter Agreement, subject to a cure period, the Gates Foundation will have the right to request that (a) the Company redeem, or facilitate the purchase by a third party of the Shares then held by the Gates Foundation at a price per share equal to the greater of (i) the fair market value of the common stock (if the Shares are freely tradable, the closing price of our common stock on the trading day prior to the redemption or purchase, as applicable), or (ii) an amount equal to $24.55 plus a compounded annual return of 5% from the date of issuance of the Shares, or (b) if the Shares then held by the Gates Foundation are not freely tradable, we will register the resale of the Shares held by the Gates Foundation on an effective registration statement, subject to certain conditions and qualifications.
 Payments under the Grant Agreement with the Gates Foundation are based on milestone, target or reporting deliverables. Payments are based on direct program costs incurred or committed plus an indirect overhead fee. The Advance Funds are replenished by the Gates Foundation each calendar year, or sooner, following our submission of a progress report, including expenses expected to be incurred for the research activities. The Grant Funds are restricted for mutually agreed upon work under the Grant Agreement and are required to be kept in a separate account. If the Gates Foundation terminates the agreement based on the term in the Grant Agreement, we are obligated to return any unused or committed Grant Funds.
 Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”)
 Our program to develop plazomicin for the treatment of serious bacterial infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including CRE, as well as for disease caused by certain bacterial biothreat pathogens, was partially funded under a contract with BARDA (“BARDA-plazo Contract”), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This contract was awarded in August 2010 and consists of a base amount as well as four options, all of which have been exercised. The base amount and the four-exercised options total $124.3 million of obligated funding, of which a total of $124.3 million has been recorded as revenues as of December 31, 2017. 
 Overall, the BARDA-plazo Contract calls for the development, manufacturing, nonclinical and clinical evaluation of, and regulatory filings for, plazomicin as a countermeasure for diseases caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens. These pathogens include bacteria associated with serious hospital-acquired infections, such as CRE, as well as biothreats, such as F. tularensis, which causes tularemia, and Y. pestis, which causes plague. As the prime 
 18


contractor, we are responsible for all technical and regulatory activities under a research plan proposed by us and accepted by BARDA. 
 Our program to develop C-Scape, a product candidate to treat serious bacterial infections due to ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae, is also partially funded under a contract with BARDA. In September 2017, we were awarded the C-Scape Contract (“BARDA C-Scape Contract”) which includes a base period with obligated funding of $12.0 million and subsequent option periods that, if exercised, would bring the total value of the award to $18.0 million. Through December 31, 2017, we have recorded $1.0 million to revenue, with $11.0 million remaining available from the funding currently committed under the C-Scape Contract.
 Payments under the BARDA-plazo and BARDA C-Scape Contracts, collectively (“the BARDA contracts,”) are made in installments as activities are conducted in accordance with the research plan. Payments to us are based on direct costs incurred and allowances for overhead, plus a fee, where applicable. From time to time, we may propose a change to the research plan to BARDA, and BARDA may or may not choose to accept the change to the research plan, along with any associated additional costs, subject to the availability of funding, as well as other factors. We are also obligated under the contract to satisfy various federal reporting requirements, including technical reporting with respect to our plazomicin and C-Scape development activities, reporting with respect to intellectual property and financial reporting. In addition, technical documents and regulatory filings may be reviewed by BARDA prior to their finalization and/or submission.
 Under standard government contracting terms, the government receives only limited rights for government use of certain of our pre-existing data and certain data produced with non-federal funding, to the extent such data are required for delivery to BARDA under the project. The U.S. government receives unlimited rights to use and disclose new data first produced under the project with BARDA funding. The U.S. government is entitled to a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to practice or have practiced any patent on an invention that is conceived or first reduced to practice under the project, and may obtain additional rights if we do not elect to retain ownership of a subject invention or if we do not satisfy certain disclosure and patent prosecution obligations with respect to a subject invention. The government’s rights do not include the composition of matter patents related to plazomicin or C-Scape, as these were developed and prosecuted prior to our entry into the BARDA contracts and without government funding. The BARDA contracts do not entitle the government to any sales royalties or other post-commercialization financial rights.
 BARDA is entitled to terminate either contract for convenience at any time provided reasonable closeout costs are paid and is not obligated to provide funding beyond currently obligated amounts allotted from Congressionally appropriated funds.
 For more information regarding the government contracts referred to above see “Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our U.S. Government Contracts and to Certain Grant Agreements” and “Risk Factors--Risks Related to Intellectual Property.” Provisions in our U.S. government contracts, including our contract with BARDA, and certain grant agreements, including our collaboration with the Gates Foundation, may affect our intellectual property rights. As is customary under many government-funded research grants and contracts with foundations, including our collaboration with the Gates Foundation, we may not have sole rights to certain intellectual property and, in specific situations, could share or lose the rights we do have. 
 Commercial Agreements
 License Agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)
 On January 25, 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Ionis”), pursuant to which Ionis granted us an exclusive license under certain patents relating to aminoglycoside antibacterial compounds and related know-how to develop and commercialize certain novel aminoglycoside antibacterial compounds. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize certain compounds under the agreement. In consideration for the rights granted to us by Ionis under the license agreement, we issued $1.5 million of our Series A convertible preferred stock to Ionis in 2006. In addition, we are required to make payments to Ionis upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones totaling up to $19.5 million for the first aminoglycoside product developed under certain terms of the agreement. We paid $4.0 million to Ionis in the fourth quarter of 2014 following dosing the first patient in our Phase 3 CARE trial of plazomicin in September 2014 and could owe up to $9.75 million for a second aminoglycoside product, if any, 
 19


developed under this agreement. The agreement requires us to pay Ionis a low double-digit share of non-royalty sublicensing revenues that we receive from certain sublicensees for the grant of sublicenses under our agreement with Ionis, provided that the maximum amount we are required to pay Ionis with respect to the sum of all development and regulatory milestones and non-royalty sublicensing revenue payment obligations for plazomicin, but only to the extent it qualifies as the first aminoglycoside product under the agreement, is $19.5 million. Likewise, our cumulative development and regulatory milestone payment and non-royalty sublicensing revenues payment obligations for a possible second aminoglycoside product under the agreement with Ionis will not exceed $9.75 million. To date, we have made development milestone payments of $7.0 million to Ionis with respect to plazomicin, $6.5 million of which was paid in cash and $0.5 million of which was paid in the form of our Series B convertible preferred stock. We are also required to pay additional milestone payments of up to $20.0 million in the aggregate upon the first achievement of specified threshold levels of annual net sales of certain aminoglycoside products in a calendar year. If any aminoglycoside product covered by the agreement is successfully commercialized, we will be required to pay royalties to Ionis in the low single digits on worldwide net sales of licensed products by us, our affiliates and sublicensees.
 Our license agreement with Ionis will continue for as long as we are obligated to pay royalties to them, which will be on a product-by-product basis until the later of (a) ten years from the date of first commercial sale of an aminoglycoside product covered by the agreement in the United States, Japan or Europe; and (b) the abandonment, revocation, invalidation or expiration of the last valid claim of a patent covered under the agreement which covers such product, not to exceed twenty years after the first commercial sale in the United States, Japan or Europe. Either party may terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach of the other party, and Ionis may terminate the agreement if we fail to make timely payments, subject to a specified cure period. We may also terminate the agreement or the license with respect to a particular product without cause upon 60 days’ notice.
 Thermo Fisher Collaborative Development and Commercialization Agreement
 In April 2016, we entered into a collaborative development and commercialization agreement (the “Assay Agreement”) with Microgenics Corporation (“Thermo Fisher”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Under the Assay Agreement, we and Thermo Fisher are co-developing and commercializing an in vitro assay to measure levels of plazomicin in serum and plasma to guide and monitor dosing regimens so that exposures fall within the desired range. Thermo Fisher submitted a 510(k) premarket submission in January 2018, which was accepted for substantive review on February 7, 2018. If plazomicin and the assay are approved, we and Thermo Fisher currently plan to have a commercial assay available near the time of the commercial launch of plazomicin in the United States.  The assay developed under the Assay Agreement is intended to provide TDM to certain patients receiving plazomicin. Thermo Fisher is responsible for the research, development, manufacture and sale of the assay. Depending on the commercialization strategy for the assay, we are required to pay Thermo Fisher up to an aggregate amount of approximately $6.8 million in milestone payments for the achievement of certain development, manufacturing and regulatory milestones. Intellectual property rights relating solely to the assay developed under the Assay Agreement are owned by Thermo Fisher and intellectual property rights relating solely to plazomicin are owned by us. In addition, each party retains ownership of certain background intellectual property and improvements thereto.
 Under the Assay Agreement, Thermo Fisher also has the worldwide exclusive rights to manufacture this assay during the period in which we continue to develop and commercialize plazomicin (unless the Assay Agreement is earlier terminated). Thermo Fisher also has the exclusive right to commercialize this assay under the Thermo Scientific name in each country in the territory in which we are commercializing plazomicin, for as long as we are commercializing plazomicin in such country. We are required to prioritize the promotion of the assay developed under the Assay Agreement relative to the promotion of any other assay capable of measuring plazomicin in certain countries, including the United States, Japan and Europe, so long as Thermo Fisher is capable of providing sufficient supply of the assay. The Assay Agreement further requires us to make certain annual payments to Thermo Fisher if commercialization targets are not met during certain periods following commercialization. If Thermo Fisher abandons its commercialization of the assay, Thermo Fisher is required to negotiate an agreement for the continued supply of the assay to us or our distributor.
 The term of the Assay Agreement continues until we cease development and commercialization of plazomicin. Either we or Thermo Fisher may terminate the Assay Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy (or similar event), and we may terminate without cause upon sixty days’ written notice to 
 20


Thermo Fisher. If we terminate the Assay Agreement without cause or Thermo Fisher terminates the Assay Agreement for cause prior to the payment of all milestone payments, we must pay to Thermo Fisher a sum equal to the amount that would have been due if the next applicable milestone had been achieved, provided that no payment will be due if we terminate the agreement at will in connection with the failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for plazomicin. If, within two years following the termination of the Assay Agreement by us at will or by Thermo Fisher for cause, we decide to develop and commercialize plazomicin, subject to certain conditions and limitations, we and Thermo Fisher are required to use good faith efforts to negotiate an agreement for the continued development, manufacture, supply and sale of the assay by Thermo Fisher on commercially reasonable terms, but we would have no duty to enter into any new agreement with Thermo Fisher and we would not be prohibited from negotiating or entering into an agreement with a third party for the development, manufacture, supply or sale of any assay.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical industry is very competitive and subject to rapid and significant innovation. Our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, universities, and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources, as well as larger research and development staff and more experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able to and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and drug products that are superior to, or more effectively marketed than, plazomicin or any other drug candidate that we are currently developing or that we may develop, which could render our products obsolete and noncompetitive.
 The competition in the antibiotics market is intense. Our goal is to establish plazomicin as a leader in the treatment of serious bacterial infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including CRE. Our clinical development program supports plazomicin’s differentiated profile from both approved and development-stage antibacterials by focusing on the treatment of serious bacterial infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae in patients with limited or no alternative treatment options, including patients with cUTI or AP. If approved, plazomicin will face competition from commercially available antibiotics such as tigecycline, which is marketed by Pfizer as Tygacil®, ceftazidime-avibactam, which is marketed in the United States by Allergan plc as Avycaz™, meropenem-vaborbactam which is marketed by Melinta Therapeutics as Vabomere™, and other aminoglycosides that are generically available (e.g., gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin), and polymyxins that are generically available (colistin and polymyxin B).
 In addition, if approved, plazomicin may face additional competition from antibiotics currently in clinical development. We are aware of other antibiotics currently in development. Allergan plc and Pfizer Inc. continue development of ceftazidime/avibactam (already marketed in the United States) and ceftaroline/avibactam for pneumonia and complicated urinary and intra-abdominal infections. Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing eravacycline for cUTI and intra-abdominal infections, though eravacycline failed to meet its primary endpoint in a recently completed Phase 3 trial in cUTI. Merck & Co., Inc. is developing relebactam + imipenem/cilastatin for complicated urinary and intra-abdominal infections and pneumonia.  Pfizer and Allergan are developing aztreonam-avibactam for certain life-threatening infections caused by MDR strains, including infections due to metallo-â-lactamase producing gram-negative pathogens. Zavante Therapeutics, Inc. is developing ZTI-01 for cUTI and Shionogi is developing cefiderocol for carbapenem-resistant gram-negative pathogens.
 If approved, we believe that plazomicin would compete effectively against both marketed and known pipeline competitors based on the following:
  
• | Potent in vitro and in vivo activity in nonclinical studies against MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including CRE;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Activity in the presence of a range of resistance mechanisms, including most aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, fluoroquinolone target site mutations, extended-spectrum β-lactamases, and carbapenemases;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Demonstration of similar efficacy to levofloxacin and acceptable safety in a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with cUTI infections caused primarily by non-resistant Enterobacteriaceae;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21


 
• | Demonstration of non-inferiority to meropenem at day 5 and statistically favorable outcomes compared to meropenem at day 17 in patients with cUTI/AP infections due to Enterobacteriaceae, including fluoroquinolone resistant and ESBL-producing isolates;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved efficacy, overall mortality and safety of plazomicin versus colistin in patients with serious bacterial infections due to CRE, based on results observed in the CARE study;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to individualize patient dosing using an in vitro drug-monitoring assay to optimize efficacy and safety of plazomicin therapy in BSI or pneumonia;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential for more convenient administration as a once-daily, 30-minute IV therapy compared to other IV antibiotics administered multiple times per day with infusion times up to two hours; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to reduce the healthcare costs associated with the treatment of such infections.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If we are unable to demonstrate these or other advantages of plazomicin over competing drugs and drug candidates, we may not be able to successfully commercialize plazomicin and our results of operations may suffer. Established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make plazomicin or any other product candidates that we develop obsolete. As a result of all of these factors, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection and/or regulatory approval or discovering, developing and commercializing antibiotics before we do.
 Intellectual Property
 The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates and our discovery programs, processes and know-how are important to our business. We have sought patent protection in the United States and certain other jurisdictions for plazomicin, C-Scape, and certain other inventions to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform that may be important to the development of our business.
 Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for our current and future product candidates and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Patents, issued or applied for, can cover inventions ranging from research compounds and techniques to processes related to specific products to the products themselves. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country.  We have applications or patents on platform technologies and methods of using our products (in either case, that may relate to classes of products or methods), that may confer additional patent protection but are not necessarily a protection against competition.
 Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our products depends in part on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover our activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates, discovery programs and processes. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 We consider that in the aggregate our patent applications, patents and licenses under patents owned by third parties are of material importance to our operations. For our lead product candidate, plazomicin, we have identified in the following paragraph the patents that are owned or controlled by us having claims directed to product-specific compositions of matter.  This paragraph does not identify all patents or applications that may relate to plazomicin but are not material. We also have pending patent applications or applications we continue to file that may give rise to new patents relating to plazomicin. In part due to the early stage of our other research and development, we do not 
 22


consider any of our additional patents or patent applications are material at this time and it is unclear what, if any, patent protection we will have for the ultimate products we choose to move forward through development.
 Plazomicin (Aminoglycoside)
 The patent portfolio for plazomicin is based upon an Achaogen-owned patent family that includes patents and patent applications directed to plazomicin and structural analogs thereof, pharmaceutical compositions containing plazomicin or analogs thereof, and methods of using plazomicin or analogs thereof in the treatment of bacterial infections. As of January 31, 2018, this patent family included four U.S. patents (U.S. Patent No. 8,383,596, issued February 26, 2013; U.S. Patent No. 8,822,424, issued September 2, 2014; U.S. Patent No 9,266,919, issued February 23, 2016; and, U.S. Patent No. 9,688,711, issued June 27, 2017 which we refer to herein as the ‘596, ‘424, ‘919 and ‘711 patents, respectively), and corresponding foreign patents and patent applications. As of January 31, 2018, we had corresponding granted patent or patents in Australia, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe (with country-specific validations), India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico and Taiwan. In addition, as of January 31, 2018, we had corresponding patent applications pending in Brazil, Europe, and the US. We expect any U.S. and foreign patents in this patent family to expire in November 2028, excluding any available extensions or adjustments.  Note, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) has determined that the ‘596 patent is entitled to 923 days of patent term adjustment.
 Assuming that plazomicin achieves regulatory approval and depending upon the date of any such approval, the term of a US patent could be extended up to the lesser of (i) up to five additional years or (ii) no more than fourteen years from plazomicin’s approval date, under the provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Plazomicin could also qualify for pediatric exclusivity, which can be obtained during the approval process or after approval, and effectively delays the approval of a generic application until six months after the expiration of any patent or other exclusivity that would otherwise delay approval, thus providing an additional six months without generic competition. In order to qualify for pediatric exclusivity, the FDA must make a written request for pediatric studies, the application holder must agree to the request and complete the studies within the required timeframe, and the studies must be accepted by the FDA based on a determination that the studies fairly respond to the request.
 Patent term extension and supplementary protection certificates also may be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval.  Additional intellectual property, including patent protection, may protect plazomicin in areas including but not limited to method of use, manufacturing, and platform technologies. 
 Additional Patent Positions
 Our C-Scape program was created at Achaogen and we are pursuing intellectual property relating to this program. C-Scape was granted QIDP designation by the FDA which provides incentives for the development of new antibiotics, including priority review and extension by an additional five years of any non-patent market exclusivity  the product may be awarded upon approval. Currently, C-Scape is not covered by any issued patents but we are pursuing patent positions in connection with various aspects of our program.
Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary data and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, and partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. Consequently, we anticipate that trade secrets and know-how will, over time, be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles, and the movement of personnel skilled in the art from academic to industry scientific positions.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any 
 23


manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 U.S. Government Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”), requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of preapproval audits of selected clinical sites, clinical trial vendors and sponsor facilities to ensure that the clinical trials upon which the approval will be based have been conducted in accordance with GCP and consistent with regulations for the protection of human subject rights described in 21 C.F.R. 50; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. 
 24


As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. In 2008, we submitted our first IND to the FDA for plazomicin.
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Marketing Approval
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under PDUFA guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician 
 25


communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
 The FDA generally accepts data from foreign clinical trials in support of an NDA if the trials were conducted under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the FDA nevertheless may accept the data in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection, if deemed necessary. Although the FDA generally requests that marketing applications be supported by some data from domestic clinical studies, the FDA may accept foreign data as the sole basis for marketing approval if (1) the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, (2) the studies were performed by clinical investigators with recognized competence, and (3) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection or, if the FDA considers the inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means.
 The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to 
 26


the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
 The FDA has various programs, including fast-track designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
 To be eligible for a fast-track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need, or if the drug qualifies as a QIDP under the GAIN Act. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast-track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, or that the drug qualifies as a QIDP under the GAIN Act. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six and 10-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast-track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
 Moreover, under the provisions of the FDASIA, passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a BTD. A BTD is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for the other expedited review and approval programs, including accelerated approval, priority review, and fast-track designation. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 We received fast-track designation from the FDA for plazomicin in August 2012. We received BTD from the FDA for plazomicin in May 2017.

Post-Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 In addition, Title II of the Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”), have imposed new “track and trace” requirements on the distribution of prescription drug products by manufacturers, distributors, and other entities in the drug supply chain.  These requirements are being phased in over a ten-year period.  The DSCSA ultimately will require product identifiers (i.e., serialization) on prescription drug products in order to establish an electronic interoperable prescription product system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States. The DSCSA replaced the prior drug “pedigree” requirements under the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”) and pre-empts existing state drug pedigree laws and regulations.  The DSCSA also establishes requirements for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third party logistic providers.  These licensing requirements preempt states from imposing licensing requirements that are 
 28


inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or otherwise encompassed by standards established by FDA pursuant to the DSCSA. Until FDA promulgates regulations to address the DSCSA’s new national licensing standard, current state licensing requirements typically remain in effect. 
 Finally, PDMA regulates the distribution of drug samples by drug manufacturers and, along with state laws, limits the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and imposes certain recordkeeping, reporting and accountability requirements on distribution of drug samples. 
 505(b)(2) Regulatory Pathway
 As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or new uses of products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need, or reduce the requirements, to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug(s). The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the branded reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.  We plan to pursue a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for C-Scape.
Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products
 Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book.  Any applicant who files a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a ‘‘section viii’’ statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant.  A 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.
 Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity
 Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the activity of the drug substance. We believe that our product candidate plazomicin is a new chemical entity. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references the previously approved drug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three-year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a 
 29


previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. For drug products that contain an “antibiotic” ingredient approved prior to November 21,1997, the statute imposes certain limitations on the award of five-year non-patent exclusivity. However, we do not believe these limitations would apply to any of our investigational antibiotics.
 Qualified Infectious Disease Product Exclusivity
 Under the GAIN Act provisions of FDASIA, which was signed into law in July 2012, the FDA may designate a product as a “qualified infectious disease product” (“QIDP”). In order to receive this designation, a drug must qualify as an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by either (1) an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens, or (2) a so-called “qualifying pathogen” found on a list of potentially dangerous, drug-resistant organisms to be established and maintained by the FDA under the new law. A sponsor must request such designation before submitting a marketing application. FDA granted QIDP designation for plazomicin for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, complicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and catheter-related BSI on December 14, 2014. FDA also granted QIDP designation to C-Scape in January 2017.
 The benefits of QIDP designation include eligibility for priority review and fast-track designation, and an extension by an additional five years of any non-patent marketing exclusivity period awarded, such as a five-year exclusivity period awarded for a new molecular entity. This extension is in addition to any pediatric exclusivity extension that may be awarded, and the extension will be awarded only to a drug first approved on or after the date of enactment.
 The GAIN Act provisions prohibit the grant of an exclusivity extension where the application is a supplement to an application for which an extension is in effect or has expired, is a subsequent application for a specified change to an approved product, or is an application for a product that does not meet the definition of QIDP based on the uses for which it is ultimately approved.
 Foreign Regulation
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For example, in the EU, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application, in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the EU, we may submit marketing authorization applications, either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures.
 Centralized Procedure
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the EMA that is valid in all EU member states, as well as Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines (such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines), and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified 
 30


diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use (the “CHMP”). Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding stop-clocks.
 National Authorization Procedures
 There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:

• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the EU, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 Regulation of In Vitro Diagnostic Assays
 In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Diagnostic tests are classified as medical devices under the FDCA. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”). The FDA classifies all medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are categorized as either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) pre-market notification requesting clearance of the device for commercial distribution in the United States, unless an exemption applies. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k)-cleared device are categorized as Class III, requiring a PMA.
 To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, a pre-market notification must be submitted to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k)-cleared device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA, or the device must be one that has been reclassified from Class III to either Class II or I. The 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the FDA, but may take significantly longer and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) pre-market 
 31


notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre-market notification, the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require pre-market approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA may review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or a PMA is obtained.
 PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
 We and our partner Microgenics Corporation (a part of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) (“Thermo Fisher”) are developing an in vitro assay for plazomicin and have worked together to generate the data required for submission of a 510(k) premarket notification. Thermo Fisher submitted the 510(k) in January 2018, and it was accepted for substantive review on February 7, 2018. We anticipate coordination between the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and Center for Devices and Radiological Health on the review of the plazomicin in vitro assay submission. Though Thermo Fisher and Achaogen have mutually agreed to submit via the 510(k) regulatory pathway, the FDA may conclude that an alternate approval pathway or new 510(k) submission is required. The assay may also be classified as a PMA if the FDA determines that the device is high risk. The assay may also be classified by the FDA as a companion diagnostic for plazomicin in association with plazomicin’s possible indication for BSI. On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and clearance or approval process for “In vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance, the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic. In the event our in vitro assay for plazomicin becomes classified as a companion diagnostic, we believe our development program is consistent with the guidance.
 In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), in vitro medical devices are required to conform with the essential requirements of the EU Directive on In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices (Directive No 98/79/EC, as amended). To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, the manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure. The conformity assessment varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. For low-risk devices, the conformity assessment can be carried out internally, but for higher risk devices it requires the intervention of an accredited EEA Notified Body. If successful, the conformity assessment concludes with the drawing up by the manufacturer of an EC Declaration of Conformity entitling the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its products and to sell them throughout the EEA. The data generated for the U.S. registration will be sufficient to satisfy the regulatory requirements for the EU and other countries.
 On April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive, as well the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/746), which repeals and replaces the EU Directive on In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member States, regulations are directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member State laws implementing them, in all EEA member States and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The Medical Devices Regulation and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, are intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. 
 32


The Medical Devices Regulation will however only become applicable three years after publication (in May 2020), while the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation will only become applicable five years after publication (in  May 2022).  Once applicable, the new regulations will among other things:
  
• | strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers' responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Healthcare Laws
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws govern certain business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and physician payment and drug pricing laws.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses. In addition, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA,”) signed into law on March 2010, broadened the reach of both the Anti-Kickback Statute and the criminal healthcare fraud statute by amending the intent requirement such that a person or 
 33


entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. ACA created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. Applicable manufacturers are also required to report annually to the government certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, certain states require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or require the tracking and reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 At launch we expect plazomicin to be utilized within the hospital environment and therefore, our customers to be reimbursed under a prospective payment system, or a predetermined payment amount that is based on the diagnosis related groups (“DRGs”) for Medicare patients and under a bundled payment for commercially insured patients. These payment amounts differ by type of diagnoses, procedures and the severity of the patient’s condition, among other things. Typically, the cost of treatment for hospital acquired infections, for which plazomicin would be used, is included in the DRG or bundled payment and not eligible for any separate payment. For catastrophic cases where costs greatly exceed the bundled payment amount, the hospital may be eligible for an outlier that is intended to cover part of the expense above the standard payment. 
 We have submitted a New Technology Add-On Payment (“NTAP”) application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). In creating the NTAP program, Congress established a process of identifying and ensuring adequate payment for new medical services and technologies (collectively referred to as new technologies). The NTAP program is meant to partially compensate hospitals for using new products that are not reflected already in Medicare’s bundled payment calculations. For NTAP technologies, Medicare will make an add-on payment equal to the lesser of (i) 50 percent of the estimated costs of the new technology (if the estimated costs for the case including the new technology exceed Medicare’s payment), or (ii) 50 percent of the difference between the full DRG payment and the hospital’s estimated cost for the case. For NTAP payment eligibility, we were required to submit an application to CMS on or before October 20, 2017, satisfy NTAP criteria for newness, substantial clinical improvement relative to existing therapies and specific cost thresholds, and have FDA approval by July 1, 2018. We have received confirmation that CMS is currently evaluating our application. We expect a decision will be published 
 34


in the upcoming CMS Inpatient Prospective Payment (“IPPS”) Rule to be published in or about August 2018. If successful, the add-on payment will be effective and available to hospitals for up to three years.
Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures.
 Healthcare Reform
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, and applying new payment methodologies. 
 Since taking office, the current administration has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the ACA and we expect that the administration and U.S. Congress will continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA.  There is also a considerable amount of uncertainty as to the prospective implementation of the ACA and what similar measures or other changes might be enacted at the federal and/or state level. While there may be significant changes to the healthcare environment in the future, the specific changes, their timing and their potential impact on us are not yet apparent. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the ACA including coverage and reimbursement, the exchanges, and many core aspects of the current healthcare marketplace. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA to reduce healthcare expenditures, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year that will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional action is taken by Congress, and reductions in Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, and this will remain a prominent political issue. We anticipate continued focus, Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies and reduce Medicaid and other healthcare funding.
 Manufacturing
 We currently contract with third parties for the manufacturing and testing of our product candidates and intend to do so in the future.  We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build or own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities.  The use of contracted manufacturing and reliance on collaboration partners is relatively capital-efficient and has eliminated the need for our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional staff. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing and quality experience to oversee our contract manufacturers. 
 All of our third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic audits to confirm compliance with applicable regulations and must pass inspection before we can manufacture our drugs for commercial use.  Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties.  These actions could have a material impact on the availability of our products.

We currently rely on a limited number of third parties for our required raw materials, drug substance, and finished drug product for our preclinical research, clinical trials and potential commercial production.  For plazomicin, we source raw materials from various commercial suppliers, primarily located in Europe and the People’s Republic of China, including the aminoglycoside precursor sisomicin. Our drug substance has been manufactured by Hovione and we have entered into a long-term agreement with Hovione for commercial production of plazomicin. The drug product is manufactured by Pfizer CentreOne (formerly Hospira) and we have entered into a long-term agreement with Pfizer CentreOne for commercial production of plazomicin.
 Plazomicin
 Process. Plazomicin is an organic compound of low molecular weight, commonly referred to as a small molecule. Plazomicin is also considered a semi-synthetic molecule since it is derived from a primary starting material that is a natural product, sisomicin, produced by microbial fermentation. Plazomicin sulfate is prepared in four process stages (seven chemical steps) from sisomicin, with a final purification by ion-exchange chromatography and isolation by spray-drying of the amorphous sulfate salt from aqueous solution.  We believe that our use of a synthetic process will enable us to have a cost of manufacturing for plazomicin that is similar to other modern small molecule antibiotics.
 Bulk Drug Substance. In March 2017, we entered into a commercial validation and manufacturing agreement (the “Commercial Manufacturing Agreement”) with Hovione Limited (“Hovione”), an Ireland-based company with facilities in Portugal and Ireland.  Under the Commercial Manufacturing Agreement, Hovione agreed to carry out our validation program to validate and scale up our technology to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient of plazomicin (the “Product”). Upon successful completion of the validation program, the Commercial Manufacturing Agreement also includes the manufacturing of commercial quantities of the Product on a commercial scale at Hovione’s facilities. The Commercial Manufacturing Agreement has an initial term of seven years after the first delivery of the Product. 
 Pursuant to the Commercial Manufacturing Agreement, if plazomicin is approved by the FDA, we have minimum quantity and minimum annual purchase commitments from Hovione depending on our requirements and the period of time following approval by the FDA. For the first three years following approval of plazomicin by the FDA, we are required to purchase at least 80% of its required quantity of Product from Hovione. Following the initial three years after FDA approval, we are required to purchase between 40% and 66% of its required quantity from Hovione, depending on the amounts required during any such fiscal year. Contingent upon FDA’s approval of plazomicin, we have minimum annual purchase commitments from Hovione, beginning in 2020 through 2024. Beyond the minimum purchase obligation contained in the Manufacturing Agreement, we may use other suppliers and Hovione is obligated to cooperate with us in such efforts, including by performing certain technology transfers. The Commercial Manufacturing Agreement may be early terminated by either party for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency of which termination fees related to the minimum annual commitments may apply. In the event the FDA does not approve plazomicin or the approval is withdrawn, we are required to pay 50% of the remaining minimum annual commitment for that calendar year and the following two years’ minimum annual commitments.  
 Drug Product. We have employed the services of Pfizer CentreOne to produce our plazomicin IV drug product. In August 2015, we entered into a development and supply agreement with Hospira, which was amended in September 2015 to include the Pfizer CentreOne Group of Pfizer, whereby Pfizer CentreOne assists us in the development and commercialization of plazomicin for IV administration. If we receive regulatory approval for plazomicin, we will purchase from Pfizer CentreOne our requirement of such product for commercial sale in the U.S., Canada and the EU (the “Territory”).  
 In our NDA, the Pfizer CentreOne facility in McPherson, Kansas (“McPherson”) was filed as the manufacturer of the sterile IV drug product vials for plazomicin. In February 2017, Pfizer CentreOne received an FDA warning letter on Form 483 related to McPherson. In January 2018, this warning letter was upgraded to a designation of “Voluntary Action Indicated”, clearing a regulatory path for approval of plazomicin out of McPherson. Pfizer CentreOne continues to work to improve the GMP compliance status for McPherson and it remains our planned facility for plazomicin launch.  In parallel, we are actively transferring production of plazomicin to an alternative Pfizer CentreOne site in Kalamazoo, Michigan as a second source and back-up launch 
 36


facility. Our current plans anticipate FDA approval of plazomicin in June 2018 and subsequent commercial launch in the United States in 2018, if our NDA is approved by the PDUFA date.
 C-Scape
 C-Scape is a combination of ceftibuten, an approved third generation cephalosporin, and clavulanate, an approved β-lactamase inhibitor. We purchase clavulanate and ceftibuten from two separate third-party suppliers (or contract manufacturers) who have experience working with these compounds. The clinical drug product (“DP”) for C-Scape is being supplied by a third-party contract manufacturing organization who has experience with these types of compounds.
 Research and Development Expenses
