Item 1. Business
The Company
 
PositiveID Corporation, including its wholly-owned subsidiaries PositiveID Diagnostics Inc. (f/k/a Microfluidic Systems) (“PDI”), E-N-G Mobile Systems, Inc. (“ENG”), and Thermomedics, Inc. (“Thermomedics”), (collectively, the “Company” or “PositiveID”), develops molecular diagnostic systems for bio-threat detection and rapid medical testing; manufactures specialty technology vehicles; and markets the Caregiver® non-contact clinical thermometer. The Company’s fully automated pathogen detection systems and assays are designed to detect a range of biological threats. The Company’s M-BAND (Microfluidic Bio-agent Autonomous Networked Detector) system is an airborne bio-threat detection system developed for the homeland defense industry to detect biological weapons of mass destruction. The Company is developing Firefly Dx, an automated pathogen detection system for rapid diagnostics, both for clinical and point-of-need applications. The Company manufactures specialty technology vehicles focused primarily on mobile laboratory and communications applications. The Company’s Caregiver® thermometer is an FDA-cleared, infrared thermometer for the professional healthcare market.
 
PositiveID, formerly known as VeriChip Corporation, was formed as a Delaware corporation by Digital Angel Corporation in November 2001. In January 2002, we began our efforts to create a market for radio frequency identification, or RFID, systems that utilized a human implantable microchip. During the first half of 2005 we acquired two businesses focused on providing RFID systems for healthcare applications. Those businesses (EXi Wireless and Instantel) were merged in 2007 to form Xmark Corporation (“Xmark”), which was a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours.
 
On July 18, 2008, we completed the sale of all of the outstanding capital stock of Xmark, which at the time was principally all of our operations, to Stanley Canada Corporation (“Stanley”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stanley Black and Decker. The sale transaction was closed for $47.9 million in cash, which consisted of the $45 million purchase price plus a balance sheet adjustment of approximately $2.9 million, which was adjusted to $2.8 million at settlement of the escrow. Under the terms of the stock purchase agreement, $43.4 million of the proceeds were paid at closing and $4.4 million was released from escrow in July 2009. As a result, we recorded a gain on the sale of Xmark of $6.2 million, with $4.5 million of that gain deferred until 2009 when the escrow was settled.
 
Following the completion of the sale of Xmark to Stanley, we retired all of our outstanding debt for a combined payment of $13.5 million, and settled all contractual payments to Xmark’s and our officers and management for $9.1 million. On August 28, 2008, we paid a special dividend to our stockholders of $15.8 million.
 
On May 23, 2011, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire PDI, pursuant to which PDI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Since 2012, PDI has been doing business as PositiveID. The Company specializes in the production of automated instruments for a wide range of applications in the detection and processing of biological samples, ranging from rapid medical testing to airborne pathogen detection for homeland security.
 
On October 21, 2015, we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Thermomedics, a Nevada corporation, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement by and between PositiveID and Sanomedics Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Sanomedics”), the shareholder of Thermomedics (collectively the “Thermomedics Acquisition”). On December 4, 2015, we entered into a first amendment to the stock purchase agreement with Sanomedics. PositiveID, Sanomedics and Thermomedics also entered into a management services and control Agreement (the “Control Agreement”), dated December 4, 2015, whereby PositiveID was appointed the manager of Thermomedics. On March 4, 2016, PositiveID, Sanomedics and Thermomedics entered into a letter agreement (the “March Agreement”), which included an amendment to the Control Agreement, an agreement to terminate intercompany indebtedness, and an agreement for the transfer of Thermomedics’ intellectual property. Under the terms of the March Agreement, PositiveID, Sanomedics and Thermomedics agreed to extend the closing date for the stock purchase agreement to March 31, 2016. As a result of the Company assuming control of Thermomedics on December 4, 2015, the Company determined, pursuant to ASC 805-10-25-6, that December 4, 2015 was the acquisition date of Thermomedics for accounting purposes and began consolidating the balance sheet and results of operations of Thermomedics as of that date. The Company completed the acquisition of the capital stock of Thermomedics on August 25, 2016.
 
On December 22, 2015, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire ENG, pursuant to which ENG became a wholly-owned subsidiary. ENG manufactures specialty technology vehicles focused primarily on mobile labs, command and communications centers, and cellular applications. The acquisition of ENG closed on December 24, 2015.

Our Business
 
We are a life sciences and technology company focused primarily on the healthcare and homeland security markets. Within our detection and diagnostics business, we specialize in the development of microfluidic systems for the automated preparation of and performance of biological assays in order to detect biological threats at high-value locations and analyze biological samples at the point of need. Thermomedics markets the Caregiver non-contact thermometer to the professional healthcare market. Our ENG subsidiary manufactures specialty technology vehicles. PositiveID has a substantial portfolio of intellectual property related primarily to sample preparation and rapid medical testing applications, and the Caregiver non-contact thermometer.
 
Since its inception, including PDI prior to its acquisition, we have received over $50 million in U.S. government grants and contracts, primarily from the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). We have submitted, or are in the process of submitting, bids on various potential U.S. government contracts.
 
M-BAND
 
Our M-BAND technology, developed under contract with the U.S. DHS Science & Technology directorate, is a bio-aerosol monitor with fully integrated systems for sample collection, processing and detection modules. M-BAND continuously and autonomously analyzes air samples for the detection of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and toxins for up to 30 days. Results from individual M-BAND instruments are reported via a secure wireless network in real time to give an accurate and up-to-date status of field conditions. M-BAND performs high specificity detection for up to six organisms on the Centers for Disease Control’s category A and B select agents list. Further, we believe M-BAND was developed in accordance with DHS guidelines.
 
In December 2012, the Company entered into a Sole and Exclusive License Agreement (the “Boeing License Agreement”), a Teaming, (the “Teaming Agreement”) and a security agreement (the “Boeing Security Agreement”), with The Boeing Company (“Boeing”). The Boeing License Agreement provides Boeing the exclusive license to sell PositiveID’s M-BAND airborne bio-threat detector for the DHS BioWatch next generation opportunity, as well as other opportunities (government or commercial) that may arise in the North American market. As consideration for entry into the Boeing License Agreement, Boeing paid a license fee of $2.5 million (the “Boeing License Fee”) to the Company in three installments, which were paid in full during 2012 and 2013 and was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015. Under the Teaming Agreement, which has now expired, and subject to certain conditions, the Company retained the exclusive rights to serve as the reagent and assay supplier of M-BAND systems to Boeing. The Company also retained all rights to sell M-BAND units, reagents and assays in international markets. Pursuant to the Boeing Security Agreement, the Company granted Boeing a security interest in all of its assets, including the licensed products and intellectual property rights (as defined in the Boeing License Agreement), to secure the Company’s performance under the Boeing License Agreement.
 
Firefly Dx
 
Our Firefly Dx system is designed to deliver molecular diagnostic results from a sample in less than 30 minutes, which, we believe, would enable accurate diagnostics leading to more rapid and effective treatment than what is currently available with existing systems. The Firefly Dx breadboard prototype system has already demonstrated the ability to detect and identify common pathogens and diseases such as E. coli, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus, Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus Aureus, Clostridium difficile, influenza and others. Firefly Dx is designed to be a simple-to-use, point-of-care, real-time polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) device, which is designed for use by medical personnel at the point-of-need; first response teams to detect biological agents associated with weapons of mass destruction; agricultural screening in domestic sectors and developing countries; and point-of-need monitoring of pathogenic outbreaks.

We have demonstrated in our labs that the entire Firefly Dx prototype design functions as intended through the complete sample purification and detection process without the use of any third-party hardware. The next step in the development of Firefly Dx is to combine these processes and breadboards into single units and demonstrate the capability to run a test from putting the raw sample in the cartridge through sample preparation, PCR and real-time detection as a single system. We are currently seeking a government contract or other partner to help us fund the remaining development and the build of the smaller, field-able prototype for testing by third parties to prepare for commercialization.
 
Caregiver
 
Caregiver is an infrared thermometer, FDA-cleared for clinical use, that measures forehead temperature in adults, children and infants, without contact. It delivers an oral-equivalent temperature directly from the forehead in one to two seconds. Caregiver is the world’s first clinically validated, non-contact thermometer for the healthcare providers market, which includes hospitals, physicians’ offices, medical clinics, nursing homes and other long-term care institutions, and acute care hospitals. Caregiver requires minimal training and is proven as accurate as other methods of clinical thermometry, which include predictive oral/rectal/axillary electronic, infrared tympanic, temporal artery contact scanner, etc. Other temperature monitoring devices may require intensive technique concentration, which make them prone to mistaken placement or dwell time, and may require replacement metal probes, cords, or other parts. The Caregiver thermometer with TouchFree™ technology is less likely to transmit infectious disease than devices that require even minimal contact. Caregiver saves medical facilities the cost of probe covers ($0.05 to $0.10 per temperature reading), storage space and disposal costs. It is estimated that Caregiver can offer savings of $250 or more per year per device in probe cover supplies alone.
ENG Mobile Systems
 
Our ENG subsidiary is a leader in the specialty technology vehicle market, with a focus on mobile laboratories, command and communications applications, and mobile cellular systems. The fastest growing segment of ENG’s business over the last decade are its mobile labs, which include government and corporate laboratories for environmental, chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological and explosives testing in the field. ENG’s MobiLab™ Systems have become the primary choice of mobile labs for scientific and environmental agencies and organizations throughout the country because of their productivity in the field. ENG has delivered more than 400 MobiLabs to customers around the world. The combination of PositiveID’s expert bio-detection technologies with ENG’s advanced mobile labs is expected to offer customers a next generation, best of breed solution in the mobile laboratory space.
 
ENG also provides specialty vehicle manufacturing for TV news vans and trucks, emergency response trailers, mobile command centers, infrared inspection, and other special purpose vehicles. ENG provides technical support to customers’ field personnel through its training and educational programs, and also offers customizable service and maintenance agreements. ENG’s mobile cellular systems offer temporary cell sites to boost capacity, as well as the latest technology for testing site performance. During the past 25 years, ENG has pioneered numerous engineering and design breakthroughs.
 
Legacy Products
 
Between 2011 and 2013, we entered into license or sale agreements to dispose of certain technologies concentrated in the area of diabetes management and patient identification. Those products and their status are as follows:
 
VeriChip and GlucoChip
 
Throughout the course of 2012 through 2014, the Company and VeriTeQ, a business run by a former related party (CEO of the Company through 2011), entered into a number of agreements for the intellectual property related to the Company’s embedded biosensor portfolio, which ultimately resulted in a GlucoChip and Settlement Agreement, entered into on October 20, 2014 (the “GlucoChip Agreement”), under which the final element of the Company’s implantable microchip business was transferred to VeriTeQ.
 
Pursuant to the VeriTeQ agreements, the Company holds a Note that was received as payment for shared services payments that the Company made on behalf of VeriTeQ during 2011 and 2012 which Note had an original value of $222,115. The note has been fully reserved in all periods presented. The Company also holds a five-year warrant dated November 13, 2013, with original terms entitling the Company to purchase 300,000 shares of VeriTeQ common stock at a price of $2.84. Pursuant to the terms of the warrant, in particular the full quantity and pricing reset provisions, the warrant had an original dollar value of $852,000 and can be exercised using a cashless exercise feature.
 
On October 20, 2014, the Company entered into the GlucoChip Agreement with VeriTeQ to transfer the intellectual property related to its GlucoChip development and to provide financial support to VeriTeQ, for a period of up to two years, in the form of convertible promissory notes. VeriTeQ issued the Company Convertible Promissory Notes in total principal amount of $200,000, and agreed to provide VeriTeQ with continuing financial support through the issuance of additional convertible promissory notes up to an additional amount of $205,000. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had issued Notes with a principal value of $200,000 under the GlucoChip Agreement. As VeriTeQ is in default of its agreements with the Company, there is no intention to provide any additional notes until such time as all defaults are cured.
 
On October 19, 2015, VeriTeQ received a default notice from its senior lender and a Notice of Disposition of Collateral advising the Company that the senior lender, acting as collateral agent, intended to sell the assets at auction, which it did on November 4, 2015. On November 25, 2015, VeriTeQ entered into a stock purchase agreement with an unaffiliated company whereby VeriTeQ agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of that company, and on May 6, 2016, VeriTeQ completed the closing of that agreement.
 
Pursuant to the cashless exercise feature of the VeriTeQ warrant and subsequent sale of the underlying shares, the Company realized $335,600 of income which was recorded under other income in the consolidated Statement of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2015. As VeriTeQ is an early stage company, not yet fully capitalized, the Company plans to continue to fully reserve all note receivable and warrant balances. If and when proceeds are realized in the future, gains will be recognized. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding convertible notes receivable from VeriTeQ of $422,115 and is also owed default principal and interest of which a full reserve has been established as noted above.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
Our sales, marketing and distribution plan for our healthcare products is to align with large medical distribution companies, and either manufacture the products to their specification or license the products and underlying technology to them. We have entered into various distribution agreements with several medical equipment suppliers to distribute our Caregiver thermometer. We will also sell the Caregiver thermometer under separate agreements with commissioned independent sales representatives and smaller distributors who have non-exclusive territorial agreements. ENG markets directly to customers through its internal sales force, website, referrals and channel partners.
 
We are subject to certain indemnification obligations in connection with our distribution agreements. We are usually required to procure and maintain product liability insurance of specified limits per occurrence and in the aggregate, naming the contracting party as an additional insured. Our distributors, resellers, and sales representatives typically agree not to sell competitive products during the term of their agreements with us.
 
Manufacturing: Distributor and Supplier Arrangements
 
We have historically outsourced the manufacturing of all the hardware components of our systems to third parties. As of December 31, 2016, we have not had material difficulties obtaining system components. We believe that if any of our manufacturers or suppliers were to cease supplying us with system components, we would be able to procure alternative sources without material disruption to our business. We plan to continue to outsource any manufacturing requirements of our current and under-development products.
 
The technology and functionality of the Caregiver thermometer was co-designed by our new supplier in Taiwan, which, as discussed below, is the manufacturer and the assignor to us of the requisite U.S. governmental pre-marketing approvals. We designed the housing of our products, incorporating our extensive thermometry engineering and clinical expertise. We are in the process of designing and developing, with our supplier, all aspects, including technology, of our proposed second-generation products.
 
Under certain agreements, the Company may be subject to penalties if they are unable to supply products under its obligations. Since inception, the Company has never incurred any such penalties.
 
Environmental Regulation
 
We must comply with local, state, federal, and international environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business, including laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We expect our operations and products will be affected by future environmental laws and regulations, but we cannot predict the effects of any such future laws and regulations at this time. Our distributors who place our products on the market in the European Union are required to comply with EU Directive 2002/96/EC on waste electrical and electronic equipment, known as the WEEE Directive. Noncompliance by our distributors with EU Directive 2002/96/EC would adversely affect the success of our business in that market. Additionally, the applicability of EU Directive 2002/95/EC on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, known as the RoHS Directive which took effect on July 1, 2006 does not impact our business.

Government Regulation
 
Regulation by the FDA
 
The thermometers that we market are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices, such as our manufacturer, to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices. In addition, the Quality Management System employed by our contract manufacturer must meet the FDA 21 CFR Part 820, and its manufacturing facility is subject to periodic FDA audit. Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation be conducted before a device receives approval for commercial distribution. Our products are subject to the lowest level of regulation and only require pre-marketing approval, as described below.
 
In the United States, permission to distribute a new device generally can be met in one of three ways. The process relevant to our products requires that a pre-market notification (“510(k) Submission”) be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device that is not subject to pre-market approval (“PMA”), i.e., the “predicate” device. An appropriate predicate device for a pre-market notification is one that (i) was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, (ii) was approved under a PMA but then subsequently reclassified from class III to class II or I, or (iii) has been found to be substantially equivalent and cleared for commercial distribution under a 510(k) Submission. Applicants must submit descriptive data and, when necessary, performance data to establish that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device. (In some instances not relevant to our products, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) Submission. The FDA must issue an order finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to existing devices covered by a 510(k) Submission that do not raise new questions of safety or effectiveness can generally be made without additional 510(k) Submissions. More significant changes, such as new designs or materials, may require a separate 510(k) with data to support that the modified device remains substantially equivalent. The FDA has recently begun to review its clearance process in an effort to make it more rigorous, which may require additional clinical data, time and effort for product clearance.
 
We have received a 510(k) pre-market approval from the FDA for our thermometers. This 510(k) will allow us to sell our second- generation thermometers without additional approvals. However, we may need to obtain recertification. Depending on product changes, this recertification may require a complete documentation package, an abbreviated documentation package or an internal documentation package, a determination to be made by guidance documents from the FDA, in concert with our regulatory consultants.
 
Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the United States to take advantage of differing regulatory requirements. If we market in foreign countries, such as the European countries, ISO 13485 is the internationally recognized standard for medical devices. Products must comply with ISO 13485 to receive the “CE” mark. We design our products to comply with the requirements of both the FDA and ISO 13485. We intend to conduct audits of our contract manufacturers to ensure compliance with these regulations. If an audit uncovers problems, there is a risk of disruption in product availability.
 
Upon the completion of development, we intend to apply for a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) waiver from the FDA to market Firefly Dx.
 
CLIA Waiver. Congress passed the CLIA in 1988 establishing quality standards for all laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test was performed. The requirements are based on the complexity of the test and not the type of laboratory where the testing is performed. As defined by CLIA, waived tests are categorized as “simple laboratory examinations and procedures that have an insignificant risk of an erroneous result.” The FDA determines the criteria for tests being simple with a low risk of error and approves manufacturer’s applications for test system waiver.
 
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements. Generally speaking, unless an exemption applies such as applying for a CLIA waiver, each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the United States will require either prior clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (“FFDCA”), or a PMA, approved by the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes — Class I, Class II or Class III — depending on the degree of risk to the patient associated with the medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose low or moderate risks are placed in either Class I or II, respectively. The manufacturer of a Class II device is required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device and demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA. This process is known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are considered high risk and placed in Class III, requiring premarket approval.

Pervasive and Continuing Regulation. After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

● | quality system regulations, (“QSR”), which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of regulated products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses; 
● | clearance or approval of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use; 
● | medical device reporting, (“MDR”), regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if the manufacturer’s device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 
● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; and 
● | medical device tracking requirements apply when the failure of the device would be reasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences. 

Fraud and Abuse
 
We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Affairs health programs. We have never been challenged by a government authority under any of these laws and believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws. However, because of the far-reaching nature of these laws, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws. In addition, there can be no assurance that the occurrence of one or more violations of these laws would not result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Anti-Kickback Laws
 
We may directly or indirectly be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws. In particular, the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs.
 
Federal False Claims Act
 
We may become subject to the Federal False Claims Act (“FCA”). The FCA imposes civil fines and penalties against anyone who knowingly submits or causes to be submitted to a government agency a false claim for payment. The FCA contains so-called “whistle-blower” provisions that permit a private individual to bring a claim, called a qui tam action, on behalf of the government to recover payments made as a result of a false claim. The statute provides that the whistle-blower may be paid a portion of any funds recovered as a result of the lawsuit.
State Laws and Regulations
 
Many states have enacted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and FCA. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 contains provisions that give monetary incentives to states to enact new state false claims acts. The state Attorneys General are actively engaged in promoting the passage and enforcement of these laws. While the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and FCA apply only to federal programs, many similar state laws apply both to state funded and to commercial health care programs. In addition to these laws, all states have passed various consumer protection statutes. These statutes generally prohibit deceptive and unfair marketing practices, including making untrue or exaggerated claims regarding consumer products. There are potentially a wide variety of other state laws, including state privacy laws, to which we might be subject. We have not conducted an exhaustive examination of these state laws.

Laws and Regulations Governing Privacy and Security
 
There are various federal and state laws and rules regulating the protection of consumer and patient privacy. We have never been challenged by a governmental authority under any of these laws and believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws. However, because of the far-reaching nature of these laws, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our systems and data security procedures to be in compliance with these laws. Our failure to protect health information received from customers could subject us to civil or criminal liability and adverse publicity and could harm or business and impair our ability to attract new customers.
U.S. Federal Trade Commission Oversight
 
An increasing focus of the United States Federal Trade Commission’s (the “FTC”), consumer protection regulation is the impact of technological change on protection of consumer privacy. Under the FTC’s statutory authority to prosecute unfair or deceptive acts and practices, the FTC vigorously enforces promises a business makes about how personal information is collected, used and secured.
 
Since 1999, the FTC has taken enforcement action against companies that do not abide by their representations to consumers of electronic security and privacy. More recently, the FTC has found that failure to take reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect sensitive personal information is an unfair practice violating federal law. In the consent decree context, offenders are routinely required to adopt very specific cyber security and internal compliance mechanisms, as well as submit to twenty years of independent compliance audits. Businesses that do not adopt reasonable and appropriate data security controls or that misrepresent privacy assurances to users have been subject to civil penalties as high as $22.5 million.
 
In 2009, the FTC issued rules requiring vendors of personal health records to notify customers of any breach of unsecured, individually identifiable health information. Also, a third-party service provider of such vendors or entities that experiences a breach must notify such vendors or entities of the breach. If we experience a breach of our systems containing personal health records, we will be required to provide these notices and may be subject to penalties. Violations of these requirements may be prosecuted by the FTC as an unfair or deceptive act or practice and could result in significant harm to our reputation.
 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (“HIPAA”), govern how various entities and individuals can use and disclose protected health information. If we begin transmitting individually identifiable health information in connection with certain standard transactions regulated by HIPAA, we would likely have to implement a HIPAA compliance program to ensure our uses and disclosures of health information are done in accordance with the regulations. Under the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, (the “HITECH Act”), we may be subject to certain federal privacy and security requirements relating to individually identifiable health information we maintain. We may be required to enter into written business associate agreements with certain health care providers and health plans relating to the privacy and security of protected health information, to the extent our customers are covered entities under HIPAA and to the extent we receive, use or disclose protected health information on their behalf. Under the HITECH Act, we would be required by federal law to comply with those business associate agreements, as well as certain privacy and security requirements found in HIPAA and the HITECH Act as they relate to our activities as a business associate. If we are a covered entity or business associate under HIPAA and the HITECH Act, compliance with those requirements would require us to, among other things, conduct a risk analysis, implement a risk management plan, implement policies and procedures, and conduct employee training. The HITECH Act would also require us to notify patients or our customers, to the extent that they are covered entities subject to HIPAA, of a breach of privacy or security of individually identifiable health information. Breaches may also require notification to the Department of Health and Human Services and the media. Experiencing a breach could have a material impact on our reputation. The standards under HIPAA and the HITECH Act could be interpreted by regulatory authorities in ways that could require us to make material changes to our operations. Failure to comply with these federal privacy and security laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties. Civil penalties can go as high as $50,000 per violation, with an annual maximum of $1.5 million for all violations of an identical provision in a calendar year.
State Legislation
 
Many states have privacy laws relating specifically to the use and disclosure of healthcare information. Federal healthcare privacy laws may preempt state laws that are less restrictive or offer fewer protections for healthcare information than the federal law if it is impossible to comply with both sets of laws. More restrictive or protective state laws still may apply to us, and state laws will still apply to the extent that they are not contrary to federal law. Therefore, we may be required to comply with one or more of these multiple state privacy laws. Statutory penalties for violation of these state privacy laws varies widely. Violations also may subject us to lawsuits for invasion of privacy claims, or enforcement actions brought by state Attorneys General. We have not conducted an exhaustive examination of these state laws.

Many states currently have laws in place requiring organizations to notify individuals if there has been unauthorized access to certain unencrypted personal information. Several states also require organizations to notify the applicable state Attorney General or other governmental entity in the event of a data breach, and may also require notification to consumer reporting agencies if the number of individuals involved surpasses a defined threshold. We may be required to comply with one or more of these notice of security breach laws in the event of unauthorized access to personal information. In addition to statutory penalties for a violation of the notice of security breach laws, we may be exposed to liability from affected individuals.
 
Regulation of Government Bid Process and Contracting
 
Contracts with federal governmental agencies are obtained by primarily through a competitive proposal/bidding process. Although practices vary, typically a formal Request for Proposal is issued by the governmental agency, stating the scope of work to be performed, length of contract, performance bonding requirements, minimum qualifications of bidders, selection criteria and the format to be followed in the bid or proposal. Usually, a committee appointed by the governmental agency reviews proposals and makes an award determination. The committee may award the contract to a particular bidder or decide not to award the contract. The committees consider a number of factors, including the technical quality of the proposal, the offered price and the reputation of the bidder for providing quality care. The award of a contract may be subject to formal or informal protest by unsuccessful bidders through a governmental appeals process. Our contracts with governmental agencies often require us to comply with numerous additional requirements regarding recordkeeping and accounting, non-discrimination in the hiring of personnel, safety, safeguarding confidential information, management qualifications, professional licensing requirements and other matters. If a violation of the terms of an applicable contractual provision occurs, a contractor may be disbarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for specified periods of time. We have never been disbarred or suspended from seeking procurements by any governmental agency.
Health Care Reform
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“Affordable Care Act”), will likely have a dramatic effect on health care financing and insurance coverage for Americans. A portion of the Affordable Care Act, referred to as the “Physician Sunshine Payment” provisions, requires applicable manufacturers and distributors of drugs, devices, biological, or medical supplies covered under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Department of Health and Human Services certain payments or other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. They also require applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report certain information regarding the ownership or investment interests held by physicians or the immediate family members of physicians in such entities. Final regulations implementing the Physician Sunshine Payment provisions were issued on February 8, 2013 and became effective on April 9, 2013. The required data was required to be reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services by March 31, 2014. Civil monetary penalties apply for failure to report payments, transfers of value, or physician ownership interests. The Company had no issues with the implemented Affordable Care Act.
 
Risk Management
 
The testing, marketing and sale of human healthcare products entails an inherent risk of product liability claims. In the normal course of business, product liability claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events unknown at the present time. We have obtained and maintain insurance with respect to product liability claims in amounts we believe are appropriate. However, product liability claims, product recalls, litigation in the future, regardless of outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that our risk management practices are reasonably adequate to protect against reasonable product liability losses. However, unanticipated catastrophic losses could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
Competitive Conditions
 
We compete with many companies in the molecular diagnostics industry and the homeland defense and clinical markets. We believe that Luminex Corporation, Cepheid, Roche, BioMerieux, and Thermo Fisher Scientific will be competitors for our molecular diagnostics products. We believe Welch Allyn, Braun and Exergen, which markets a line of oral, infrared, tympanic and axillary thermometers, is our main competitor in the clinical-use thermometry market. In our ENG business, we believe our competitors include GermFree Laboratories, Inc., LDV Inc., and Farber Specialty Vehicles.
 
Key characteristics of our markets include long operating cycles and intense competition, which is evident through the number of bid protests (competitor protests of U.S. government procurement awards) and the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities. It is common in the homeland defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among several companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor, become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company. It is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and, simultaneously, perform as a supplier to, or a customer of, that same competitor on other contracts, or vice versa.

Research and Development
 
The principal objectives of our research and development program are to develop high-value molecular diagnostic products such as Firefly Dx and M-BAND, as well as to improve the accuracy of our thermometer products so that we can complete development of and introduce our next-generation line of human thermometers to healthcare professionals and institutions. We focus our efforts on five main areas: 1) engineering efforts to extend the capabilities of our systems and to develop new systems; 2) assay development efforts to design, optimize and produce specific tests that leverage the systems and chemistry we have developed; 3) target discovery research to identify novel micro RNA targets to be used in the development of future assays; 4) chemistry research to develop innovative and proprietary methods to design and synthesize oligonucleotide primers, probes and dyes to optimize the speed, performance and ease-of-use of our assays; and 5) developing hardware and software for all our new thermometer models, and further clinical studies for validation.
Employees
 
As of March 22, 2017, we had 29 full-time employees, of which 3 were in management; 5 were in finance and administration; 5 in sales, marketing and business development; 6 in research, development and engineering; and 10 in manufacturing. We consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory and have not experienced any interruptions of our operations as a result of labor disagreements. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.
