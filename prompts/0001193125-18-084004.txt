Item 1. Business 
 Inland Land Appreciation Fund II, L.P. (the Partnership) was formed on June 28, 1989 to invest in undeveloped land on an all-cash basis and realize appreciation of such land upon resale. On October 25, 1989, we commenced an offering of 30,000 (subject to an increase to 60,000) limited partnership units, or units, at $1,000 per unit, pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-11 under the Securities Act of 1933. On October 24, 1991, we terminated our offering of units, after we sold 50,476.17 units, at $1,000 per unit, resulting in $50,476,170 in gross offering proceeds, not including our general partners capital contribution of $500. All of the holders of our units were admitted to our Partnership. Inland Real Estate Investment Corporation is our general partner. Our limited partners share in their portion of benefits of ownership of our real property investments according to the number of units held. Through December 31, 2017, we had repurchased a total of 408.65 units for $383,822 from various limited partners through the unit repurchase program. 
 We purchased on an all-cash basis, twenty-seven parcels of undeveloped land and two buildings and are engaged in the rezoning and resale of the parcels. On September 16, 2002, we completed a tax-deferred exchange of Parcels 9 and 12 for 50 acres in Kendall County (Parcel 28). All of the investments were made in the Chicago metropolitan area. The anticipated holding period of the land was approximately two to seven years from the completion of the land portfolio acquisitions. As a result of the lengthy rezoning and entitlement processes and the no growth mentality of the municipalities where the land is located our holding period has exceeded our original estimates. Through December 31, 2017, we have had multiple sales transactions, disposing of approximately 4,486 acres of the approximately 4,530 acres originally owned. 
 We are engaged in the business of real estate investment which management considers being a single operating segment. A presentation of information about operating segments would not be material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, we had no land sales. On April 15, 2016, the Partnership sold the remaining acreage of Parcel 8, resulting in net sales proceeds of $1,614,552. On November 17, 2016, the Partnership sold the farmland portion of Parcel 20, resulting in net sales proceeds of $2,084,246. There were two distributions of net sales proceeds during 2016 totaling $3,553,189. Net sales proceeds, including previously undistributed net sales proceeds, were used to fund our operations including land improvements and land use activities. 
 On January 10, 2017, the Partnership entered into a Real Estate Purchase and Sale Agreement with a third party purchaser for the sale of approximately 30 acres of Parcel 20 at a sales price of $2,800,000. The contract was contingent on the purchaser obtaining necessary municipal approvals for a multi-family development. The agreement was amended to extend the due diligence period and the time period for purchaser to obtain such municipal approvals. An amendment also documented an agreed upon reduction of the original sales price to $2,425,000 following results of soil testing during due diligence. The purchaser waived all contingencies on January 24, 2018 and the sale closed on February 23, 2018. 
 On February 23, 2018, the Partnership entered into a Contract of Sale with an affiliate of the Partnerships general partner for the balance of Parcel 20 for a sales price of $715,410. The sale closed on March 5, 2018. 
 The Partnership will make a final liquidating distribution of net sales proceeds and remaining working capital reserve less an amount sufficient to cover the costs associated with closing the Partnership. The distribution is expected to occur by March 31, 2018. 
 We had no employees during 2017. Accordingly, we hired no compensation consultants. 
 Our general partner and its affiliates provide services to us. Our general partner and its affiliates are reimbursed for salaries and expenses of employees of the general partner and its affiliates relating to the administration of the Partnership. An affiliate of the general partner performs land improvements, rezoning, annexation and other activities to prepare our parcels for sale and is reimbursed for salaries and direct costs.

  Item 1(A). Risk Factors 
 Pre-Development Stage Land 
 The net proceeds of the offering were invested in pre-development stage land. An investment in such land involves a number of potential risks, which include the following: 
 Environmental Risks. Federal and state environmental laws can impose substantial liability on owners of real estate without regard to fault, even when other parties are or were responsible for the environmental impairment. Environmental liabilities could cause us to incur significant expenses, including (but not limited to) the obligation to remedy or clean up hazardous substances (such as pesticides commonly used on farmland) or other pollutants, regardless of fault. 
 Limited Current Income. With the exception of limited amounts of cash which may be generated from certain revenue-producing activities, pre-development land does not generate current income. Nevertheless, we incur ongoing expenses in connection with the ownership of such land (for example, real estate taxes and insurance). 
 Litigation. We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such litigation. An unfavorable outcome could negatively impact our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Partnership-Related Risks 
 No Market for Units. Our units are subject to certain restrictions on transferability. As a result of these restrictions, no public trading market is likely to develop for these securities, nor is one intended to develop. Purchasers of units may not, therefore, be able to liquidate their investment, and units may not be readily acceptable as collateral for a loan. 
 Transfer Limit. In accordance with Article XVI Section 16.1 of the Inland Land Appreciation Fund II, L.P. Partnership Agreement and Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(j), we reached the maximum threshold of limited partnership units that may be transferred/assigned directly between parties during 2017. For the benefit of interested limited partners, we have a relationship with a qualified matching service as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(g). In accordance with this Treasury Regulation and the IRS private letter ruling obtained by the qualified matching service, we understand that limited partnership units may be transferred or assigned through the qualified matching service up to a separate maximum threshold each taxable year (in addition to the maximum threshold that may be transferred or assigned directly between parties under our partnership agreement and Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(j)). However, there can be no assurance that the IRS private letter ruling will apply to transfers of our units, or that any particular transfer will not violate the transfer restrictions contained in the partnership agreement or the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(g). If you have any interest in participating in a transfer/assignment of partnership units through this qualified matching service, please contact Central Trade and Transfer directly at 877-704-6737. You are strongly encouraged to consult your personal legal, financial and tax advisors in connection with any such transfer/assignment.

Conflicts of Interest. We may be subject to various conflicts of interest arising out of our relationship with our general partner and its affiliates. If the general partner or its affiliates breach their fiduciary obligations to us, or do not resolve these conflicts of interest to our benefit, we could suffer consequences which we might not otherwise be subject to if such conflicts of interest did not exist. 
Federal Income Tax Aspects 
 Potential Receipt of UBTI. The incurrence of debt in connection with our pre-development and/or sales activities could cause the gain on the sale of our parcel to constitute unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) and affect limited partners that are tax-exempt entities. 
 Tax liabilities may be greater than cash distributions. Each limited partner will be required to report the limited partners allocable share of our taxable net income on the limited partners personal tax return, regardless of whether the limited partner has received any cash distributions from us. Thus, limited partners may incur taxes associated with their proportional share of our net income even though we have not distributed cash to pay the taxes. 
 Item 1(B). Unresolved Staff Comments 
 Not applicable.
