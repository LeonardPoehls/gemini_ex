Overview
 
TTSI Corporate History
 
Cell Source, Inc. (the "Company") is a Nevada corporation formed on June 6, 2012 under the name Ticket to See, Inc. ("TTSI"). Prior to the Share Exchange (as defined below), we did not have any significant assets or operations. Cell Source, Inc. is the parent company of Cell Source Ltd. ("Cell Source Israel"). Cell Source Israel was founded in Israel in 2011 in order to commercialize a suite of inventions relating to certain cancer treatments.
Share Exchange
 
On June 30, 2014 (the “Closing Date”), TTSI entered into and closed a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Cell Source Israel and 100% of the shareholders of Cell Source Israel (the “CSL Shareholders”) whereby Cell Source Israel became the wholly-owned subsidiary of TTSI and TTSI changed its name to Cell Source, Inc. (the “Share Exchange”), and whereby certain CSL Shareholders, holding 18,245,923 of the outstanding shares of Cell Source Israel, transferred to the Company an aggregate of 18,245,923 shares of Cell Source Israel’s ordinary shares, each of nominal value of NIS 0.01 (“CSL Ordinary Shares”) in exchange for an aggregate of 18,245,923 newly issued shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Company Common Stock” or the “Common Stock”). The aggregate of 18,245,923 shares of newly issued Company Common Stock represented 78.5% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock following the Closing Date. In addition, outstanding five (5) year warrants to acquire 4,859,324 CSL Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $0.75 per share (the “CSL Warrants”) were exchanged for newly issued warrants to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the “Company Warrants”), which Company Warrants contain substantially similar terms as the CSL Warrants. In addition, outstanding warrants to acquire 2,043,835 CSL Ordinary Shares held by Yair Reisner, Ph.D. and Yeda Research and Development Company Limited were exchanged for warrants to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the “Researcher Company Warrants”), which Researcher Company Warrants contain substantially similar terms as their warrants to acquire CSL Ordinary Shares. The aggregate of 6,903,159 Company Warrants and Researcher Company Warrants represented 77.5% of the outstanding warrants to purchase Common Stock of the Company following the Closing Date.
Cell Source Israel's Private Placement
 
Beginning in November 2013, Cell Source Israel collected and entered into a series of subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreement”) with certain accredited investors (the “Investors”) in a private placement offering (the “Private Placement”). Cell Source Israel held closings of the Private Placement between December 9, 2013 through April 7, 2014, pursuant to which Cell Source Israel sold an aggregate of 4,759,324 Units (the "Units"), at a purchase price of $0.75 per Unit, for gross proceeds of $3,569,475. Each Unit consisted of one (1) share of CSL Ordinary Shares and one (1) CSL Warrant. Each CSL Warrant entitled the holder to purchase one (1) share of CSL Ordinary Shares for a five (5) year period at an exercise price of $0.75 per share.
 
Under the Subscription Agreement, the Investors were granted the following rights for a period of five (5) years commencing on the closing of the Private Offering: (i) in the event any shares of CSL Ordinary Shares or securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for CSL Ordinary Shares are issued at a price less than $0.75 per share (“Adjustment Event”), subject to certain adjustments, then additional CSL Ordinary Shares, or equivalents, will be issued to the Investors such that the aggregate holdings of the Investors is equal to the aggregate holding had such Investors initially purchased at the applicable lower price by which securities were issued in the Adjustment Event (except that certain issuances set forth in the Subscription Agreement would not be an Adjustment Event); and (ii) upon any financing by Cell Source whereby CSL Ordinary Shares or securities convertible into CSL Ordinary Shares are issued or sold (a “Subsequent Financing”), Investors have the right to participate in such Subsequent Financing (subject to customary exemptions).  The Investors were also granted the right to elect up to two (2) independent board members. On May 29, 2014, the majority of the Investors granted certain groups of shareholders the right to elect, subject to the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement, Yoram Drucker, Itamar Shimrat, David Zolty, Ben Friedman and Dennis Brown to the Board of Directors of the Company. Furthermore, pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, in the event that the Registration Statement, as defined below, was declared effective, the Company was obligated to issue to certain founders of Cell Source Israel (Isaac Braun, Saar Dickman, Itamar Shimrat and Yoram Drucker) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.75 per share, subject to the same adjustments and terms as the Company Warrants.
 
 3
 

In connection with the Private Placement, Cell Source Israel also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with the Investors, pursuant to which Cell Source Israel agreed to file a registration statement (the “Registration Statement”), registering for resale (i) all CSL Ordinary Shares, or securities into which they were exchanged, that were included in the Units; and (ii) all CSL Ordinary Shares, or equivalent securities, issuable upon exercise of the Investor Warrants or upon exercise of warrants into which the Investor Warrants were exchanged. The Company filed the Registration Statement on August 8, 2014 and it was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 10, 2014.
 
As a result of the Share Exchange, the Company assumed the obligations of Cell Source Israel under the Subscription Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement.
 
The foregoing descriptions of the Private Placement and related agreements and transactions do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete text of such agreements.
 
Implications of being an Emerging Growth Company
 
As a company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012. An “emerging growth company” may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:
 
 
· | being permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this report on Form 10-K;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We may take advantage of these provisions until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, which such fifth anniversary will occur in 2018. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a “large accelerated filer,” our annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period.
 
We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to “opt out” of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that this decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
 
Notwithstanding the above, we are also currently a “smaller reporting company”, meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, nor a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company, and has a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. Some of the reduced disclosure and other requirements available to us as a result of the JOBS Act may continue to be available to us after we are no longer considered an “emerging growth company”. Specifically, similar to “emerging growth companies”, “smaller reporting companies” are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as an “emerging growth company” or “smaller reporting company” may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.

Cell Source Israel Corporate History
 
Prior to the Share Exchange, Cell Source Israel was a privately held company located in Tel Aviv, Israel. Cell Source Israel was founded in 2011 in order to commercialize a suite of inventions that were the result of over ten (10) years of research at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel (“Weizmann Institute”). Pursuant to a Research and License Agreement by and between Cell Source Israel and Yeda Research and Development Company Limited ("Yeda"), dated October 3, 2011, as amended in April, 2014 November, 2016, and., most recently, in March, 2018 (the “Yeda License Agreement”), Yeda, the commercial arm of the Weizmann Institute, granted Cell Source Israel an exclusive license to certain patents, discoveries, inventions, and other intellectual property generated (together with others) by Yair Reisner, Ph.D. (“Dr. Reisner”), former head of the Immunology Department at the Weizmann Institute.
Our Business
 
We are a cell therapy company focused on immunotherapy. Our technology seeks to address one of the most fundamental challenges within human immunology:  how to tune the immune response such that it tolerates selected desirable foreign cells, but continues to attack all other (undesirable) targets.  In simpler terms, many potentially life-saving treatments have limited effectiveness today because the patient’s immune system rejects them. Today, rejection is partially overcome using aggressive immune suppression treatments that leave the patient exposed to many dangers by compromising their immune system. The ability to overcome rejection without having to compromise the rest of the immune system may open the door to effective treatment of a number of severe medical conditions which are characterized by this need. These include:

· | Haematological malignancies (leukemias, lymphomas, etc.). One of the most effective treatments for these conditions is bone marrow transplantation. However, this is a risky and difficult procedure primarily because of potential conflicts between host and donor immune systems and also due to viral infections that often follow even successful bone marrow transplantations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The broader set of cancers, including solid tumors, that can potentially be treated effectively using genetically modified cells such as CAR-T cells, but also face efficacy and economic constraints due to limited persistence based on immune system issues.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Organ failure and transplantation. A variety of conditions can be treated by the transplantation of vital organs. However, transplantation is limited both by the problem of rejection and an insufficient supply of available donor organs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Non-malignant haematological conditions (such as sickle cell anemia) which could, in many cases, also be effectively treated by bone marrow transplantation if the procedure did not pose such threatening conflicts between host and donor immune systems.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Haematological Malignancies
 
Haematological malignancies (blood cancers) comprise a variety of lymphomas and leukemias. A very important treatment protocol for these malignancies involves the use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (“HSCT”). To the best of our knowledge, over 1,000,000 bone marrow transplantations have been performed worldwide with the annual number of procedures exceeding 60,000 (table below). Our technology will be immediately applicable to, at a minimum, the roughly 30,000 worldwide bone marrow transplants that are allogeneic (using cells taken from another individual).

HSCT often has a curative effect when successful. However, it is very risky. HSCT involves destroying the patient’s native immune system with radiation or chemotherapy (myeloablation) before the transplantation, and then suppressing immune response (immunosuppression) with drugs to manage the conflicts between host and donor cells, often for the rest of the patient’s life. The majority of patients are unable to find a matched family donor. Approximately 35-40% of all unrelated donor transplant patients die within two years of transplantation.  Among those who die in the first 100 days post-transplant, 30% die from either infections (associated with a compromised immune system) or GVHD (Graft Versus Host Disease).
 
 6
 



Myeloablation and immunosuppression are dangerous and difficult to tolerate, especially in patients over age 50. Therefore HSCT has been used mainly with younger patients
 
 This means that:
 
 
a) | many blood cancer patients are not candidates for the primary treatment (HSCT) that represents a potential cure;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b) | there is high mortality among those patients who are candidates for HSCT and do undergo the procedure; and
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c) | those patients who successfully undergo and survive HSCT take dangerous, expensive, and quality-of-life reducing immunosuppression medications, typically for a prolonged period of time.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



There is widespread awareness of the need for improved immune-system management technologies for HSCT - both to improve outcomes of transplantations for the traditional target set of patients and to expand the use of the procedure by making transplantation safe enough to become appropriate for a broader set of patients.
 
We aspire to use Veto Cell technology to dramatically improve the outcomes of the allogeneic transplantations already being performed, and thereby to rapidly penetrate the current market. However, our target population greatly exceeds those patients who currently undergo HSCT, as the firm’s tolerizing technology could potentially make allogeneic transplantation an option for a much larger proportion of the diseased population. The following table shows the prevalence of the specific haematological malignancies on which we will focus:
 

Initial Malignancy Indications (note estimates for North America and EU only) | Prevalence (Number patients) | | Annual Bone Marrow Transplantations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------+-----------+------------------------------------
Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma | | 920,460 | | 15,017
Multiple Myeloma | | 216,784 | | 20,654
Leukemia | | 586,671 | | 18,582
Total | | 1,723,915 | | 54,253

For the purposes of this report, it is assumed that the immediate candidates for Cell Source-enabled HSCT will be the subset of cancer patients that today receive transplantations as part of their cancer treatment (rightmost column in table above). We believe that a portion of these patients will benefit from Veto Cell adjunct therapy, as such therapy aspires to improve the success and reduce the risk and mortality of a procedure that they are having anyway. With time, as Veto Cell treatment becomes more widespread and data is accumulated, we believe that the percentage of patients that will be referred for Veto Cell enabled HSCT will increase significantly.
 
It is also important to note that incidence of these diseases is increasing. The global market for hematological malignancies was estimated at $27 billion in 2015 and is projected to increase in size to over $50 billion by 2024 according to "Hematological Malignancies Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016 - 2024." Published by Transparency Market Research.  The aging of the US population and the increased incidence of hematologic malignancies are expected to significantly increase the number of older patients who receive allogeneic HSCT.
 
HSCT Market Trends
 
There are four important market trends affecting the hematological malignancies market:
 
 
1) | As noted above, increasing incidence of these disorders in the West, largely driven by the aging population.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Improvement and proliferation of HSCT treatments.
---+--------------------------------------------------


3) | A “virtuous circle” of lowered death rate due to better transplantations leading to more aggressive focus on HSCT.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | The growing use of milder conditioning regimens, which makes the procedure more survivable for older patients (see table below).
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




However, despite the above trends, the use of HSCT, especially allogeneic, remains limited because of the risks associated with the myeloablative treatments required to reduce the host immune response and GVHD. This means that the “gold-standard” of treatment is largely unavailable to the age cohort that makes up the majority of sufferers of these diseases.
 

 8
 
The Company aspires to address this issue in a distinctive manner by significantly reducing the need for myeloablative treatment and avoiding the risk of GVHD, thereby improving the outlook for allogeneic transplantations and enabling their use in a much larger population set.
 
Relevant Non-Malignant Diseases
 
While Hematological malignancies represent the Company's initial focus, the Company's selective immune response blocking technology may also be effective in treating certain non-malignant organ diseases as well as blood and immune system disorders. This would represent an additional growth opportunity for the Company.
 
The target non-malignant diseases are widespread. The Company's first non-malignant disorder target is expected to be is support of organ transplantations (kidney, liver, etc.). Approximately 60,000 such procedures are conducted in North America and the EU each year. As with bone marrow transplantations, organ transplantations require substantial immunosuppression to prevent rejection. This ongoing treatment is dangerous, quality-of-life reducing, and costly. The Company's Veto Cell technology can potentially be used to selectively reduce immune response to the transplanted organ, thus reducing the need for aggressive immunosuppression post transplantation.
 
A second target within non-malignant disorders are blood diseases such as sickle cell disease and aplastic anemia. This is a serious and relatively common disease.  Sickle cell anemia can be treated by HSCT which replaces the defective bone marrow cells. However, because of HSCT’s riskiness, the procedure is currently used only in extreme cases. If successful in enabling safer HSCT, the Company will make this treatment available to a broader set of sickle cell anemia sufferers. As the therapy would be introduced in the form of bone marrow transplantation, we assume that only patients with relatively severe forms of the disease will initially be candidates. As such, only a minority of sickle cell anemia patients will be treatment candidates.
 
 Market Access and Channels
 
The market for transplantation therapies is relatively concentrated. There are approximately 1,600 transplantation centers worldwide, of which some 700 are in North America and Western Europe.
 
A relatively small subset of these (often termed “Centers of Excellence”) tends to set the practice standards for the entire transplantation community. Therefore, as discussed in the “Strategy” section, the Company plans to focus its initial penetration strategy on a relatively small group of influential centers.
 
Reimbursement issues for our therapies are expected to be relatively straightforward. Once clinical effectiveness and regulatory approval are established, the value-proposition for payors and providers is expected to be clear and compelling. Issues connected with immunosuppression and rejection constitute a major component of bone marrow transplantation costs, and significant improvement in this area is expected to bring substantive cost-savings for payors.
 
Sector Focus
 
We are in the general space of immunotherapy.  The cancer immunotherapy market was estimated at $37 billion for 2015 and projected to grow to $125 billion by 2024, according to Transparency Market Research.
 
Within the immunotherapy field, our initial focus is on allogeneic therapies (treatments using donor derived-as opposed to patient derived-cells), with a focus on haploidentical transplantations (transplantations that use cells from partially matched-as opposed to fully matched-donors and recipients). While potentially valuable, allogeneic therapies are relatively complex, risky, and expensive. A key driver of this complexity and associated costs is the conflict between host and donor immune systems, as discussed above.
 
Our technology, which in preclinical studies, and in the case of the Megadose Drug Combination in a first-in-human proof of concept, has shown the ability to enable tolerance of donor cells without affecting other immune processes, is fundamentally enabling. We expect it to significantly increase the safety, reduce the cost, and therefore broaden the scope of indications for such procedures.
 
Over time, we aspire to apply these technologies to autologous therapies (the processing and re-transplantation of an individual’s own cells) for example for the treatment of B cell malignancies. All of these treatments would take the form of non-invasive cell suspension treatments administered intravenously. The currently planned treatment modality of fully personalized medicine (i.e., using the patient’s own cells or those of a donor provided expressly by that patient) could, in some cases, eventually be supplanted by a more generic “off the shelf” modality offering which would be marketed as a pre-packaged suspension of cells and medium, taken and stored in advance for each cell “type” and then shipped to patients with the same “type” who have never met the donor. This delivery model is a longer term aspiration for us and is beyond the scope of our current market share projections.

Our Value Drivers
 
Our current positioning in the cancer immunotherapy value chain is typical of an early clinical stage company: developing, validating and attaining regulatory approvals for the various applications of our technology platforms. Going forward, once the products are commercialized, physician and patient interest in these treatments is expected to drive insurer reimbursement for patients - a key demand lever. The generic value chain for biotechnology development commences with an invention which is formulated, patented and successful in pre-clinical animal trials. We have already passed this stage with our Veto Cell technology platform, for which we have an exclusive license to use from Yeda, the owner of these patents. The next steps in development include human trials (first testing safety and then efficacy). Finally, the offering earns regulatory approval and patient treatment, along with the ensuing revenues, can commence. This can be a particularly lengthy process in the United States and therefore some medical treatments are approved in Europe or Asia and generate revenues there prior to commencing U.S. sales. Recently passed “fast track” regulation in the U.S. is aimed at getting critical treatments for life threatening conditions to patients more quickly.
 
Our successful preclinical validation of the Veto Cell treatment involved basic laboratory research including both in-vivo (live) animal trials and in-vitro (in a glass dish) human cell trials. This validates the protocol prior to commencing human clinical trials. Human clinical trials fine-tune the treatment protocol and confirm both safety and efficacy in treating patents. In parallel, the patents on the core technology go into the national phase in various countries and are emended with claims associated with exact treatment protocols, bolstering the protection afforded by already issued patents on the base technology.
 
In some cases, successful biotech companies have been able to capitalize on positive human clinical results (even prior to full approval for patient treatment) by either signing lucrative non-dilutive distribution option deals or by being partially or fully acquired by larger market participants. KITE Pharmaceuticals was acquired outright by Gilead Sciences in 2017 for $11.9 billion in cash, prior to having attained FDA approval and prior to commencing any product sales.  There is no indication or assurance that we are currently under consideration for any option or acquisition deal.
 
We plan to commence human clinical trials for approval for the Veto Cell based treatments in the United States in 2018. We have had positive preclinical results for three of our cell therapy treatments. Yeda, the proprietary owners of the patents underlying our technologies from whom we license our patents, has been granted patents for its original Veto Cell. The revised versions of the Veto Cell are the subject of patent applications which have been granted in some jurisdictions and are pending in others. These newer patent applications leverage the priority of the already granted patents.  We plan to conduct human clinical trials. If these trials are successful, they will demonstrate both safety (the patients survived and were not harmed) and initial indications of efficacy (there are signs of successful engraftment, and in the case of cancer patients prolonging the progression free period).
 
Science and Technology Overview
 
The patent portfolio that we license from Yeda, includes a variety of cell therapy applications. The portfolio includes both granted and pending patents.  The total relevant patent portfolio consists of 12 patent “families” (i.e. grouping of similar patent applications in different territorial jurisdictions) which currently include 37 granted patents, 2 allowed patents and a further 42 pending patents. The key terms of the agreement pursuant to which we license all of Yeda’s patents related to our technology is set forth in the section entitled “Intellectual Property” herein. The license period (per product, per country) is for the full life of the patents, and expires at the later of the patent expiration date in that country or 15 years after the date that the FDA or local equivalent regulatory authority in each country approves that particular product for sale in that country. As long as Cell Source either continues or sponsor research or pays either a nominal license fee of $50,000 per year (total for use of all the products) or pays royalties on product sales on at least one product as per the license agreement, the license will remain in effect continuously and expire only with the expiration of the patent or 15 years after regulatory approval (later of the two) per product per country as described above. Cell Source voluntarily sponsors research at the Weizmann Institute for the sake of developing its products and treatments from initial invention through to finalization of human treatment protocols. Cell Source extended the initial research period, which originally terminated in October 2014, for an additional four years through October 2018.  Furthermore, it plans to sponsor research at the Weizmann Institute through June, 2019.
 
Professor Yair Reisner, the inventor of Veto Cell technology, has recently left the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and relocated to the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. He has been awarded a $6 million grant from the Cancer Research and Prevention Institute of Texas. This coupled with research funding from the University itself, provides him with a total funding commitment of $10 million for five years. Professor Reisner has been hired to lead the research at the Department of Stem Cell Transplantation & Cellular Therapy at MD Anderson.
 
Cell Source plans to sponsor ongoing research by Professor Reisner and his team, some of whom have also relocated from the Weizmann Institute to MD Anderson, for developing existing and new applications for Veto Cell technology, and to license any new Veto Cell intellectual property developed there on an exclusive basis, as it does from Yeda.
 

 10
 
MD Anderson is the largest HSCT center in the United States, performing over 1,000 transplantations per year.  Cell Source plans to conduct human clinical trials for its Anti-Rejection Anti-viral Veto Cell at MD Anderson Cancer Center commencing in 2018. Professor Richard Champlin, who Chairs their Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and is a longtime associate and collaborator of Professor Reisner, is meant to serve as Principal Investigator for these trials.
 
Although Yeda has applied for and been granted various patents related to our technology, a granted patent only provides Yeda, and the Company by virtue of its exclusive license, the right to use the underlying invention. However, in order for our cell-therapy and cancer therapy to be legally sold and administered to patients, the FDA or similar regulatory agencies must approve its use. In other words, having a patent provides legal “freedom to operate” for a certain technology, and may provide the ability to prevent others from using the same technology without the patent holder’s permission. However, in order to legally manufacture and distribute products, a company must go through all of the typical approval steps delineated in the “Overview” section above.
 
The following sections provide an overview of each platform. Further information on the underlying science is available upon written request and the execution of an appropriate nondisclosure agreement.
 
Our licensed technology portfolio consists of 12 patent families, 37 granted patents, 2 allowed patents and a further 42 pending patents. The following table lists the patents and patent applications that Yeda holds and which we have a license to use in each of the below-referenced countries:

Veto Cell Technology Platform
 
Background
 
Our Veto Cell technology is a next generation immunotherapy technology that enables the selective attenuation of the immune system. In other words, pre-clinical studies suggest that the treatment has the ability to reduce the immune response to selective “threats,” with low risk for adverse side effects.
 
What makes the Veto Cell approach distinctive is the degree to which it leverages the inherent specificity of the human immune system. The immune system defends the body by creating a specific stream of T-cell clones for each of millions of individual threats. A given T-cell will attack only its specific target, ignoring all other threats. Our technology might enable the physician to selectively attenuate immune response, thus effectively “switching-off” an individual stream of T-cell clones without affecting any other such streams of T-cell clones dispatched by the immune system to attack unwanted incursions. The technology is based on the discovery that certain T-cells have the property of attracting and proactively neutralizing immune attacks on them.
 
The technology has achieved distinctive results in animal live trial models. See, e.g., Thorsten Zenz, Exhausting T cells in CLL, BLOOD, Feb. 28, 2013, at 1485. If it succeeds in human clinical trials, we believe that it may have meaningful and potentially broad impact on the field of bone marrow transplantation:
 
 
1) | Significantly improve outcomes of transplantations by reducing host rejection rate of T-cell depleted bone marrow, markedly reducing both the risk of GVHD and the need for using aggressive amounts of immunosuppression medications, as well as preventing viral infections that typically threaten patients post transplantation. This would significantly reduce the HSCT transplant mortality rate and therefore lead to broader use of this treatment.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Substantively increase the number of transplantations by enabling lower myeloablative conditioning and therefore making the therapy accessible to older and sicker patients (who today may not survive ablation).
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Further increase the number of transplantations by making transplantation appropriate for other indications (for which today transplantation would be considered an inappropriately risky treatment).
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In addition, our Veto Cell technology may possibly play a role in the treatment of a number of serious and currently poorly treated non-malignant diseases. Furthermore, initial animal trials have shown potential anti-lymphoma activity.  Finally, based on preclinical studies with using genetically modified cells, we believe that Veto Cells will be able to act as critical enabler for other cell therapies being developed by third parties, most notably CAR-T cell therapy, which has recently shown strong initial indications of being effective in cancer treatment.
  
Yeda Research & Development Ltd. (Yeda), the commercial arm of the Weizmann Institute of Science, has filed two patent applications that extend the usage of Veto Cell technology as a critical enabler for other cell therapy treatments.  These patents are have recently entered the national phase. One patent application highlights, based on preclinical data, the ability of Veto Cells to accompany other cell therapy treatments and help them overcome rejection and avoid Graft vs. Host Disease (GVHD) in an allogeneic (using a third party donor) treatment setting. The other patent application involves a genetically modified Veto Cell that can have sustained survival in the patient’s body while avoiding rejection and GVHD. Both of these applications holds the potential to make CAR-T cells, which to date been effective primarily in an autologous (patient’s own cells) setting, succeed in an allogeneic setting. What follows is a description of the significance of these two new patent applications:
 

  
· | Gene modified cell therapy is considered to be one of the most promising cancer treatment approaches in decades, with companies like Kite Pharma and JUNO Therapeutics having recently been acquired at multi-billion dollar valuations after having successfully treated relatively small numbers of patients in clinical trails. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | While gene modified treatments such as CAR-T have shown remarkable results in cancer treatment trials, their published successes to date have been mostly limited to “autologous” blood cell cancer treatments using the patient’s own cells. There are concerns that this type of “personalized” treatment may not have favorable economics on a large scale basis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The ideal more lucrative commercial path for CAR-T and similar genetically engineered cell therapies is to become “allogeneic” or off-the-shelf product with drug-like distribution economics and to treat a broad spectrum of cancers including solid tumors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Preclinical data show that Veto Cells can help genetically modified T-cells from the same donor to overcome rejection issues (among the problems exhibited to date by CAR-T therapy in an allogeneic setting), hence significantly increasing their persistence (longevity) and thus their efficacy in eradicating cancer. Based on this preclinical data, Cell Source believes that Veto Cells could potentially enable the use of Off-the-shelf CAR-T cells directed against malignant cells. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cell Source has recently begun a collaboration, through its licensing agreement with Yeda, with Professor Zelig Eshhar, the inventor of CAR-T cells. Professor Eshhar has served as both a scientist at the Weizmann Institute and on the Scientific Advisory Board of KITE Pharma.  This collaboration is meant to confirm the strength of combining Veto Cell technology with CAR-T cell therapy.  Once the preclinical proof of concept is completed, Cell Source plans to produce its own independent off-the-shelf CAR-T + Veto cell treatment for both blood cell cancers and solid tumors.
  
Furthermore, Yeda has filed a patent application, licensed to Cell Source, for an Anti-viral Veto Cell.  Below is an explanation of the potential for this application:
 
  
· | Other than primary disease (typically blood cell cancer) the leading causes of death in unrelated donor bone marrow transplants are rejection, GVHD (Graft vs. Host Disease, where the donor bone marrow rejects the host or recipient), and infections, which collectively are responsible for 30% of deaths after unrelated donor transplants within the first 100 days post transplant.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | It is well established that GVHD can be prevented by T cell depletion of the bone marrow transplant. However, this procedure is also is associated with an increased rate of graft rejection. Preclinical studies clearly suggest that this problem can be overcome by adding Veto Cells to the bone marrow transplant. However, viruses such as CMV and EBV remain a major threat to patients post-transplant. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cell Source has developed a next generation Veto Cell that not only facilitates mismatched transplants but also protects the transplant recipient against these common viruses. During the initial period after a stem cell transplantation the patient’s body undergoes an immune system reconstitution period. While the “new” immune system is building up, the patient is particularly vulnerable to viral infections such as CMV, an infection that is typically development in about half of bone marrow transplant recipients during the first 100 days post transplantation. Veto cells can fend off CMV until such time as the patient’s own immune system reconstitutes to the point that it can fight off the infection on its own. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Combining GVHD prevention by using T cell depleted transplants with anti-rejection action as well as virus prevention, Veto Cell could potentially significantly increase survival rates post-transplant.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Based on preclinical data, veto cells can also be used to facilitate organ transplants (e.g. kidney transplant combined with a bone marrow transplant) with partially mismatched donors and either reduce or eliminate the need for lifelong daily anti-rejection treatment currently given to even fully matched donor organ recipients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cell Source is currently in the process of attaining regulatory validation for the production of its Anti-viral Veto Cells in Europe and plans to commence doing so in the US this year, with a view to commencing human clinical trials by the end of 2018.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mechanism
 
Our Veto Cell is a CD8 central memory anti-3rd party T-cell that has five critical properties:
 
 
1) | It has an outer surface coating that triggers attack by specific host T-cells (and only those specific T-cells).
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | It can annihilate an attacking T-cell without itself being damaged (specifically, it exposes or releases a death-signaling molecule when an attacking T-cell binds to it).
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | It has been oriented to attack cells of a simulated third party (i.e., neither host nor donor) and thus exhibits markedly reduced risk of GVHD or graft rejection.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | It is long-lived and endures in the body for extended periods.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------


5) | It migrates to the thymus and lymph nodes.
---+-------------------------------------------



The outcome is that when a large number of these cells are introduced into the body, they effectively eliminate the T-cell clones that the immune system dispatches to attack the desirable, transplanted bone marrow cells. Thus, for example, if a population of Veto Cells is derived from a donor, they will express the same peptide as do the donor’s cells. Therefore, the specific stream of host T-cells that would ordinarily attack the donor stem-cells, are instead directed to “decoy” Veto Cells and disabled before they reach the transplantation.
 
Described in a Blood editorial as a “substantial advance in Cell Therapy,” a notable characteristic of our Veto Cell is that this mechanism is quite specific. Only those specific T-cell clones that were generated to attack cells from this specific donor are disabled. The rest of the immune system essentially remains intact.
 
This is in marked contrast with conventional immunosuppression which degrades the entire immune system and is therefore associated with severe risk of infection and, in the case of bone marrow transplantations, high mortality.
 
 17
 
  

This effect is long-lived. Firstly, the Veto Cells themselves are long-lived memory cells. Secondly, when infused with bone marrow cells the latter migrate to the thymus where, over time, they create a new “identity” in the host and initiate “chimerism,” where the host and donor cells peacefully co-exist. This chimerism has the effect of "educating" new T-cells being generated by the thymus to tolerate donor cells and this tolerance can become permanent.  Furthermore, by inducing permanent tolerance to donor cells, Veto Cells may be able to enable both acceptance (i.e. mitigate both host rejection and GvH rejection) and thus persistence (i.e. extended survival resulting in enhanced efficacy) of important cell therapy treatments such as CAR-T cells, TCRs and NK cells in treating both blood cell and solid tumor cancers.  Beyond this, Veto Cells can be directed not only to kill host anti-donor rejecting cells, but also common viruses such as EBV and CMV that are a common cause of post-transplantation morbidity and mortality.
 
Target Indications
 
Our Veto Cell technology, an intravenously administered cell suspension, if successful, could initially be used in bone marrow and other transplantations associated with malignant disorders (i.e., cancers). At a later stage, Veto Cell technology may be applied to selected non-malignant conditions. The following sections provide a brief overview of the use of the Veto Cell technology in both of these scenarios.
 
i. Bone Marrow Transplantation
 
In order to describe the effect of Veto Cells in transplantation, it is helpful to first briefly review the state of the art:
 In a conventional bone marrow transplant, the recipient first receives myeloablative conditioning - powerful chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy intended to destroy his/her own bone marrow cells. This has a threefold purpose:

1) | It destroys the host T-cells so they will not attack (reject) the donor bone marrow cells.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | It makes space in the host bone marrow for the new donor cells.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------


3) | It destroys diseased host blood cells so that they do not proliferate and cause relapse following the procedure.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In practice however, there are three major problems:
 
 
· | Host rejection - the myeloablative conditioning does not destroy all of the host T-cells. Those that remain may aggressively attack the donor bone marrow cells before they can engraft.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | “Graft versus Host Disease” (GVHD) -the transplanted cells include donor T-cells which recognize the host's body as foreign and attack it.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Viral infections are a common complication from HSCT and result in 20% of early patients deaths in unrelated-donor transplants in the US
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Rejection, GVHD and viral infections are all potentially life-threatening complications in and of themselves and also lead to the use of dangerous and costly immunosuppression medications.
 
ii. Veto Cell in Transplantation
 
The Veto Cell technology addresses not only rejection but also GVHD and infections.  In a transplantation scenario, a population of donor Veto Cells is created to “escort” the bone marrow cells when they are transplanted. This population is created by identifying donor cells with Veto Cell properties, exposing them to simulated 3rd party cells (i.e., selecting only those that react to a third person and therefore by definition will not react to either host or donor), and expanding their population in the lab.
 
 18
 
  

The Veto Cells are then introduced into the host along with the transplanted stem cells. The host mounts its normal immune response to the donor cells by generating a population of T-cell clones that will bind to any cells expressing markers from this specific donor. In a conventional transplantation, these T-cells would bind to and destroy donor stem-cells thus causing rejection of the transplant.
 
However, when the transplantation is accompanied by large numbers of Veto Cells, this rejection mechanism is “ambushed.” Since the Veto Cells express the same donor markers as the stem-cells, the host T-cell clones will attempt to bind to the donor-derived Veto Cells as noted above, which act as decoys by attracting and then counterattacking and killing the clones before they ever reach the bone barrow transplantation.  These same Veto Cells can potentially be used to concurrently counterattack viruses such as CMV and EBT which are a common source of infections that threaten BMT patients. Based on additional preclinical data, in June of 2016 Yeda filed a U.S. provisional patent application, also licensed by Cell Source, which shows the ability of Veto Cells to be directed against these types of viruses typically cause infections in bone marrow transplant patients. This additional functionality, when combined with attacking host anti-donor rejecting cells, may even further enhance survival rates for patients.
 
iii. Direct Anti-Cancer Effect
 
HSCT are well known to be an effective treatment for hematological malignancies. Making these treatments safer and more accessible by reducing the need for harmful immune suppression, avoiding GVHD and fending off common post-transplantation viruses are expected to facilitate, through successful Veto Cell treatments, a broader and more successful use of HSCT for not only the most severe cases, but also for older or weaker patients who are not capable of tolerating high intensity conditioning (high levels of radiation and chemotherapy).  This is expected to significantly increase the number of patients who can receive successful cancer treatments that require allogeneic HSCT.
 
A further direct anti-tumor effect of Veto Cells, which complements and bolster the effect of HSCT as described above, has been noted in mouse and in-vitro studies: donor Veto Cells selectively attack host lymphoma malignant cells. This effect has been robust in animals, in fact completely eradicating lymphoma in mouse models (See – “Development Status” section below).
 
The direct anti-cancer effect has been documented for several human B cell malignant lines, however, preliminary experiments with human anti-3rd party veto cells prepared in a slightly different protocol than that used for the mouse studies, indicate that further optimization and verification are required before killing fresh human B-CLL or myeloma tumor cells could become a feasible option.
 
If this effect transfers to human patients, it may have significant therapeutic value for the above disorders, which as noted hereafter in the Marketing Strategy section, are among the largest blood cancer markets.
 
iv. Enabling Third Party Cell Therapies
 
Based on preclinical studies using genetically modified cells, in July of 2015 Yeda filed two U.S. provisional patent applications, which are also licensed exclusively by Cell Source on a worldwide basis.  These patent applications show the ability of Veto Cells to enhance the performance of cell therapy treatments involving genetically modified receptors.  When combined with CAR-T or TCR cell therapy for example, these would potentially greatly enhance the ability of these treatments to be used in an allogeneic or “off-the-shelf” setting, and also increase their efficacy by avoiding both rejection and GVHD, thus increasing their persistence (survival in the patient’s body).
 
This combined Veto Cell + CAR-T or similar treatment could result in broadly applicable effective treatments for many of the most prevalent solid tumor cancers and well as blood cell cancers.

v. In Non-Malignant Diseases
 
There are two major categories of non-malignant disorders that the Veto Cell technology aspires to address: organ transplantation and non-malignant hematological disorders.
 
In the case of organ transplantations and congenital non-malignant hematological disorders, the goal of the Veto Cells is to enable transplantation (bone marrow or organ) by reducing host/donor immune system conflicts.  This could potentially allow for mismatched (partial vs. full identity match between donor and host) kidney transplants, for example, and also obviate the need for lifelong daily anti-rejection medication which is the current standard of care. Such an outcome could improve quality of life, reduce cost of care and significantly increase life expectancy for a broader audience of prospective transplant recipients.
 
In the case of congenital non-malignant diseases such as sickle cell disease and aplastic anemia, the body’s bone marrow produces “flawed” cells. An effective treatment is HSCT which replaces the flawed host bone marrow with healthy donor cells. These cells then produce healthy blood cells, basically curing the anemia. As noted elsewhere however, today HSCT is a risky procedure because of the graft/host immune conflicts. It is therefore used infrequently to treat sickle cell disease. The Veto Cell tolerizing technology would increase the target population for this treatment by significantly reducing these conflicts and by extension the procedure’s risk. Likewise, if permanent tolerance to donor hematopoietic cells is induced under safe conditions, the new immune status could permit acceptance of a kidney from the same donor, without further requirement for a toxic immune suppression currently used in organ transplantation. This means that patients who today are required to take expensive and sometimes debilitating anti-rejection medication daily for the rest of their lives would no longer have to do so.
 
Development Status
 
The Veto Cell platform has been extensively tested by in vitro studies (on both human and mouse disease) and confirmed in animal trials. The results appear to be consistently effective.
 
1. Inducing chimerism:
 
The following images show some example data from the Veto Cell animal studies. Skin of black mice has been grafted onto the backs of white mice. The data show that T-cells from host and donor mice are fully coexisting in the treatment group using the Veto Cells (“chimerism”).
 

2. Successful bone marrow transplantation under reduced levels of immune suppression:
 
The anti-rejection effect in the data below shows mice with lymphoma treated with Veto Cell therapy.
 
The control group mice (left side) all die by day 27. By contrast, the Veto Cell treatment group (right side) show far better results.

Administration
 
We envision that Veto Cell therapy will be administered in an in-patient setting, typically as part of the existing preparation procedures for bone marrow transplantations. Blood will be taken from the donor. The frozen blood will be sent to a regional Company center where the Veto Cells will be developed and expanded - a process that lasts up to two weeks. The Veto Cells will then be sent to the transplantation center where they will be infused to the patient intravenously along with the transplantation.
Patent Status
 
The first generation Veto Cell is protected by granted patents in the US, Europe and Israel.  The second generation Veto Cell has granted patents in the US, Europe, China, Israel, India and the Russian Federation.  The third generation Veto Cell has various pending patents in various countries and, in various versions, has granted patents in the US, Europe, China, Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Mexico, South Africa, New Zealand and the Russian Federation.

 Products and Services
 
Currently, we do not have any products, and there is no assurance that we will be able to develop any products.
 
The following products are currently planned:
 
 
1. | Anti-rejection” Veto Cell tolerance therapy for both matched and mismatched allogeneic bone marrow transplantations.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is our flagship (as an initial platform for increasing transplantation success) and is focused on allogeneic bone marrow transplantations.
 Treatment will comprise a course of infusions of Veto Cells derived from the donor and processed in a Company (or subcontracted) facility that will be accessible to the transplantation center at the time of transplantation.
  
2. | Anti-cancer” Veto + CAR-T cell therapy for blood cell and solid tumor cancers.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This therapy is expected to comprise a course of infusions of donor derived cells that is expected to be combined with CAR-T cell therapy provided by a third party.
  
3. | Anti-rejection” Veto Cell tolerance therapy for both matched and mismatched organ transplantation.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This treatment would be combined with bone marrow transplantation in order to broaden the prospective donor pool and mitigate the need for chronic post-transplant anti-rejection therapy
  
4. | Veto Cell tolerance therapy for non-malignant disorders.
---+---------------------------------------------------------


This is the application of Veto Cell technology to treatment of non-malignant (i.e., non-cancerous) diseases. As discussed in the Technology section, a custom treatment would be developed for each selected disorder.
 Target indications for Veto Cell therapy for nonmalignant disorders are likely to be: tolerizing therapy for allogeneic transplantations for sickle cell anemia and aplastic anemia (by using bone marrow transplantations as referenced in no. 2 above) and tolerizing therapy for conventional organ transplantations.
 
Our Overall Development Status and Future Development Program
 
Prior to commercializing its products, the Company must conduct human clinical trials and obtain FDA approval and/or approvals from comparable foreign regulatory authorities.
 
Generally speaking, as a preclinical biotechnology firm, Cell Source needs to go through several necessary steps in order to commercialize its products and commence revenue generation. These steps are per product, but can run in parallel for multiple products, which are each in different stages of the development “pipeline”, so that, for example, when a certain product is already in a human clinical trial, another product may still be in preclinical development and a third may be awaiting regulatory approval to commence human trials. These can also take place in parallel, and varied stages, for the same product in different geographic jurisdictions. The typical steps per product (and range of time frame for each) are:

1) | Complete development of human treatment protocol (2-5 years)
---+-------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Apply for and receive approval to commence human trials (9-18 months)
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Recruit patients (1-6 months)
---+------------------------------


4) | Conduct Phase I trials showing safety of product (1-2 years)
---+-------------------------------------------------------------


5) | Apply for and receive approval to conduct trials showing product efficacy (6-12 months)
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6) | Data collecting and analysis (6-12 months)
---+-------------------------------------------


7) | Conduct Phase II efficacy trials (2-3 years)
---+---------------------------------------------


8) | Data collecting and analysis (6-12 months)
---+-------------------------------------------


9) | Apply for and receive approval to conduct trials showing efficacy in larger numbers of patients (6-12 months)
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


10) | Conduct Phase III efficacy trials with larger numbers of patients (2-4 years)
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


11) | Data collecting and analysis (6-12 months)
----+-------------------------------------------


12) | Apply for and receive approval for production scale manufacturing facilities (6-12 months)
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


13) | Contract third party or establish own production facilities (6-30 months)
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


14) | Contract third party or establish own distribution platform (6-18 months)
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


15) | Commence manufacturing and distribution (6-12 months)
----+------------------------------------------------------



Notably, steps 12-15 can be conducted in parallel with some of the steps above. In the case of Cell Source and other firms that treat terminal patients with either rare diseases or those for which there is currently no effective treatment, or where preclinical studies indicate a reasonable expectation to increase life expectancy and survival rates by a substantive margin, several of these steps can be combined and or shortened, subject to regulatory discretion. For example, Phase I and II (safety and efficacy) can be combined in a single concurrent step; approvals for subsequent steps can be accelerated; in some countries patients can already be treated commercially after the end of Phase II, foregoing the requirement for Phase III data.
 
The specific detailed next steps the company must take to get the treatments or products to market include the following:
 
In the case of the Megadose Drug Combination, the Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit of the University of Parma in Italy on May 14, 2014 requested and on October 23, 2014 obtained approval from the Italian Medicine Association (the Italian equivalent of the U.S. FDA) to conduct human clinical trials using the “Megadose + Drug Combination.” While we are not mentioned in the application nor in the approval, we may indirectly benefit from the outcome of the trial, if successful, although we are not the sponsor of this trial. There are no written or verbal agreements between the hospital and Cell Source regarding the use of the technology. That said, Cell Source is aware and in favor of the hospital plans to use the technology and would of course find a positive initial outcome encouraging. Since the treatment is being done on compassionate grounds as a non-commercial clinical trial, there is no legal requirement for the hospital to obtain approval to use the treatment protocol. The hospital has successfully treated the first cancer patient using the Megadose Drug Combination technology that Cell Source exclusively licenses from Yeda Research & Development Ltd., commercial arm of the Weizmann Institute of Science.  The patient who was suffering from late stage multiple myeloma, was released from hospital within a month of being treated and has since been cancer free for over two years, with no GVHD, as initially reported in Blood Advances, vol. 1 no. 24 2166-2175 which was published online October 27, 2017.
 
 22
 

While Cell Source is not a sponsor of the trial, the results provide a positive initial indication with respect to the technology. The patient received a bone marrow transplantation from a haploidentical or “mismatched” donor under a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (i.e., a relatively low level of immune suppression treatment). There was successful initial engraftment of the transplantation in the absence of GVHD.  To date, we have not submitted any drug applications to the FDA and do not have anything pending for approval with the FDA. Cell Source itself has not had any contact with any regulator anywhere regarding treatment approvals or clinical trials associated with regulatory approvals. We are aware that the aforementioned hospital in Italy has independently requested approval to conduct a trial with the same protocol that we plan to use, but we are not mentioned in the application, nor in the approval. However, we may indirectly benefit from the outcome of the trial, if successful, although we are not the sponsor of this trial. There are no written or verbal agreements between the hospital and Cell Source regarding the use of the technology. That said, Cell Source is aware and in favor of the hospital plans to use the technology and would find a positive initial outcome encouraging. Since the treatment is being done on compassionate grounds as a non-commercial clinical trial, there is no legal requirement for the hospital to obtain approval to use the treatment protocol.
 
For the Veto Cell application for reducing rejection in Bone Marrow Transplants, Cell Source expects to commence Phase I/II human clinical trials in the US starting sometime in 2018 and in Europe starting in 2019.  Cell Source anticipates that Phase I/II studies will last until 2020 or 2021. These would be followed by completion of Phase II and Phase III, which would last another 2-3 years each, so that full approval, if successful, would be expected sometime in 2026. In Germany there is a possibility of approval for commercial use on a “compassionate grounds” basis at the end of Phase II, which could take place by 2024. In the US, Cell Source plans to commence the IND approval process with the FDA in 2018, which could last until between 2022 and 2025. Cell Source has also entered into a collaboration with Professor Zelig Eshhar, the inventor of CAR-T cell therapy, with respect to combining CAR-T cell therapy with Veto Cell therapy and commenced a pre-clinical proof of concept trial in early 2018. If successful, this could lead to a commencement of a combined FDA trial in 2019 or 2020 and could last until 2026 or 2027.
 
It is possible that Cell Source treatments could qualify for any or all of Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval, RMAT or Priority Review designation under the FDA, which would hasten their approval if successful.
 
The costs for each step of development, in terms of clinical trials, are delineated below:
 
Cell Source estimates the cost of clinical trials alone to be up to $5 million over the coming two years and another $25-50 million in order to reach commercialization for the Veto Cell products. This would mean that Cell Source will need to secure one or more significant capital infusions in order to reach the point that meaningful revenues could be generated.
 
The following table summarizes the development plan through 2024:
 

Competition
 
The development and commercialization of new cell therapies is highly competitive. Our products are focused on treatment of blood cancers, non-malignant blood disorders and organ transplantations. Various products are currently marketed for the treatment of blood cancers. A number of companies are also developing new treatments. In addition to competition from a variety of other nascent unconventional medical treatments, we also face competition from established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions worldwide. For instance, our competitors include the technology developed by Kiadis Pharma, MolMed and Bellicum Pharmaceuticals for facilitating haploidentical HSCT with reduced incidence of GVHD.  All three of these are using high intensity conditioning and are therefore less safe than the reduced intensity conditioning Cell Source plans to provide, and also all are still showing, while reduced, marked incidence of both acute and chronic GVHD, whereas Cell Source plans to virtually eliminate GVHD for HSCT patients.  A number of companies are developing alternative approaches for addressing allogeneic BMT including umbilical cord blood solutions (e.g. Gamida Cell), treatment of post-transplant GVHD (e.g. Mesoblast).  Cell Source believes that its all-in-one solution for addressing engraftment, GVHD and viruses as well as inbuilt additional anti-tumor effect will provide, once successful in trials, an attractive alternative for physicians as the safety associated with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen combined with the compound benefits addressing major HSCT patient issues can provide a compelling treatment approach for a broad set of patients who require allogeneic HSCT.
 

 23
 
In the area of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) technology, both Novartis and Kite Pharma (now part of Gilead Sciences), have received FDA approval for their lead treatment candidates.  JUNO Therapeutics (now part of Celgene) Inc. and Bluebird Bio (in collaboration with Celgene) are currently in human trials for Car-T cell therapy. The success of their patient treatments to date has chiefly been confined to treatment hematological malignancies using he patent’s own cells. This autologous treatment approach brings with it both high costs (Novartis’ Kymriah at $475,000 per treatment; Gilead (KITE) Yescarta at $373,000 per treatment) as well as quality and safety issues. While some companies (e.g. Cellectis – in partnership with Servier and Pfizer) have presented allogeneic CAR-T data, there has been very limited success in this area thus far. A number of companies, including Celyad, Ziopharm, are actively in development of potential off-the-shelf CAR-T cancer therapy solutions. Others are working on TCR, NK and other genetically modified cell structures for allogeneic cancer treatment.
 
Cell Source plans to offer allogenic CAR-T with lower costs and better safety outcomes than the currently approved products, and aspires to compete with product that are currently under development but combining increased persistence with enhanced efficacy using Veto Cell technology to overcome rejection of CAR-T cells and avoid GVHD.
 
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Earlier stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. While our commercial opportunities may be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than our own products, we believe that if our human trials show efficacy at the same levels of our animal trials, we would have the potential to develop at least a niche market share. Also, a number of large US cancer centers such as Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Fred Hutchinson in Seattle, City of Hope in Duarte, California and Dana Farber in Boston are conducting clinical trials and providing treatments on a compassionate care basis that can be funded on a not for profit basis and provide competition to Cell Source.
 
We expect that our ability to compete effectively will depend upon our capacity to:
 
 
· | successfully complete adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that demonstrate statistically significant safety and efficacy and to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals in a timely and cost-effective manner;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | effectively use patents and possibly exclusive partnership agreements with important third party treatment providers and collaborations partners to maintain a stable competitive stance for our Technology; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | attract and retain appropriate clinical and commercial personnel and service providers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | establish adequate distribution relationships for our products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------



Failure in efficiently developing and executing these capabilities may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Strategy Overview
 
Our strategy is based on two underlying drivers: (a) that animal studies show Veto Cell technology to be consistently effective and have advantages over competitors; and (b) that the lead indications (the most common blood cancers) are relatively common, have high mortality and have limited treatment options today.
 
Based on the foregoing drivers, we have developed a business plan with the objective of obtaining regulatory approvals and subsequently launching product sales with a focus on the United States, Europe and Asia.
 
Key Strategy Elements
 
We are pursuing a staged entry strategy. The first several years will be narrowly focused, both in terms of market segments (Blood cancer either directly in combination with CAR-T cell therapy or through bone marrow transplantation) and products (Veto Cell for HSCT and CAR-T + Veto for direct cancer treatment).
 
Subsequently, we plan to broaden the segmentation strategy to include additional bone marrow transplantation indications, major organ transplants combined with HSCT, selected genetic non-malignant diseases and, by combining Veto Cells with CAR-T cell therapy, solid tumor cancers.
 

 24
 
Our strategy can be summarized as follows:
 

Strategy Element | Introductory period (years 1 -3 post FDA approval) | Years 4+ 
---------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Market Segments | · Lymphoma and Leukemia · Solid tumors e.g. breast cancer. | · Same as before plus broader set of solid tumor targets, kidney and liver failure, sickle cell anemia beta thalassemia and other non-malignant hematological disorders; 
Product Rollout | · Veto Cell therapy for B-cell malignancies · Veto+CAR-T Veto Cell therapy for both blood cell and solid tumor cancers | · Veto Cell tolerizing treatment for HSCT and organ transplantation · Veto Cell therapy for cancer and non-malignant disorders; 
Customer/ Geographic Focus | · North America · Western Europe · China | · North America, Western & Eastern Europe, Australia/New Zealand, Russia, Brazil, selected Asian markets 
Channels/Go to Market | · Direct relationships with leading transplantation centers · International production and distribution through partners | · Partnership with global market leaders 
Pricing | · Consistent with other cell therapy offerings currently associated with transplantations and immuno-oncology | · Potentially higher volume, lower cost for “off the shelf” offerings 
Operations | · Three production centers: - US - Western Europe - Far East · Initial capacity leased from major transplantation centers. | · Regional production centers owned or JV with partners 

Segment Selection
 
Within the general market for immune therapies, we have selected target market segments (i.e., medical conditions) for initial focus based on two (2) key criteria:
 
 
1) | Severity of unmet medical need: degree of severity of the indication and the effectiveness of existing treatments. These criteria help determine the proper regulatory pathway.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Technology relevance: relative value of the ability to manage immune response to the treatment of a given indication.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We will initially focus on indications that score highly with respect to both criteria (e.g., Multiple Myeloma, AML). These conditions may qualify for Fast Track status with the FDA, and, due to the cost of current treatment alternatives, could potentially support profitable price points for effective new treatments.
 
Product Rollout
 
Cell Source plans to seek approval initially in the US and Europe and, in parallel but with a delayed start, in China and possibly Taiwan. A successful parallel Phase I/II trial in the US and Europe, which could be concluded by 2020, would serve as a strong foundation for trials in other countries. Limited sales on a “compassionate grounds” basis may commence as early as 2022 in Europe and Asia, and, depending on qualification for Breakthrough Therapy or other Accelerated Approval designation, may be available in the U.S. by 2024. Full approval by the FDA in the U.S. can take as long as 8 years, or 2026.
 

 25
 
Future products may include Veto Cell tolerance inducement therapy for allogeneic bone marrow transplantations and Veto + CAR-T cell therapy for lymphoma, leukemia and solid tumor cancers.
 
Following the initial market penetration and establishment of solid market positioning, we plan to broaden the product offering to address a wider variety of indications which may include custom Veto Cell developments for specific collaborations with other cell therapy treatments. For example, we believe that one area in which we could broaden our product offerings is to utilize our Veto Cell technology, if successful in humans, to address the rejection problems being faced by companies developing NK, TCR and similar cell therapy products, as an enabler for these treatments to help them overcome some of the rejection and persistence related performance issues their technology currently seems to be facing. If our Veto Cell technology proves to be successful in humans, we plan to continue to explore such potential applications in the future.
 
Customer/Geographic Focus
 
Assuming positive clinical trials, we will initially focus our sales efforts of Veto Cell anti-rejection therapy on centers dealing with late stage B-cell malignancies.  High profile, high volume HSCT facilities can be targeted to market this treatment.
 
Current plans are to introduce the products first in North America and Western Europe, and, perhaps concurrently, in China. Focusing on key transplantation facilities in target geographic markets will allow us to both refine the administration of our products and bolster our reputation in respective markets.
 
After the introductory period, we plan to expand its activities in our initial markets while simultaneously broadening geographic coverage. In Stage 2, we plan to initiate active marketing efforts in the remaining Western European countries, Japan, Australia, Eastern Europe, Russia and Brazil.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
The initial target market is concentrated and networked. It comprises the approximately 40 leading transplantation centers in the target geographies. As discussed in the “Market Access” and “Channels” section, these centers are well connected to each other and tend to quickly share innovations and best practices.
 
The planned penetration strategy is to introduce Veto Cell into the best-known and most influential centers in North America and Western Europe, and benefit from the exposure and industry leadership provided by these centers.
 
This initial penetration strategy includes incorporating these centers into the clinical trials so as to expose and involve their medical leadership.
 
In the longer term, we plan to drive use and awareness within and across the broader oncology community in order to encourage oncologists to refer their patients to centers that already use our products and therapies and to encourage pull-influence on additional centers to adopt our products and therapies.
 
The broader provider community will be addressed by attending conventions where research and best clinical practices are shared, seminars are conducted, and networking opportunities are provided for the physicians.
 
Operating Strategy
 
Veto Cell doses are to be prepared by Cell Source facilities or qualified production partners. This is to both protect trade-secrets and directly control quality during the initial stages.
 

 26
 


The graphic below outlines the general operating model in each geographic market.
 

Patient care facilities send frozen cells to a Cell Source processing center. Most likely, the first processing center will consist of lab space leased from or adjacent to a large transplantation center. Such a transplantation center has appropriate equipment and infrastructure, along with available production capacity, and will also represent an immediate market for our offerings for use in their own procedures. The Cell Source processing center processes the cells and sends the treated cells and appropriate protocols back to the caregiver for infusion at time of transplantation.
 
In the introductory period, we plan on establishing one center in the U.S., one in Western Europe (most likely Germany), and one in the Far East. Specific locations and timing are to be determined. Initially, we plan to outsource production capacity from existing facilities operated by Contract Manufacturing Organizations adjacent to large hospitals, or, where capacity is available, contract directly with major cancer treatment centers who have accredited GMP facilities and experienced cell production staff for Veto Cell production. Subsequently, sales from these centers can justify and fund stand-alone facilities.
 
The general goal of the initial centers is to support the FDA process, provide full coverage for the North American and European markets, and provide access to the Chinese market. Following the introductory period in each respective market, we may elect to migrate the production facilities from leased space in transplantation center laboratories to company-owned stand-alone facilities.
 
In general, we assume a capital cost per stand-alone production facility of $8 million. This estimate is based, in part, on the projected high costs of GMP “clean rooms,” each of which can cost $1 million to set up. We will need to obtain financing in order to fund the setup of such facilities. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
 
Clinical Trials Overview
 
We will initially focus our clinical trials on bone marrow transplantation for patients suffering from certain lymphomas and leukemias, for which our Veto Cell technology constitutes a potential breakthrough. These two indications have unmet needs as evidenced by the valuations of leading CAR-T players who thus far have chiefly presented data treating these diseases.
 
We aspire to initiate a company-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trials by the end of 2018. These trials combine traditional Phase 1 safety trials with Phase 2 efficacy trials inasmuch as they are safety trials conducted on sick patients, so they are able to both establish safety and show initial indications of efficacy concurrently. The goal is to demonstrate safety and initial efficacy in several indications. Management has structured the trials such that an additional goal of showing initial markers pointing to prolonging progression-free survival may be possible already within Phase 1/2.
 

 27
 


The chart below provides an overview of the current trials plan, which can of course vary based on both finalization of human protocols and timing or regulatory approvals:
 


Trial Plans
 
Trials are planned for the US and Europe. Multiple trials are planned on at least 24 patients. Patients are expected to be age 50 and older. The conditions chosen are ones which are associated with high mortality in this patient age-group today. This means that we may obtain a limited scope of patient reimbursement from government insurance in Europe on compassionate grounds for the treatment of said age group upon successful completion of Phase 2 trials. We plan to focus on mismatched bone marrow transplantation under reduced intensity conditioning (reduced levels of immune suppression treatment) for B-cell malignancies. We are currently conducting preclinical trials for Veto + CAR-T cell therapy, working with Zelig Eshhar, the inventor of CAR-T technology. Once we complete a proof of concept, we plan to develop our own independent CAR-T cells and launch a clinical trial for blood cell cancer.  Subsequently, we would launch a trial for solid tumor patients.
Regulatory Issues Overview
 
We are seeking regulatory approval from the U.S. FDA, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) in Europe and similar agencies elsewhere to both produce and sell our products.
 
We are targeting approval for the production of Anti-Rejection, Anti-viral Veto Cells in both the United States and Germany by the end of 2018.  We plan to commence human clinical trials for this, our lead product candidate, in the US in 2018 and in Germany in 2019.
 
Regulatory Process and Expectations
 
We have developed and will continue to develop our clinical trial protocols with the support of highly experienced medical practitioners who have vast experience in working with their local regulators.
 
The clinical trials outlined in the previous section are designed to lead to regulatory approval for Veto Cell-based therapy in treating blood cancers and stem cell transplantation applications and, thereafter, solid organ transplantations and solid tumor cancers .
 
Interim Revenue Opportunities
 
While our focus is to conclude Phase 3 approval for cancer treatments, the Company is also exploring complementary shorter term opportunities for generating revenue before additional FDA approvals are received, namely:

1) | Treating patients after the end of Phase 2 (with either partial or full insurance reimbursement available); and
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Potential upfront and milestone driven licensing revenues from collaborations with third parties.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property
 
Pursuant to the Yeda License Agreement, Yeda granted the Company an exclusive license to certain patents, discoveries, inventions and other intellectual property generated (together with others) by Professor Yair Reisner at the  Immunology Department at the Weizmann Institute. Under the Yeda License Agreement, The Company grants Yeda a 4% royalty on sales of patented products. Currently, the Company voluntarily funds research (on its own behalf) at the Weizmann Institute for the preclinical development of its products, and plans to do so through June 2019.  Should the Company elect to curtail such funding, it would have to pay a $50,000 annual license fee until such times as payment of royalties commences. The Yeda License Agreement also requires the Company to proceed with the development of the technologies on a timely basis.
 
 28
 

The license period (per product, per country) is for the full life of the patents, and expires at the later of the patent expiration date in that country or 15 years after the date that the FDA or local equivalent regulatory authority in each country approves that particular product for sale in that country. As long as Cell Source sponsors research or pays either a nominal license fee of $50,000 per year (total for use of all the products) or pays royalties on product sales on at least one product as per the license agreement, the license will remain in effect continuously and expire only with the expiration of the patent or 15 years after regulatory approval (later of the two) per product per country as described above. Cell Source voluntarily sponsors Research at the Weizmann Institute for the sake of developing its products and treatments from initial invention through to finalization of human treatment protocols. Cell Source has recently extended the research period, which was scheduled to have been terminated in October of 2018, through June of 2019.
 
Also under the Yeda License Agreement, the Company agreed to fund Yeda’s research until October 3, 2018, with an aggregate annual payment of $800,000 paid in quarterly $200,000 installments.  In March 2018, the License Agreement was amended to reduce the Company’s funding obligation for the period from October 2017 through September 2018 to $500,000 and $100,000 for the period from October 2018 through June 2019. In addition, the License Agreement was amended to provide that the Company will fund an additional $100,000 of research during 2018 and the Company’s obligation to fund the original research was reduced by $50,000.  The Company funded the additional $100,000 of additional research in April 2018 and $50,000 is being credited against the amount that would otherwise be funded by the Company for the period from July 2018 through September 2018. After giving effect to these amendments and this credit, the Company is required to fund $100,000 for the three month period ending June 30, 2018, $50,000 for the three month period ending December 2018, $25,000 for the three month period ending March 2019 and $25,000 for the three month period ending June 2019.
 
If the Company fails to achieve any one of the milestones set forth in the Yeda License Agreement (as per the current amended version) which are listed below, then Yeda will be entitled to (i) modify the related license such that it will become non-exclusive or (ii) terminate the Yeda License Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice:
 
 
a. | by January 1, 2022, to have commenced Phase II clinical trials in a respect of a Product;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b. | by January 1, 2025, to have either ommnenced Phase III clinical trials or to have received FDA or EMA marketing approval in a respect of a Product (“Marketing Approval”);
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c. | within 12 (twelve) months from the date of Marketing Approval, to have made a First Commercial Sale of a Product; or
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


d. | in case commercial sale of any Product having commenced, there shall be a period of 12 (twelve) months or more during which no sales of any Product shall take place by the Company or its Sublicensees (except as a result of force majeure or other factors beyond the control of the Company)."
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Additionally, the Yeda License Agreement also provides that:
 

 
· | Title. All right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Information and the Patents (as those terms are defined in the Yeda License Agreement) and all right, title and interest in and to any drawings, plans, diagrams, specifications, other documents, models, or any other physical matter in any way containing, representing or embodying any of the foregoing, vest and shall vest in Yeda and subject to the license granted in the Yeda License Agreement.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Patents. Both Yeda and the Company shall consult with one another on the filing of patent applications for any portion of Licensed Information and/or corresponding to patent application existing at the time the Yeda License Agreement was executed. Yeda shall retain outside patent counsel that will be approved by Cell Source, to prepare, file and prosecute patent applications. All applications will be filed in Yeda’s name.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Patents; Patent Infringements. Where the Company determines that a third party is infringing one or more of the Patents or is sued, in prosecuting or defending such litigation, the Company must pay any expenses or costs or other liabilities incurred in connection with such litigation (including attorney’s fees, costs and other sums awarded to the counterparty in such action). The Company agreed to indemnify Yeda against any such expenses or costs or other liabilities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | License. With regard to the expiration of Patents, a Product is deemed to be covered by a Patent so long as such Product is protected by “Orphan Drug” status (or the like). The Company has an exclusive worldwide license under the Licensed Information and the Patents for the development, manufacture and sales of the Products. License remains in force in each country with respect to each Product until the later of (i) the expiration of the last Patent in such country covering such Product or (ii) the expiration of a 15-year period commencing the day FDA New Drug Approval is received for a Product in such country.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our technology portfolio includes a patented platform termed “Veto Cell” (more formally described as “Anti 3rd party central memory T cell”), which is an immune tolerance biotechnology that enables the selective blocking of immune responses.  For a list of all the patents and pending patents that Yeda holds and which we have a license to use, please refer to the table in the section entitled “Science and Technology Overview” above.
 
Patents & Proprietary Rights
 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to protect our existing product candidates and the products we acquire or license by obtaining and maintaining a strong proprietary position. To develop and maintain our position, we intend to continue relying upon patent protection, orphan drug status, Hatch-Waxman exclusivity, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities. We intend to seek patent protection whenever available for any products or product candidates and related technology we acquire in the future.
 
We may also seek orphan drug status whenever it is available. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, meaning that the applicable regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for a period of seven years in the U.S. and Canada, and 10 years in the EU. Orphan drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for the same indication or the same drug for a different clinical indication.
 
It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and may not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual shall be our exclusive property.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
We have not submitted any drug applications to the FDA and do not have anything pending for approval with the FDA. Cell Source itself has not had any contact with any regulator anywhere regarding treatment approvals or clinical trials associated with regulatory approvals. We are aware that a hospital in Italy has independently requested and received approval to conduct a trial with the same protocol that we plan to use, but we are not mentioned in the application nor in the approval. However, we may indirectly benefit from the outcome of the trial, if successful, although we are not the sponsor of this trial. There are no written or verbal agreements between the hospital and Cell Source regarding the use of the technology. That said, Cell Source is aware and in favor of the hospital plans to use the technology and would find a positive initial outcome encouraging. Since the treatment is being done on compassionate grounds as a non-commercial clinical trial, there is no legal requirement for the hospital to obtain approval to use the treatment protocol.

Cell Source plans to apply for approval for human clinical trials in 2018 to show initial safety, and possibly efficacy, results in Europe and the US. As of the date of this filing, the Company has had no contact with any regulator regarding such approvals.
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant factor, affecting the cost and time of our research and product development activities, and will be a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of any approved products. All of our products require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, our products are subject to rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing and other approval requirements by the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries. Various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing, safety, reporting, labeling, transport and storage, record keeping and marketing of our products. The lengthy process of seeking these approvals, and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, the necessary regulatory approvals could harm our business.
 
The regulatory requirements relating to the testing, manufacturing and marketing of our products may change from time to time and this may impact our ability to conduct clinical trials and the ability of independent investigators to conduct their own research with support from us.
 
The clinical development, manufacturing and marketing of our products are subject to regulation by various authorities in the U.S., the EU and other countries, including, in the U.S., the FDA, in Canada, Health Canada, and, in the EU, the EMEA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act in the U.S. and numerous directives, regulations, local laws and guidelines in Canada and the EU and elsewhere govern the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. Product development and approval within these regulatory frameworks takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources.
 
Regulatory approval will be required in all the major markets in which we seek to develop our products. At a minimum, approval requires the generation and evaluation of data relating to the quality, safety, and efficacy of an investigational product for its proposed use. The specific types of data required and the regulations relating to this data will differ depending on the territory, the treatment candidate involved, the proposed indication and the stage of development.
 
In general, new cell compositions are tested in animals until adequate evidence of safety is established to support the proposed clinical study protocol designs. Clinical trials for new products are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. In Phase I, the initial introduction of the pharmaceutical into either healthy human volunteers or patients with the disease (typically 20 to 50 subjects), the emphasis is on testing for safety (adverse effects), dosage tolerance, metabolism, distribution, excretion and clinical pharmacology. Phase II involves studies in a limited patient population (typically 50 to 200 patients) to determine the initial efficacy of the pharmaceutical for specific targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Once a treatment protocol shows preliminary evidence of some efficacy and is found to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase II evaluations, Phase III trials are undertaken to more fully evaluate clinical outcomes in a larger patient population in adequate and well-controlled studies designed to yield statistically sufficient clinical data to demonstrate efficacy and safety.
 
In the U.S., specific pre-clinical data, manufacturing and chemical data, as described above, need to be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application, which, unless the FDA objects, will become effective thirty (30) days following receipt by the FDA. Phase I studies in human volunteers may commence only after the application becomes effective. Prior regulatory approval for human healthy volunteer studies is also required in member states of the EU. Currently, in each member state of the EU, following successful completion of Phase I studies, data are submitted in summarized format to the applicable regulatory authority in the member state in respect of applications for the conduct of later Phase II studies. In many places in Europe, a two tiered approval system mandates approval at the regional level prior to applying for national approval. Regional approval cycle times, including multiple iterations where questions are answered and the specific details of the protocol may be fine-tuned, can last several months prior to applying to the national (federal government level) regulator. The national regulatory authorities in the EU typically have between one and three months in which to raise any objections to the proposed study, and they often have the right to extend this review period at their discretion. In the U.S., following completion of Phase I studies, further submissions to regulatory authorities are necessary in relation to Phase II and III studies to update the existing IND. Authorities may require additional data before allowing the studies to commence and could demand that the studies be discontinued at any time if there are significant safety issues. In addition to the regulatory review, a study involving human subjects has to be approved by an independent body. The exact composition and responsibilities of this body will differ from country to country. In the U.S., for example, each study will be conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board at each institution at which the study is conducted. This board considers among other things, the design of the study, ethical factors, the privacy of protected health information as defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the safety of the human subjects and the possible liability risk for the institution. Equivalent rules to protect subjects’ rights and welfare apply in each member state of the EU, where one or more independent ethics committees, which typically operate similarly to an institutional review board, will review the ethics of conducting the proposed research. These ethical review committees typically exist at the regional level, where approval is required prior to applying for national approval. Other regulatory authorities around the rest of the world have slightly differing requirements involving both the execution of clinical trials and the import/export of pharmaceutical products. It is our responsibility to ensure we conduct our business in accordance with the regulations of each relevant territory.

By leveraging existing pre-clinical and clinical data, we are seeking build upon an existing pre-clinical safety and efficacy database to accelerate our research. In addition, our focus on an end-stage population which has no current treatment options, commercialization, may result in relatively shorter approval cycle times. Approval by the FDA in this category generally has been based on objective response rates and duration of responses rather than demonstration of survival benefit. As a result, trials of drugs to treat end-stage refractory cancer indications have historically involved fewer patients and generally have been faster to complete than trials of drugs for other indications. We are aware that the FDA and other similar agencies are regularly reviewing the use of objective endpoints for commercial approval and that policy changes may impact the size of trials required for approval, timelines and expenditures significantly. The trend over the past few years has been to shorten approval cycles for terminal patients in the U.S. by employing a “fast track” approach.
 
In order to gain marketing approval, we must submit a dossier to the relevant authority for review, which is known in the U.S. as an NDA and in the EU as a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The format is usually specific and laid out by each authority, although in general it will include information on the quality of the chemistry, manufacturing and pharmaceutical aspects of the product as well as the non-clinical and clinical data. Once the submitted NDA is accepted for filing by the FDA, it undertakes the review process that takes ten (10) months, unless an expedited priority review is granted which takes six (6) months to complete. Approval can take several months to several years, if multiple ten (10) month review cycles are needed before final approval is obtained, if at all.
 
The approval process can be affected by a number of factors. The NDA may be approvable requiring additional pre-clinical, manufacturing data or clinical trials which may be requested at the end of the ten (10) month NDA review cycle, thereby delaying marketing approval until the additional data are submitted and may involve substantial unbudgeted costs. The regulatory authorities usually will conduct an inspection of relevant manufacturing facilities, and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. In addition to obtaining approval for each product, in many cases each drug manufacturing facility must be approved. Further inspections may occur over the life of the product. An inspection of the clinical investigation sites by a competent authority may be required as part of the regulatory approval procedure. As a condition of marketing approval, the regulatory agency may require post-marketing surveillance to monitor for adverse effects or other additional studies as deemed appropriate. After approval for the initial indication, further clinical studies are usually necessary to gain approval for any additional indications. The terms of any approval, including labeling content, may be more restrictive than expected and could affect the marketability of a product.
 
The FDA offers a number of regulatory mechanisms that provide expedited or accelerated approval procedures for selected drugs in the indications on which we are focusing our efforts. These include accelerated approval under Subpart H of the agency’s NDA approval regulations, fast track drug development procedures and priority review. At this time, we have not determined whether any of these approval procedures will apply to any of our current treatment candidates.
 
The U.S., E.U. and other jurisdictions may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which, in the U.S., is generally a disease or condition that affects no more than 200,000 individuals. In the E.U., orphan drug designation can be granted if: the disease is life threatening or chronically debilitating and affects no more than fifty (50) in 100,000 persons in the E.U.; without incentive it is unlikely that the drug would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment; and no satisfactory method of treatment for the condition exists or, if it does, the new drug will provide a significant benefit to those affected by the condition. If a product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, meaning that the applicable regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for a period of seven years in the U.S. and ten (10) years in the EU. Orphan drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for the same indication or the same drug for different indications. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or MAA. After orphan drug designation is granted, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are publicly disclosed. Orphan drug designation does not convey an advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the review and approval process; however, this designation provides an exemption from marketing authorization (NDA) fees.
 
We are also subject to numerous environmental and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the use and disposal of hazardous materials. The cost of compliance with and any violation of these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, accidental contamination or injury from these materials may occur. Compliance with laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or our competitive position. However, we are not able to predict the extent of government regulation, and the cost and effect thereof on our competitive position, which might result from any legislative or administrative action pertaining to environmental or safety matters.
 
In various countries, animal rights activism has led to either formal or informal boycotting of certain types of animal trials. As we rely on animal experiments as precursors to human trials.

Employees
 
Other than our Chief Executive Officer, we currently do not have full-time employees, but retain the services of independent contractors/consultants on a contract-employment basis. Our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our management systems and to recruit and train new employees. Although we have done so in the past and expect to do so in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel. We anticipate that in the near future, other key personnel will enter into employment agreements with the Company on customary terms.
