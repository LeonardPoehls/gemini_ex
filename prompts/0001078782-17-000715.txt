Business Strategy Overview and Products 

APT Systems, Inc. (APT Systems, the Company, We or Us) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 29, 2010 (Inception) to operate as a Fintech Company and engage in the creation of innovative and intuitive stock trading platforms, financial apps and new visualization solutions for charting the financial markets. While management works to deliver mobile equities trading platform and charting software, it also is strategically acquiring other compatible software or financial businesses which demonstrate strong growth potential stemming from a solid business plan. We have identified prospective opportunities such as our acquisition of Global Trader software and continue with our due diligence efforts that will and do include testing software performance within funded external trading accounts. Over the year, the Company has continued to claim income earned from its testing of strategies and trading software as other income. The testing continues to generate positive returns. Small revenue continues to come from the Apple store from a previously launched publication promoting a trading strategy that is successfully testing Apple revenue payment delivery.

Management will continue to expand upon trading its platform named Intuitrader and related software products, being those recently acquired predictive indicators called Global Trader as well as those developed in-house such as kenCharts. Any profits generated from funds used in live trading tests can be used to offset future development costs, for which there is a plan to operate from within a wholly-owned subsidiary. We constantly strive to pioneer original trading tools and indicators along with new approaches for managing trading risk. After beta testing is completed, our proprietary custom charting tools and trading platform apps will later be available to subscribers for a fee.

The Company has not as yet generated significant product sales revenues as its key products are still under development. Further product advancements will be commenced upon securing necessary funding. Our limited start-up operations have consisted of development of a business plan, identification of our target market and limited research towards the development of its software architecture. The Company has launched a publication using its Apple developer account to test revenue deliveries and has been concentrating on improving its intellectual property for charting applications. 
 
We obtained approval of our symbol APTY for electronic trading in November 2015, and we plan on raising additional funds by issuing shares of our common and preferred stock. We accepted loans this year and successfully completed a private placement in the following quarter ending April 30, 2017 but we do not rule out the possibility of taking out additional loans. On May 6, 2016 we filed an S-1 to support an equity line funding but circumstances were that we could not further the application and ended the agreements in November, 2016. Our lawyer formally advised the SEC by written letter of these circumstances and no further action on the file is required at this time. There is no guarantee we will be successful in further raising funds sufficient to progress with the full implementation of our business plan. We have not been subject to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.

In order to advance itself, APT Systems can also roll out technical trading tools and publish kenCharts for the hand held market to test its business plans and generate cash flow. We are focusing our early attention on the charting software we own and rewriting the code to provide a native chart only app for both Android and iOS platforms. This charting tool and the charts that it produces can be configured to the users preferred view such as a line chart or candlestick chart, and the user shall be able to adjust the chart intervals as the user desires. We plan to utilize delayed time initially and later real time data networks along with graphic techniques which will provide solutions that can speak to the mobile needs to be demanded by the next generation of equity and commodity traders. However, these tools would be invigorated with leading edge graphics and networking technology to become desirable real-time and interactive trading assistance software.

As a Fintech company, APT services and products can later extend to include:

·
 Financial Software and Analytical Software Development
 ·
 Algorithmic Applied Technology
 ·
 Trading Platform Refinement and Linking to Brokerage Accounts
 ·
 Analytical Charting Software Development
 ·
 Explore plans for upcoming proposed National Banking Charters for Fintech companies

The steps remaining for us to begin selling our products listed above are to finalize the programming and rewriting of the software used in our products, specifically our dimensional charting tools, begin sales and marketing campaigns, contact prospective licensees, and deliver our products, which we expect to complete in less than 180 days after our initial contact with prospective licensees. Our app would be available to users on a subscription fee plan and we plan to grant licenses in our app to financial companies and brokerage firms for use by their employees and clients. The goal is to have our product used by both handheld (tablet and Smartphone application users) and web based clients.

Our mailing address is in an executive suite facility at 505 Montgomery Street, 11th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94111 which also provides office services, computer access and meeting space on demand. We consider this current executive office space arrangement adequate for our current operations and will reassess our needs annually based upon the future growth of the Company. Our fiscal year end is January 31st.

Needs Assessment
 
Management believes the principal growth area in the personal computer market today is that of Smartphones and portable tablet devices. These mobile devices usually allow full time internet connectivity which makes them an ideal stage for a mobile equity-trading platform and charting tool. Instead of merely importing existing software to allow on-the-go research and trading, we envision for our future products an information-dense and interactive display of the financial markets. At this time, we believe that the future interactive display will include three dimensional imaging that we intend to use to provide information in new ways that can better assist novice users learning about publicly traded companies and those users who are trading equities in the public markets.
 
Distribution methods of the products or services 
 
To facilitate marketing plans, our products and platforms will be available initially in the App Store managed by Apple Inc. Later, these same products will be available to audiences that prefer using other Smartphones such as Googles Android and other platforms. Especially in the case of Apple, these companies will provide marketing infrastructure to help developers reach their users and justify costs charged related to selling products from their app stores. All new marketing options within North America will be fully explored and implemented as it makes sense to do so. We plan to launch beta testing campaigns as well to attract prospective subscribers and garner suggestions for improvements.

Organization
 
We are comprised of one corporation and do not have any subsidiaries but do not rule out the future possibility of acquiring or creating subsidiaries. At this time, all of our operations are conducted through this corporation but we are actively researching the requirements and impact of opening a subsidiary office in Nevada.

Competition
 
The market for financial services software and services is competitive, rapidly evolving and highly sensitive to new product introductions and marketing efforts by industry participants, although high conversion costs can create barriers to adoption of new products or technologies. The market is fragmented by the different offers and served by both large-scale firms as well as firms that target only local markets or specific types of clients such as the millennial crowd. We also face 
competition from information systems developed and serviced internally by the IT departments of large financial services firms. We believe that we can compete effectively by providing software contained in a mobile application, which provides proprietary buy/sell suggestions, and a platform to enhance trading ability of users, although some of our existing competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, distribution and marketing resources than we have currently and may offer products with different functions or features that are more attractive to potential customers than our offerings. 

Moreover, it is not our intent to compete with larger financial services firms, but rather to facilitate more trades by better informing our joint clients and providing them with better trading tools. The trading tools such as dimensional charts may be licensed to these same banks and brokers or subscribed to by users, directly in apps. We are broker agnostic and believe that we can work with the banks and brokerage firms who offer online and Smartphone trading access by providing them with the opportunity to generate additional commissions from their existing client base.
 
Contracted Consultants

Our directors currently provide their time and undertake duties as directors without compensation for these services. At the time the Company derives sufficient cash flow from operations or financing, the Company will evaluate the ability to compensate our directors.

Effective November 1, 2013, the Company began to accrue a monthly salary of $5,000 per month for the President on an ongoing basis. Accrued officer compensation as of January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016 was $170,300 and $125,300, respectively. As resolved earlier, the accrued compensation for quarter ending October 31, 2016 will only be paid out after January 1, 2018 as and when the directors decide the Company has sufficient liquidity to pay some, or all, of the amounts accrued in cash or by issuing shares. The President of the Company can also consider submitting a request to the Board of Directors for permission to convert some, or all, of her accrued compensation into shares of the Companys common stock on payments due above of $170,300, but only after January 1, 2018. The share price considerations will be either the publicly quoted share price, when such a publicly quoted price is available; or equal to or above the last cash price the Company recorded for the sale of its common shares to third parties. The President elected to take 15,000,000 restricted common shares against accruals.

Intellectual Property Information
 
Our success and ability to compete will be dependent to a significant degree on our 
intellectual property, which may include our trade name, trading models, and visual chart styling. We intend to develop our technology internally and further acquire software. We will rely primarily on trade secret, trademark, copyright, domain name, patent and contract law to protect our 
intellectual property. It is our intention to enter into confidentiality, 
intellectual property invention assignment and/or non-competition and non-solicitation agreements or restrictions with our employees, independent contractors and business partners, and to control access to and distribution of our 
intellectual property. Currently, we do not have any registered copyrights or patents; however, we may obtain such registrations in the future. 

Government Regulation
 
We do not expect to be subject to material governmental regulation. However, it is our policy to fully comply with all governmental regulation and regulatory authorities.
Research and Development
 
We have incurred minimal cost in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, on research and development of our website and mobile applications that was included as part of consulting services incurred to date. We plan to spend further funds on research and development activities in the future as the development of our software applications continue if we are able to raise the necessary funding. 
Environmental Compliance
 
We believe that we are not subject to any material costs for compliance with any environmental laws.
