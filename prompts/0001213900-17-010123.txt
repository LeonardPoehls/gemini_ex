Corporate History
 
We were incorporated on December 22, 2008 under the laws of the State of Nevada.  We were formerly known as Trade Link. On April 4, 2011, the Board of Directors of Trade Link filed an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation with the State of Nevada and changed our name from Trade Link to China Modern Agricultural Information, Inc.  
 
On January 28, 2011, we entered into a share exchange agreement by and among (i) Value Development Holding Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (“Value Development”), (ii) Value Development’s shareholders, (iii) us, and (iv) our former principal stockholders.    Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Value Development’s shareholders transferred to us all of the shares of Value Development in exchange for the issuance of 35,998,000 shares of our common stock. The shares issued to Value Development’s shareholders in the Securities Exchange constituted approximately 87.80% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of and immediately after the consummation of the Securities Exchange. As a result of the Securities Exchange, Value Development became our wholly owned subsidiary and Value Development’s former principal shareholders became our principal shareholders.  
 
On January 28, 2011, Value Development completed the acquisition of Jiasheng Consulting Managerial Co., Ltd., a PRC company (“Jiasheng Consulting”).  Jiasheng Consulting entered into a series of contractual agreements with Heilongjiang Zhongxian Information Co., Ltd., a PRC company (“Zhongxian Information”), Mr. Zhengxin Liu, our Chief Human Resource Officer and holder of 62% the of equity interest in Zhongxian Information, and Mr. Youliang Wang, our Chief Executive Officer and holder of 38% of the equity interest of Zhongxian Information. Pursuant to the contractual arrangements, Jiasheng Consulting controls all managerial power of Zhongxian Information.    The contractual arrangements include a shareholder voting rights proxy agreement, exclusive consulting and services agreement, exclusive call option agreement and equity pledge agreement, pursuant to which, Jiasheng Consulting shall provide exclusive and complete business support and technical and consulting service to Zhongxian Information in exchange for an annual fee in the amount of Zhongxian Information’s yearly net profits after tax, and Zhongxian Information’s stockholders pledged their rights, title and equity interest in Zhongxian Information as security for the collection of such consulting and service fees provided in the equity pledge agreement. 
 
Zhongxian Information was incorporated in China in January 2005 with registered capital of RMB 10,000,000 or $1,206,800 US Dollars.  In February 2006, it acquired 99% of the registered capital of Heilongjiang Xinhua Cattle Industry Co., Ltd., a PRC company (“Xinhua Cattle”), which was incorporated in China in December 2005 with registered capital of RMB 3,000,000 or $371,580 US Dollars. Xinhua Cattle is located in Qiqihar, Heilongjiang Province, in northeast China and is a livestock company that engages in cow breeding and fresh milk production and distribution.
 
On November 23, 2011, Zhongxian Information acquired 100% of the equity interest of Shangzhi Yulong Cattle Co., Ltd., a PRC company (“Yulong Cattle”), in exchange for (i) issuance of 9,000,000 shares of our common stock, and (ii) a cash payment of $4,396,000, to Yulong Cattle’s former shareholders. Yulong Cattle was incorporated on December 4, 2007 under the laws of the PRC. Yulong Cattle, located in Harbin, Heilongjiang, in northeast China, is a livestock company that engages in cow breeding and fresh milk distribution, and primarily generates its revenue from the sale of fresh milk. 
 
On July 16, 2015, we transferred 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Value Development to China Dairy Corporation Ltd., a Hong Kong company (“China Dairy”), which is 60% owned indirectly by the Company through the Company’s wholly- owned subsidiary, Hope Diary Holdings Ltd., a British Virgin Islands company (“Hope Diary”). These transactions involve no consideration received or paid as Value Development and China Dairy are under common control with us and this transaction is a restriction to our interests in Value Development.

China Dairy was newly incorporated in January 2015 and did not have any significant assets or liabilities, or business operations, which is 100% owned by Company’s PRC corporate advisor. Further, the sole shareholder transferred the 10,000 shares of China Dairy to Value Development 60% and various shareholder and consultants of the Company 40% at HK$1.00 per share. 
 
The 40% of the 10,000 shares of China Dairy were transferred from the sole shareholder of China Dairy to the following entities at HK$1.00 per share, which has direct or indirect relationship with the shareholder and consultants of the Company: 3% to Beijing Ruihua Future, 4% to Donghe Group, 3% to Integral Capital, 20% to Dingxi Shanghai Fund and 10% to Zhiyuan International. Immediately after the transfer, 65,000 bonus shares were issued at no consideration for every existing share. 
 
Value Development is the sole shareholder of Value Development Group Limited, which is the sole shareholder of Harbin Jiasheng Consulting Managerial Co. Ltd. (“Jiasheng Consulting”), which is our subsidiary in China, with respect to which the operating company, Zhongxian Information, is a variable interest entity. The effect of this transaction was to reduce the interest of ours in its operating company by 40%. We use the China Dairy’s offering price for the Proposed Offering to approximate the fair value of the 40% stock granted to the shareholder and consultants. 
 
On September 16, 2015 our 60%-owned subsidiary, Jiasheng Consulting, exercised its option to purchase all of the registered equity of our operating subsidiary, Zhongxian Information from its stockholders Zhengxin Liu and Youliang Wang, who are also the members of our Board of Directors, for RMB10,000 (approximately $1,634). Prior to the acquisition, Jiasheng Consulting controlled Zhongxian Information through a series of contractual agreements, which made Zhongxian Information a variable interest entity, the effect of which was to cause the balance sheet and operating results of Zhongxian Information to be consolidated with those of Jiasheng Consulting in our financial statements. As a result of the acquisition by Jiasheng Consulting of the registered ownership of Zhongxian Information, the balance sheet and operating results of Zhongxian Information hereafter continues to be consolidated with those of Jiasheng Consulting as its 100% owned subsidiary.
 
On April 8, 2016, our 60% owned subsidiary, China Dairy Corporation Limited issued 84,906,541 CDI shares at AUD $0.2 per share on ASX and raised total fund of AUD $16,981,308 (USD $13,021,267). After the IPO, our ownership was diluted to 53.07%.
 
Our current structure is set forth below:

Our Business Model
 
We generate revenues from three sources: sale of fresh milk, processing and sales of organic fertilizer, and assisting local farmers with their fresh milk sale efforts.
Fresh Milk
 
We exclusively use Holstein cows for our milk production. Holstein cows are well-regarded for their abundant milk production and high-quality milk. Our cows currently have an average milking period of 305 days and produce milk that contains approximately 3.5% fat. Each adult cow produces approximate 8,900 kilograms annually. 
 
Our farmland is located in the Heilongjiang province which has a humid continental climate. This climate is ideal for the growth of grass, which in turn is essential in the grazing and feeding of our cattle that aids in our breeding of cows and calves, fresh milk production and organic fertilizer production. We maintain strict quality control and testing procedures to ensure our milk products are of high quality. The milk production and quality controls ensure that the milk produced is high in nutrients and active biological substances.
 
Cow Feeders
 
Xinhua Cattle outsources over 90% of the cow feeding to local farmers pursuant to a series of entrusting feeding agreements with the local farmers. Pursuant to these agreements, we pay for the fostering fees and feed costs. In return, the local farmers provide us with the fresh milk produced by the cows.
 
Pursuant to these entrust feeding agreements, we entrust our cattle to local farmers to assist in a more efficient means to produce fresh milk, as well as manure, used in our production of organic fertilizer. In that regard, we pay a monthly fee to local farmers that correlate to the number of calves, cattle, and cows that are placed in their care. Pursuant to the agreements, local farmers are responsible for the feeding and raising of the cattle as well as the fresh milk production. Additionally, these local farmers ensure that each cow produces a minimum of 20 kilograms of milk daily.
 
Between July and August 2015, monthly feeding fee to the local farmers is $7.77 per baby cow, $10.88 per pre-adult cow, $15.54 per young cow and $31.08 per adult cow, respectively; food costs every month to the local farmers is $51 per baby cow, $65 per pre-adult cow, $71 per young cow, and $106 per adult cow, respectively. Since August 2015, the monthly feeding fee remains the same while between September and November the food costs increased to $61 per baby cow, $76 per pre-adult cow, $85 per young cow, and $127 per adult cow, respectively. From November 2015, the food costs increased further to $70 per baby cow, $85 per pre-adult cow, $101 per young cow, and $233 per adult cow, respectively. The cost remained unchanged since November 2015 and through the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.
 
Local farmers are responsible for milk production and are required to timely deliver the milk production daily. All of the raw milk produced by the cattle is owned by us. Additionally, the local farmers are contractually obligated to conduct periodic breeding for the young cattle and cows, at our expense. The breeding is overseen by veterinarians of our choosing. All calves produced by our entrusted cows are our property, and all calve births are overseen by veterinarians of our choosing. All cow waste produced by our entrusted cattle is owned by us. The local farmers are obligated to collect the waste and provide it to us for further processing, and eventual sale as organic fertilizer.
 
Fresh Milk Customers
 
Mengniu Dairy Co. Ltd.
 
Mengniu Dairy Co. Ltd. (“Mengniu”) has been a purchaser of our raw milk products since 2006. Our contractual arrangement provided for the purchase of our milk at the base price of RMB 3.45 or $0.55/kilogram. However, the base price is based on the quality of our raw milk, namely, fat percentage of 3.1%, protein percentage of 2.95%, and the Level One microorganism quality (less than 0.5 million / ml). We terminated the agreement with Mengniu on August 28, 2017.

Organic Fertilizer
 
As a by-product of the fresh milk production, we use the resulting manure as a source of additional revenue. We combine the raw material, the manure, with inoculating complex microbial agents, and then ferment the product using biological and chemical processes and microbial fermentation technology, which produces the organic fertilizer.
 
Our fertilizer product is unique, in that it decomposes slowly, maintains long fertilizing effect and slow nutrient loss. It can effectively promote the proliferation of useful microorganisms and enhance soil fertility, resulting in more abundant crop growth.
 
Zhongxian Information has formed a livestock business system which integrates fresh milk production and organic fertilizer production for direct sale to suppliers.
 
The sale of organic fertilizer only makes up a very small amount of our total revenue. We generated USD $47,537 in revenue from our organic fertilizer sales in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 and USD $57,459 in revenue from our organic fertilizer sales in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Jianfa Bio-Organic Fertilizer Plant was the sole customer for our organic fertilizer products from 2006 to June 2011. Since July 2011, we have been selling our organic fertilizer products to Heilongjiang Soyang Bio Energy Development Ltd.


Sales Commissions
 
In addition to selling fresh milk to Chinese manufacturing and distribution companies of dairy products, we started to sell our milk cows to local farmers in exchange for monthly payments from the local farmers on their monthly milk sales since June 2011. The monthly payments represent the monthly installments, including interest, for the purchase price of milk cows sold, or a mix of the purchase price and commissions for our assistance in arranging for their milk sales.


In September 2011, August 2011, and June 2011, Xinhua Cattle sold 3,787, 5,635, and 2,000 of its cows to local farmers, respectively. In November and December 2014, Yulong sold 3,714 and 2,995 cows to local farmers respectively. 3,500 of the cows sold in 2014 were purchased from outside unrelated parties for $4,550,000. The remaining cows sold were raised by Yulong. According to the agreements signed with the local farmers in June 2011, the sales price will be collected over five years, with a minimum payment of 20% of the sales price to be paid each year. The related receivable is recorded at its present value at a discount rate of 12%, which is commensurate with interest rates for notes with similar risk. The Company also entered into agreements with these local farmers for a 30% commission of their monthly milk sales generated by the cows sold in exchange for the Company’s assistance in arranging for the sale of the milk. 
 
Pursuant to the agreements signed in August 2011, September 2011, November 2014, and December 2014, the sales price will be collected in monthly installments plus interest at 7% on the outstanding balance, over the remaining useful lives of the cows, which range from one to eight years. Local farmers are required to pay 30% of monthly milk sales generated from the cows purchased by the farmers. The 30% monthly payments are to be applied first to the monthly installment of principal for the cows sold and the balance as commission income for the Company’s assistance in arranging for the sale of the milk. The 30% monthly payments will continue over the entire remaining life of the cows sold. While the 30% rate and the amount applied to monthly installments for the purchase price of the cows remain the same, the amount of sales commission income will vary depending on total monthly milk sales and the progress of repayments towards the purchase price. 
 
Xinhua Cattle sold a total of 6,286 female calves to outside parties at a total price of RMB 27,137,500 (US $3,986,499 in the year ended June 30, 2017. The net value of these female calves was approximately RMB 39,135,557 (US $5,749,000). Xinhua Cattle also sold 473 pre-adult cows at RMB 3,216,400 (US$472,489) with a net value of RMB 9,650,258 (US$ 1,417,600) in the year ended June 30, 2017.

Yulong Cattle sold 1,919 female calves to outside parties at a total price of RMB 8,320,000 (US $1,222,208) in the year ended June 30, 2017. The net value of these female calves was approximately RMB 7,742,000 (US $1,137,000).  
 
By the end of June 30, 2017, we had 31,531 cows, among which, 24,127 cows continue to be fed by local farmers, 2,000 cows are maintained by Xinhua Cattle, and 5,404 cows are maintained by Yulong Cattle.
 
Between July and August 2015, monthly feeding fee to the local farmers is $7.77 per baby cow, $10.88 per pre-adult cow, $15.54 per young cow and $31.08 per adult cow, respectively; food costs every month to the local farmers is $51 per baby cow, $65 per pre-adult cow, $71 per young cow, and $106 per adult cow, respectively. Since August 2015, the monthly feeding fee remains the same while between September and November the food costs increased to $61 per baby cow, $76 per pre-adult cow, $85 per young cow, and $127 per adult cow, respectively. From November 2015, the food costs increased further to $70 per baby cow, $85 per pre-adult cow, $101 per young cow, and $233 per adult cow, respectively. The cost remained unchanged through the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.
 
The increase in feeding costs was the main reason that we disposed of a large number of our cows. The bulk sales of milk cows provide us with a new revenue stream with relatively low direct costs as the local farmers assumed the milk production function.
 
Research and Development
 
We had no expenses on research and development activities during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We regard the protection of our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights as critical to our future success. We rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services. We cannot assure you that these contractual arrangements or the other steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will prove sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or to deter independent third-party development of similar technologies.

China Regulations
 
This section sets forth a summary of the most significant Chinese regulations or requirements that may affect our business activities operated in China or our shareholders’ right to receive dividends and other distributions of profits from the PRC subsidiaries.
Foreign Investment in PRC Operating Companies
 
The Foreign Investment Industrial Catalogue jointly issued by the MOFCOM and the National Development and Reform Commission or the NDRC in 2007 classified various industries/business into three different categories: (i) encouraged for foreign investment; (ii) restricted to foreign investment; and (iii) prohibited from foreign investment. For any industry/business not covered by any of these three categories, they will be deemed industries/business permitted to have foreign investment. Except for those expressly provided restrictions, encouraged and permitted industries/business are usually 100% open to foreign investment and ownership. With regard to those industries/business restricted to or prohibited from foreign investment, there is always a limitation on foreign investment and ownership. The PRC Subsidiary’s business does not fall under the industry categories that are restricted to, or prohibited from foreign investment and is not subject to the limitation on foreign investment and ownership.

Regulation of Foreign Currency Exchange
 
Foreign currency exchange in the PRC is governed by a series of regulations, including the Foreign Currency Administrative Rules (1996), as amended, and the Administrative Regulations Regarding Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996), as amended. Under these regulations, the Renminbi is freely convertible for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for direct investment, loans or investments in securities outside the PRC without the prior approval of SAFE. Pursuant to the Administrative Regulations Regarding Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996), Foreign Invested Enterprises (“FIEs”) may purchase foreign exchange without the approval of SAFE for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions by providing commercial documents evidencing these transactions. They may also retain foreign exchange, subject to a cap approved by SAFE, to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay dividends. However, the relevant Chinese government authorities may limit or eliminate the ability of FIEs to purchase and retain foreign currencies in the future. In addition, foreign exchange transactions for direct investment, loan and investment in securities outside the PRC are still subject to limitations and require approvals from SAFE.
 
Regulation of FIEs’ Dividend Distribution
 
The principal laws and regulations in the PRC governing distribution of dividends by FIEs include:
 

(i) | The Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law (1979), as amended, and the Regulations for the Implementation of the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law (1983), as amended; 
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | The Sino-foreign Cooperative Enterprise Law (1988), as amended, and the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Sino-foreign Cooperative Enterprise Law (1995), as amended; 
(iii) | The Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (1986), as amended, and the Regulations of Implementation of the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (1990), as amended. 

 
Under these regulations, FIEs in the PRC may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC are required to set aside at least 10% of their respective accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds unless such reserve funds have reached 50% of their respective registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. The board of directors of a FIE has the discretion to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation.
 
Regulation of a Foreign Currency’s Conversion into RMB and Investment by FIEs
 
On August 29, 2008, SAFE issued a Notice of the General Affairs Department of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on the Relevant Operating Issues concerning the Improvement of the Administration of Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises or Notice 142, to further regulate the foreign exchange of FIEs. According to the Notice 142, FIEs shall obtain verification report from a local accounting firm before converting its registered capital of foreign currency into Renminbi, and the converted Renminbi shall be used for the business within its permitted business scope. The Notice 142 explicitly prohibits FIEs from using RMB converted from foreign capital to make equity investments in the PRC, unless the domestic equity investment is within the approved business scope of the FIE and has been approved by SAFE in advance.
 
Regulation of Foreign Exchange in Certain Onshore and Offshore Transactions
 
In October 2005, SAFE issued the Notice on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-raising and Return Investment Activities of Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, or SAFE Notice 75, which became effective as of November 1, 2005, and was further supplemented by two implementation notices issued by SAFE on November 24, 2005 and May 29, 2007, respectively. SAFE Notice 75 states that PRC residents, whether natural or legal persons, must register with the relevant local SAFE branch prior to establishing or taking control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas equity financing involving onshore assets or equity interests held by them. The term “PRC legal person residents” as used in SAFE Notice 75 refers to those entities with legal person status or other economic organizations established within the territory of the PRC. The term “PRC natural person residents” as used in SAFE Notice 75 includes all PRC citizens and all other natural persons, including foreigners, who habitually reside in the PRC for economic benefit. SAFE implementation notice of November 24, 2005 further clarifies that the term “PRC natural person residents” as used under SAFE Notice 75 refers to those “PRC natural person residents” defined under the relevant PRC tax laws and those natural persons who hold any interests in domestic entities that are classified as “domestic-funding” interests.

PRC residents are required to complete amended registrations with the local SAFE branch upon (i) injection of equity interests or assets of an onshore enterprise to the offshore entity, or (ii) subsequent overseas equity financing by such offshore entity. PRC residents are also required to complete amended registrations or filing with the local SAFE branch within 30 days of any material change in the shareholding or capital of the offshore entity, such as changes in share capital, share transfers, and long-term equity or debt investments and these changes do not relate to return investment activities. PRC residents who have already organized or gained control of offshore entities that have made onshore investments in the PRC before SAFE Notice 75 was promulgated must register their shareholdings in the offshore entities with the local SAFE branch on or before March 31, 2006.
 
Under SAFE Notice 75, PRC residents are further required to repatriate into the PRC all of their dividends, profits or capital gains obtained from their shareholdings in the offshore entity within 180 days of their receipt of such dividends, profits or capital gains. The registration and filing procedures under SAFE Notice 75 are prerequisites for other approval and registration procedures necessary for capital inflow from the offshore entity, such as inbound investments or shareholders loans, or capital outflow to the offshore entity, such as the payment of profits or dividends, liquidating distributions, equity sale proceeds, or the return of funds upon a capital reduction.
 
Government Regulations Relating to Taxation
 
On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress or NPC, approved and promulgated the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law , which we refer to as the New EIT Law. The New EIT Law took effect on January 1, 2008. Under the New EIT Law, FIEs and domestic companies are subject to a uniform tax rate of 25%. The New EIT Law provides a five-year transition period starting from its effective date for those enterprises which were established before the promulgation date of the New EIT Law and which were entitled to a preferential lower tax rate under the then-effective tax laws or regulations.
 
On December 26, 2007, the State Council issued a Notice of Implementing Transitional Measures for Enterprise Income Tax, or the Notice, providing that the enterprises that have been approved to enjoy a low tax rate prior to the promulgation of the New EIT Law will be eligible for a five-year transition period since 1 January, 2008, during which time the tax rate will be increased step by step to the 25% unified tax rate set out in the New EIT Law. From 1 January, 2008, for the enterprises whose applicable tax rate was 15% before the promulgation of the New EIT Law, the tax rate will be increased to 18% for year 2008, 20% for year 2009, 22% for year 2010, 24% for year 2011, 25% for year 2012. For the enterprises whose applicable tax rate was 24%, the tax rate will be changed to 25% from January 1, 2008.
 
The New EIT Law provides that an income tax rate of 20% may be applicable to dividends payable to non-PRC investors that are “non-resident enterprises”. Non-resident enterprises refer to enterprises which do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or which have such establishment or place of business in the PRC but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC. The income tax for non-resident enterprises shall be subject to withholding at the income source, with the payor acting as the obligatory withholder under the New EIT Law, and therefore such income taxes generally called withholding tax in practice. The State Council of the PRC has reduced the withholding tax rate from 20% to 10% through the Implementation Rules of the New EIT Law. It is currently unclear in what circumstances a source will be considered as located within the PRC. We are a U.S. holding company and substantially all of our income is derived from dividends we receive from our subsidiaries located in the PRC. Thus, if we are considered as a “non-resident enterprise” under the New EIT Law and the dividends paid to us by our subsidiary in the PRC are considered income sourced within the PRC, such dividends may be subject to a 10% withholding tax.

Such income tax may be exempted or reduced by the State Council of the PRC or pursuant to a tax treaty between the PRC and the jurisdictions in which our non-PRC shareholders reside. For example, the 10% withholding tax is reduced to 5% pursuant to the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement Between Hong Kong and Mainland China if the beneficial owner in Hong Kong owns more than 25% of the registered capital in a company in the PRC.
 
The new tax law provides only a framework of the enterprise tax provisions, leaving many details on the definitions of numerous terms as well as the interpretation and specific applications of various provisions unclear and unspecified. Any increase in the combined company’s tax rate in the future could have a material adverse effect on its financial conditions and results of operations.
 
Regulations of Overseas Investments and Listings
 
On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including MOFCOM, CSRC, SASAC, SAT, SAIC and SAFE, jointly amended and released the M&A Rules, which became effective on September 8, 2006. This regulation, among other things, includes provisions that purport to require that an offshore SPV formed for purposes of overseas listing of equity interest in PRC companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals obtain the approval of CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such SPV’s securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, CSRC published on its official website procedures regarding its approval of overseas listings by SPVs. CSRC approval procedures require the filing of a number of documents with CSRC and it would take several months to complete the approval process. The application of the M&A Rules with respect to overseas listings of SPVs remains unclear with no consensus currently existing among the leading PRC law firms regarding the scope of the applicability of CSRC approval requirement.

In addition, according to the RSADC, companies that manufacture, store, transport or use dangerous chemicals shall be required to obtain corresponding approvals or licenses with the State Administration of Work Safety and its local branches and other proper authorities. Companies that manufacture or store dangerous chemicals without approval or registration with the proper authorities can be shut down, ordered to stop manufacturing or ordered to destroy the dangerous chemicals. Such companies can also be subject to fines. If criminal law is violated, the persons chiefly liable, along with other personnel directly responsible for such impropriety, shall be subject to relevant criminal liability.
