Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are in the business of acquiring, exploring and developing oil and gas-related assets. We formerly marketed the Safe Cell Tab product line, which consisted of products designed to protect users against the potentially harmful and damaging effects of electromagnetic radiation emitted from electrical devices. That segment of our business was discontinued in 2013. We have abandoned the assets after settling Safe Cell Tab related liabilities.
Historical Development
 
On October 12, 2012, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), entered into by and between the Company, Eos, and Eos Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Company Merger Sub"), Company Merger Sub merged into Eos, with Eos being the surviving entity (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, Eos became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Upon the closing of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Eos was automatically converted into the right to receive one share of our Series B convertible preferred stock ("Series B Preferred Stock"), effectively resulting in the former stockholders of Eos owning approximately 93% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock (including shares of Series B Preferred Stock convertible into shares of our common stock) and the holders of our previously outstanding debt and outstanding shares of our common stock owned the balance.

 After the Merger, Plethora Enterprises, LLC ("Plethora Enterprises"), a company wholly-owned by our CFO and Chairman of the Board, Nikolas Konstant, acquired control of the Company, holding 32,500,100 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock representing approximately 73% of our outstanding voting securities as of December 31, 2012.
 
Effective as of May 20, 2013, the Company changed its name to Eos Petro, Inc. (it previously had been named "Cellteck, Inc.") by filing an amendment to its articles of incorporation (the "Amendment") with the Nevada secretary of state after the name change was approved at a special meeting of the stockholders of the Company held on May 6, 2013.
 
The Amendment also effectuated a reverse stock split of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company held by stockholders with 2,000 or more aggregate shares of common stock at an exchange ratio of 1-for-800, accompanied by a cash distribution of $0.025 per share to all of the Company's common stockholders with less than 2,000 shares of common stock in the aggregate, in exchange for and in cancellation of their shares of common stock (the "Stock Split"). This Stock Split triggered the automatic conversion of all 45,275,044 issued and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock of the Company into 45,275,044 shares of common stock of the Company. The name change and Stock Split became effective on May 21, 2013.
 
Hereinafter, all references throughout this Report to securities of the Company will be referenced as post-split common shares, unless the context specifically otherwise requires, so that references to shares or common stock will be to post-split common shares instead of shares of Series B Preferred Stock.
 
Our Company was organized in British Columbia during 1996. Eos was incorporated in Delaware on May 2, 2011. On June 6, 2011, Eos acquired a 100% working interest and 80% net revenue interest in five oil and gas leases in an approximately 510 acre tract of land located in Albion in Edwards County, Illinois (the "Works Property"), which have historically produced oil since 1940.
 
The Company has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Eos and Eos Delaware (which was formed for a potential merger with Dune Energy, Inc., discussed further below). Eos itself also has two subsidiaries: Plethora Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eos, and EAOG, which is also 10% owned by one of our Ghanaian-based third party consultants. Plethora Energy also owns 90% of PBOG, which is also 10% owned by the same Ghanaian-based consultant. Eos, Eos Delaware, PBOG, Plethora Energy and EAOG are collectively referred to as the Company's "Subsidiaries."
 
Our Strategy
 
We are in the business of acquiring, exploring and developing oil and gas-related assets. Our strategy involves exploiting our existing asset base and acquiring new hydrocarbon reserves, resources and exploration acreage, where opportunities exist to enhance value, while assembling professional teams to use the latest technologies to explore for oil and gas. Commercial discoveries will be appraised and then, where deemed economic, and assuming the availability of the necessary financing, progressed through to the production stage. We anticipate that the cash flow generated from production will be reinvested in exploration and further development of oil and gas properties. In order to execute this strategy, after acquiring our first oil producing domestic property, the Works Property, we have applied to obtain rights to an oil concession in Africa. We are also evaluating other domestic and foreign properties for potential acquisitions.
Oil and Gas Production, Production Prices and Production Costs
 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, the Works Property produced approximately 6,742 net barrels of oil, for which the average sales price per barrel produced was $88. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, the Works Property produced approximately 8,779 net barrels of oil, for which the average sales price per barrel produced was $87. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the Works Property produced approximately 4,847 net barrels of oil, for which the average sales price per barrel produced was $43. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the Works Property produced approximately 1,211 net barrels of oil, for which the average sales price per barrel produced was $30.

For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, we estimate an average production cost per unit of oil of $62, our operating expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 were $354,046 and our total production costs were $401,642.
 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, we estimate an average production cost per unit of oil of $49, our operating expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 were $353,050 and our total production costs were $427,076.
 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we estimate an average production cost per unit of oil of $32, our operating expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 were $87,830 and our total production costs were $148,093.
 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we estimate an average production cost per unit of oil of $46, our operating expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 were $45,244 and our total production costs were $55,954.
 
Oil and Gas Properties, Wells, Operations and Acreage
 
As of December 31, 2015 and 2016, the Works Property had 8 productive wells over its approximately 700 acres. Of those 700 acres, there were 496 net and gross developed acres and 200 net and gross undeveloped acres.
 
For the last seven months of 2016 there was no production due to the lack of liquidity for development capital. We intend to provide development capital in the near future from one of our financings once they close.
 
Our oil and gas properties are subject to royalties and other customary outstanding interests. Our properties are also subject to an operating agreement, current taxes and insurance payments. Our properties have also been subject to certain liens, mortgages and other security interests. We do not believe that any of these burdens will materially interfere with the use of our properties.
 
Present Activities; Drilling and Other Exploratory and Development Activities
 
During 2013, we drilled three new wells and previously anticipated drilling three additional wells, but did not do so in 2015 or 2016 due to the declining price of oil.
 
Our oil and gas properties are subject to royalties and other customary outstanding interests. Our properties are also subject to an operating agreement, current taxes and insurance payments. Our properties have also been subject to certain liens, mortgages and other security interests. We do not believe that any of these burdens will materially interfere with the use of our properties.
 
On July 10, 2014 we entered into an operator agreement with James E. Blumthal ("Blumthal") to perform the services in connection with the production and sale of crude oil generated at the Works Property. We sell our crude oil and condensate obtained from the Works Property to Countrymark Refining and Logistics, LLC ("Countrymark"). We sell to Countrymark at prevailing daily market prices, which normally incorporate regional differentials that include but are not limited to transportation costs and adjustments for product quality.
 
Additional information regarding our profits and total assets can be found in the financial statements under Item 8 of this Report.
 
Safe Cell Tab Segment
 
Following the Merger, the Company's principal focus shifted to the oil and gas business. The Safe Cell Tab segment of our business was discontinued in 2013, and we have abandoned the assets after settling Safe Cell Tab related liabilities. Thus, this Report will not disclose separate information for the Safe Cell Tab segment.

Seasonality
 
Our business is not significantly impacted by seasonality.
 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
We do not own any patents, patent applications, service marks or trademarks.
 
Competition
 
Oil and Gas Competition
 
The oil and gas industry is competitive. We compete with numerous large international oil companies and smaller oil companies that target opportunities in the market similar to ours. Many of these companies have far greater economic, political and material resources at their disposal than we do. Members of our board of directors have prior experience in oil field development and production, operations, international business development, finance and experience in management and executive positions. Nevertheless, the markets in which we operate and plan to operate are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.
 
Higher commodity prices generally increase the demand for drilling rigs, supplies, services, equipment and crews, and can lead to shortages of, and increasing costs for, drilling equipment, services and personnel. In recent years, oil and natural gas companies have experienced higher drilling and operating costs. Shortages of, or increasing costs for, experienced drilling crews and equipment and services could restrict our ability to drill wells and conduct our operations. We expect we will depend upon independent drilling contractors to furnish rigs, equipment and tools to drill wells. Higher prices for oil and gas may result in competition among operators for drilling equipment, tubular goods and drilling crews which may affect or ability to expeditiously explore, drill, complete, recomplete and work-over wells.
 
Competition is also strong for attractive oil and natural gas producing assets, undeveloped license areas and drilling rights, and we cannot assure holders of our stock that we will be able to successfully compete when attempting to make further strategic acquisitions.
 
The market for oil and gas is dependent upon a number of factors beyond our control, which at times cannot be accurately predicted. These factors include the proximity of wells to, and the capacity of, natural gas pipelines, the extent of competitive domestic production and imports of oil and gas, the availability of other sources of energy, fluctuations in seasonal supply and demand, and governmental regulation. In addition, there is always the possibility that new legislation may be enacted, which would impose price controls or additional excise taxes upon crude oil.
 
The market price for crude oil is significantly affected by policies adopted by the member nations of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ("OPEC"). Members of OPEC establish prices and production quotas among themselves for petroleum products from time to time with the intent of controlling the current global supply and consequently price levels. We are unable to predict the effect, if any, that OPEC or other countries will have on the amount of, or the prices received for, crude oil.
 
Government Regulations
 
It is our policy to conduct all operations in a manner which protects people and property and which complies with all applicable laws and regulations. We recognize that prevention of accidents and ill health is essential to the efficient operation of our businesses, and both considerations are at least equal in prominence to operational and commercial considerations. Our principal health and safety objective is to provide a safe working environment for employees, contract personnel and members of the general public who may be put at risk by the activities of our companies.
Worldwide Regulations Generally
 
Our operations and our ability to finance and fund our growth strategy are affected by political developments and laws and regulations in the areas in which we operate. In particular, oil and natural gas production operations and economics are affected by:

4
-


• | Change in governments; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Civil unrest; 
• | Price and currency controls; 
• | Limitations on oil and natural gas production; 
• | Tax, environmental, safety and other laws relating to the petroleum industry; 
• | Changes in laws relating to the petroleum industry; 
• | Changes in administrative regulations and the interpretation and application of such rules and regulations; and
• | Changes in contract interpretation and policies of contract adherence 

 
In any country in which we may do business, the oil and natural gas industry legislation and agency regulation are periodically changed, sometimes retroactively, for a variety of political, economic, environmental and other reasons. Numerous governmental departments and agencies issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry, some of which carry substantial penalties for the failure to comply. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and our potential for economic loss.
 Risks Attendant to Foreign Operations
 
As discussed elsewhere herein, in 2016, we anticipate that a portion of our operations will be attributable to operations in foreign countries. International operations are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties and risks as disclosed more freely in the Report. Unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we may operate in could result in economic disruptions, increased costs and potential losses. Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and to changing domestic and international economic and political conditions which are beyond our control.
Environmental Regulations
 
We may be subject to various stringent and complex international, foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing matters including the emission and discharge of pollutants into the ground, air or water; the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of regulated materials; and the health and safety of our employees. These laws and regulations may, among other things:

• | Require the acquisition of various permits before operations commence; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Enjoin some or all of the operations of facilities deemed not in compliance with permits; 
• | Restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and natural gas drilling, production and transportation activities;
• | Limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain locations lying within protected or otherwise sensitive areas; and 
• | Require remedial measures to mitigate or remediate pollution from our operations. 

 
These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. Compliance with these laws can be costly; the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. We cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with such laws, or that environmental laws and regulations will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment continues to increase. Offshore drilling in some areas has been opposed by environmental groups and, in other areas, has been restricted. In connection with our strategy of expansion into Africa, our operations could be adversely affected to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts offshore drilling or imposes environmental requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general, such as more stringent or costly waste handling, disposal, cleanup requirements or financial responsibility and assurance requirements.
 
International Climate Change Efforts
 
Oil and gas operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and government regulations that may change from time to time. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, well testing, plug and abandonment requirements and bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas. Other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating primarily to the protection of human health and the environment apply to the development, production, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of oil and gas, by-products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and gas operations, including drilling fluids and wastewater. In addition, we may incur costs arising out of property damage, including environmental damage caused by previous owners or operators of property we purchase or lease or relating to third party sites, or injuries to employees and other persons. As a result, we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities and may be required to incur substantial remediation costs. We also are subject to changing and extensive tax laws, the effects of which cannot be predicted. Compliance with existing, new or modified laws and regulations could result in substantial costs, delay our operations or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
 
Moreover, changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and such laws and regulations tend to become more stringent over time. Increased scrutiny of our industry may also occur as a result of the Environmental Protection Agency's ("EPA") 2011-2016 National Enforcement Initiative, "Assuring Energy Extraction Activities Comply with Environmental Laws," through which EPA will address incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities that may cause or contribute to significant harm to public health or the environment. Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our compliance costs and negatively impact our production and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
 
There is increasing attention in the United States and worldwide being paid to the issue of climate change and the contributing effect of GHG emissions. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing oil and gas exploration in the areas in which we operate could materially and adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities or imposing materially increased costs.
 
Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and gas wells, particularly in unconventional resource plays. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and gas production. The U.S. Congress has considered legislation to subject hydraulic fracturing operations to federal regulation and to require the disclosure of chemicals used by us and others in the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and has released draft permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing operations that use diesel fuel in fracturing fluids in those states where EPA is the permitting authority. A number of federal agencies are also analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. For example, the EPA is conducting a comprehensive research study to investigate the potential adverse environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing, including on water quality and public health. The EPA released a progress report outlining work currently underway on December 21, 2012. A draft report that compiles the results of various research projects was released in 2015 for peer review and comment. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their course and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or other regulatory mechanisms. President Obama has created the Interagency Working Group on Unconventional Natural Gas and Oil by Executive Order, which is charged with coordinating and aligning federal agency research and scientific studies on unconventional natural gas and oil resources. In addition, the EPA announced its intention to propose regulations in 2015 under the federal Clean Water Act to regulate waste water discharges from hydraulic fracturing and other natural gas production.
 
Several states have proposed or adopted legislative or regulatory restrictions on hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements, public disclosure of fracturing fluid contents, water sampling requirements, and operational restrictions. Further, some cities and municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting bans on drilling. At the international level, the U.K. and EU Parliaments have each in the past discussed Implementing a drilling moratorium.
 
From time to time legislation is introduced in the U.S. Congress that, if enacted into law, would make significant changes to United States tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. These or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could defer or eliminate certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.
