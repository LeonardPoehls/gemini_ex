Item 1. Business
General Overview
We were incorporated on March 16, 2007 under the name "Northstar Healthcare Inc." pursuant to the provisions of the British Columbia Business Corporations Act (BCBCA). On December 5, 2014, Northstar Healthcare Inc. changed its name to Nobilis Health Corp. ("Nobilis" or the "Company"). Prior to December 1, 2014, our business was solely the ownership, operation and management of outpatient surgery centers and specialty surgical hospitals (the “Medical Segment”). On December 1, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Athas Health, LLC (“Athas”). This acquisition added marketing services as a stand-alone business line, which is now a separate reportable business segment (the “Marketing Segment”). In addition to providing services to third parties, our unique direct-to-patient marketing and proprietary technology serves our own healthcare facilities.
Our portfolio of specialty surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs), and multi-specialty clinics ( the "Nobilis Facilities") is complemented by our Marketing Segment, which allows us to operate those facilities in many instances with few, if any, physician partners. Our differentiated business strategy provides value to patients, physicians and payors, and enables us to capitalize on recent trends in the healthcare industry, particularly with regard to increased consumerism in the healthcare space. As a result, we believe we are positioned for continued growth.
As of December 31, 2017, there are 33 locations across Texas and Arizona, including specialty surgical hospitals ( the "Nobilis Hospitals"), ASCs ( the "Nobilis ASCs") and multi-specialty clinics. Additionally, Nobilis partnered with another 34 facilities across the country, and marketed 9 independent brands. We provide care across a variety of specialties in our facilities including, pain management, spine surgery, orthopedic surgery, bariatric surgery, plastic surgery, ear nose and throat (ENT), podiatric surgery, vein and vascular, and other general surgery. 
Many of our surgical patients require additional complementary healthcare services and Nobilis has spent the last two years developing a full suite of ancillary services that we offer patients treated in our facilities. To date, Nobilis is able to provide a variety of in-house ancillary services, such as Anesthesia, Surgical Assist, and Intraoperative Neuromonitoring ("IOM"), (collectively, "Nobilis Ancillary Service Lines"). The addition of the ancillary services has helped us successfully expand our continuum of care, increase facility efficiency, improve our coordination of the various services they require, enhance the quality of our patients’ clinical outcomes as well as their overall experience.
On October 28, 2016 and March 8, 2017, we purchased Arizona Vein and Vascular Center, LLC and its four affiliated surgery centers operating as Arizona Center for Minimally Invasive Surgery, LLC, (collectively, "AZ Vein") and Hamilton Vein Center ("HVC") brand and associated assets, respectively. These acquisitions expanded our specialty mix to include the treatment of venous diseases with little modification to our existing infrastructure of specialty surgical hospitals and ASCs. Our facilities will be able to offer a range of treatments, both surgical and non-surgical, for those patients suffering from venous diseases, which today affect more than 30 million Americans.
In addition to our vein and vascular business acquisitions, on September 13, 2017, we purchased DeRosa Medical, P.C. ("DeRosa"). DeRosa is a primary care practice that specializes in health and wellness, medically supervised weight loss, women's health, and chronic health condition management. The practice operates three multi-specialty clinics within the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area, specifically in Scottsdale, Chandler, and Glendale. The acquisition of DeRosa allows the Company to expand its continuum of care by providing additional healthcare services at the primary care level.
On November 15, 2017, the Company purchased 50.1% ownership interests in Elite Sinus Spine and Ortho LLC, Elite Center for Minimally Invasive Surgery, LLC, Houston Metro Ortho and Spine Surgery Center, LLC and Elite Hospital Management, LLC (collectively the "Management Companies" or collectively, "Elite") that manage three ASCs and one specialty surgical hospital in Houston, TX. Elite provides healthcare management services to these facilities, which generate 100% in-network revenue to the Nobilis system. This acquisition represents a strategic opportunity to enhance Nobilis' in-network revenue and adds 76 physician partners to our existing network of surgeons in the Houston market. We will also have the opportunity to leverage best practices from both companies, generate operational efficiencies, further improve our case conversion through a substantial increase in referral-based business and provide the Company additional resources to strengthen Nobilis' footprint within the Houston market.
Our growth strategy focuses on:

• | Marketing Expertise Drives Organic Growth: support organic growth in facilities that we own and operate through large scale multi-media marketing and sales efforts; and


• | Acquisitions Opportunities: Expand the Company's continuum of care capabilities via addition of key service lines and diverse revenue streams, paying focus to the In-network market.

7


• | Operational Efficiency: Leverage acquisitions and company growth to drive cost reductions and achieve greater economies of scale.

Recent Developments 

• | Elite Acquisition - In November 2017, we closed and acquired Elite's hospital and three ASCs operating as Elite Surgical Affiliates. For more information on this acquisition, see Note 3 - Acquisitions of Part II, Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.


• | BBVA Financing Amendment No.2 (the "Amendment") - On November 15, 2017, Northstar Healthcare Acquisitions, L.L.C. (the “Borrower”), a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Nobilis Health Corp. (the “Company”) and Northstar Healthcare Holdings, Inc. a Delaware corporation entered into the Amendment with the purpose of financing the Elite acquisition, and thereby increased the aggregate principal amount by $50,000,000 (“Term Loan B”). The maturity date of Term Loan B is November 15, 2022 with payments due quarterly. 


• | The Note - in addition to the Amendment noted above, the Company issued a sellers note in the principal amount of $3.5 million bearing interest at the simple rate of 6.75% per annum and payable in three installments over a two year period. For more information on this note, see Note 3 - Acquisitions of Part II, Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 


• | Corporate Governance - Effective as of November 16, 2017, Harry Fleming was appointed to the Board of Directors and was subsequently appointed to serve as Chairman of the Board following Dr. Donald L. Kramer resignation as Chairman and retirement from the Board of Directors.

Government Regulation 
We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. Government regulation affects our business by controlling our growth, requiring licensure and certification for our facilities and the physicians and other healthcare personnel who provide services in our facilities and regulating the use of our properties.
Licensure and Accreditation
Our healthcare facilities are subject to professional and private licensing, certification and accreditation requirements. These include, but are not limited to, requirements imposed by Medicare, Medicaid, state licensing authorities, voluntary accrediting organizations and third-party private payors. Receipt and renewal of such licenses, certifications and accreditations are often based on inspections, surveys, audits, investigations or other reviews, some of which may require affirmative compliance actions by us that could be burdensome and expensive.
The applicable standards may change in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain all necessary licenses or certifications in good standing or that they will not be required to incur substantial costs in doing so. The failure to maintain all necessary licenses, certifications and accreditations in good standing, or the expenditure of substantial funds to maintain them, could have an adverse effect on our business.
Anti-Kickback Statute
The United States Medicare/Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Anti-kickback Statute (the “Anti-Kickback Statute”) prohibits “knowingly or willfully” paying money or providing remuneration of any sort in exchange for federally-funded referrals. Because the physician partners that have ownership interests in certain of the Nobilis Facilities (the “Physician Limited Partners”) are in a position to generate referrals to the Nobilis Facilities, distributions of profits to these Physician Limited Partners could come under scrutiny under the Anti-Kickback Statute. While the Department of Health and Human Services has issued regulations containing “safe harbors” to the Anti-Kickback Statute, including those specifically applicable to ASCs, our operations and arrangements do not comply with all of the requirements. As we do not have the benefit of the safe harbors, we are not immune from government review or prosecution. However, we believe that our operations are structured to substantially comply with applicable anti-kickback laws. To the extent safe harbor protection is not available, the agreements governing the structure and operations of our facilities include provisions to mitigate against alleged kickbacks or other inducements.
The State of Texas and the State of Arizona each maintain its own version of the Anti-Kickback Statute (the “Non-solicitation Laws”). In Texas, the relevant law is called the Texas Patient Solicitation Act (TPSA). The TPSA prohibits payment of remuneration for referrals and violations can result in state criminal and civil penalties. Because the TPSA is based on the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the risks described above also arise under this state law except that the TPSA arguably is not limited to claims for treatment of federal program beneficiaries. In Arizona, A.R.S §13-3713 makes it unlawful for a person to knowingly offer, deliver, receive, or accept any rebate, refund, commission, preference or other consideration in exchange for a patient, client or customer referral 
8

to any individual, pharmacy, laboratory, clinic or health care institution providing medical or health-related services or items under A.R.S. § 11-291 et seq., providing for indigent care, or A.R.S. § 36-2901 et seq., or providing for the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, other than specifically provided under those sections. A violator of the relevant Arizona laws is guilty of: a class 3 felony for payment of $1,000 or more; a class 4 felony for payment of more than $100 but less than $1,000; or a class 6 felony for payment of $100 or less.
The Non-solicitation Laws parallel in many respects the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, but they apply more broadly because they are not limited only to providers participating in federal and state health care programs. The Texas statute specifically provides that it permits any payment, business arrangement or payment practice that is permitted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and regulations promulgated under that law, although failure to fall within a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates Texas law. Arizona takes the same approach.
Some of the various arrangements that we enter into with providers may not fit into a safe harbor to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and thus may not be exempt from scrutiny under the Non-solicitation Laws. Although an arrangement that fits a federal safe harbor may also be exempt from the prohibitions of the Non-solicitation Laws, the burden is on the medical provider to prove that the questioned arrangement fits one of the federal safe harbors. Additionally, even if that burden is met, the provider must still comply with the law’s requirements to disclose to the patient the financial relationship involved. A failure by us to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, TPSA or Arizona laws could have an adverse effect on our business.
Corporate Practice of Medicine
Texas law generally does not permit business corporations to practice medicine, exercise control over the professional decisions of physicians who practice medicine or engage in various business practices, such as employing physicians. A widely used statutory exception in Texas is for the employment of physicians by non-profit health corporations that are certified by the Texas Medical Board under Section 162.001(b) of the Texas Occupations Code. We contract some professional services through this structure. Similarly, Texas and Arizona prohibit fee-splitting arrangements with physicians where professional fees of physicians are shared with non-physician persons or non-physician owned entities. The physicians who perform procedures at our facilities or who perform contracted physician services are individually licensed to practice medicine. In most instances within our Medical Segment, the physicians are not affiliated with us other than through the physicians’ ownership in the limited partnerships and limited liability companies that own certain of our facilities and through the service agreements we have with some physicians. The laws in many states regarding the corporate practice of medicine have been subjected to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation, and interpretation and enforcement of these laws vary significantly from state to state. Therefore, we cannot provide assurances that our activities, if challenged, will be found to be in compliance with these laws.
False Claims Legislation
Under the United States Criminal False Claims Act, individuals or entities that knowingly file false or fraudulent claims that are payable by the Medicare or Medicaid programs are subject to both criminal and civil liability. While we have a compliance program and policies to create a corporate culture of compliance with these laws, failure to comply could result in monetary penalties (up to three times the amount of damages), fines and/or imprisonment, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
HIPAA
We are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which mandates industry standards for the exchange of protected health information, including electronic health information. While we believe that we have implemented privacy and security systems to bring us into material compliance with HIPAA, we cannot ensure that the business associates to whom we provide information will comply with HIPAA standards. If we, for whatever reasons, fail to comply with the standards, or any state statute that governs an individual’s right to privacy that are not pre-empted by HIPAA, we could be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
We may be affected by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which began taking effect in 2010. The impact on us remains uncertain. By mandating that residents obtain minimum levels of health insurance coverage, the PPACA has expanded the overall number of insured patients. However, it remains to be seen whether the cost born by employers of providing insurance coverage will result in a shift away from the types of policies that have historically provided the coverage that we have relied upon in the past. Further, as discussed above, the impact that value-based purchasing initiatives could have on our revenues remains unclear. We continue to review the potential impact of the PPACA’s provisions on its business as the out-of-network reimbursement under the policies issued by the state exchange might be substantially lower than those by the employer-sponsored polices.

Antitrust
Federal and state antitrust laws restrict the ability of competitors, including physicians and other providers, to act in concert in restraint of trade, to fix prices for services, to allocate territories, to tie the purchase of one product to the purchase of another product or to attempt to monopolize a market for services.
Notwithstanding our efforts to fully comply with all antitrust laws, a significant amount of ambiguity exists with respect to the application of these laws to healthcare activities. Thus, no assurance can be provided that an enforcement action or judicial proceeding will not be brought against us or that we will not be liable for substantial penalties, fines and legal expenses.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
Typical health care provider operations include, but are not limited to, in various combinations, the handling, use, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal and/or discharge of hazardous, infectious, toxic, radioactive and flammable materials, wastes, pollutants or contaminants. As such, health care provider operations are particularly susceptible to the practical, financial, and legal risks associated with the obligations imposed by applicable environment laws and regulations. Such risks may (i) result in damage to individuals, property, or the environment; (ii) interrupt operations and/or increase their cost; (iii) result in legal liability, damages, injunctions, or fines; (iv) result in investigations, administrative proceedings, civil litigation, criminal prosecution, penalties or other governmental agency actions; and (v) may not be covered by insurance. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter such risks in the future, and such risks may result in material adverse consequences to our operations or financial results.
Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations
Our business, in particular our Marketing Segment, is affected by consumer protection laws and regulations. Government regulations may directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of health services, advertising and marketing services we provide. Such regulation may seek, among other things, to limit our ability to advertise for certain products and services. In addition, there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices, which could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services. Any limitation or judicial action that effects our ability to meet our clients’ needs or reduces client spending on our services could affect our business.
Most states regulate advertising related to healthcare. Most of these laws and regulations address the obligations of a licensed professional to accurately describe his or her credentials, the efficacy of treatments offered by the professional and the risks to a potential patient of such treatments. In some states it is unclear what rules apply to advertisers of healthcare services who are not licensed professionals. If we determine that regulatory requirements in a given state prevent one or more of our Marketing Segment programs, we may be required to cease contracting with physicians and healthcare facilities in that state and to cease marketing services to citizens of that state. However, if advertising requirements on the whole become overly burdensome, we may elect to terminate operations or particular marketing services programs entirely or avoid introducing particular Marketing Segment programs. In some states we have modified the compensation structure of our Marketing Segment programs to reduce uncertainty regarding our compliance with state laws.
The Federal Trade Commission enforces Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC), which prohibits deceptive or unfair practices in or affecting commerce, and Section 12 of the FTC Act, which prohibits the dissemination of any false advertisement to induce the purchase of any food, drug, device, or service. An ad is deceptive under Section 5 of the FTC Act if it has a statement – or omits information – that: 1) is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances; and 2) is “material” – that is, important to a consumer’s decision to buy or use the product. An ad or business practice is unfair if: 1) it causes or is likely to cause substantial consumer injury that a consumer could not reasonably avoid; and 2) the injury is not outweighed by any benefit the practice provides to consumers or competition. These consumer protection laws apply equally to marketers across all mediums, whether delivered on a desktop computer, a mobile device, or more traditional media such as television, radio, or print. If a disclosure is needed to prevent an online ad claim from being deceptive or unfair, it must be clear and conspicuous. Under the FTC guidance, this means advertisers should ensure that the disclosure is clear and conspicuous on all devices and platforms that consumers may use to view the ad. FTC guidance also explains that if an advertisement without a disclosure would be deceptive or unfair, or would otherwise violate a rule, and the disclosure cannot be made clearly and conspicuously on a device or platform, then that device or platform should not be used. It may be difficult or impossible for us to know precisely how clearly a disclosure appears on a particular platform which may cause our disclosures to be inadequate. This may subject us to significant penalties, including statutory damages.
Under the FTC Act, ads, promotional brochures, informational tapes, seminars and other forms of marketing of surgical services to consumers should not have express or implied claims that are false or unsubstantiated, or that omit material information. In particular, claims that convey an inaccurate impression about the safety, efficacy, success or other benefits of any form of surgery would raise concerns about deception. Claims about success rates, long-term stability, or predictability of outcome must be 
10

substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence. The standard of review of these disclosures is viewed from the perspective of the “reasonable person”. However, this standard can be difficult to apply when promoting new and innovative surgical procedures and techniques such as the ones we promote. A failure on our part to fully describe risk factors or to make assertions that are alleged to be lacking in scientific support could subject us to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions and associated reputational harm.
Our business could be adversely affected by newly-adopted or amended laws, rules, regulations and orders relating to telemarketing and increased enforcement of such laws, rules, regulations or orders by governmental agencies or by private litigants. One example of recent regulatory changes that may affect our business is the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). Regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission under the TCPA that became effective October 16, 2013 require the prior express written consent of the called party before a caller can initiate telemarketing calls (i) to wireless numbers (including text messaging) using an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice; or (ii) to residential lines using an artificial or prerecorded voice. Failure to comply with the TCPA can result in significant penalties, including statutory damages. Our efforts to comply with these regulations may negatively affect conversion rates of leads.
Other Regulations
In addition to the regulatory initiatives described above, healthcare facilities, including the Nobilis Facilities, are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may affect their operations, facilities, and properties. Violations of these laws could subject us to civil penalties and fines for not investigating and remedying any contamination by hazardous substances, as well as other liability from third parties.
Federal Stark Law
The Federal Stark Law, also known as the physician self-referral law, prohibits a physician from referring Medicare patients to an entity (including specialty surgical hospitals) for the furnishing of “designated health services,” if the physician or a member of the physician’s immediate family has a direct or indirect “financial relationship” with the entity, unless a specific exception applies, and further prohibits the entity from billing for any services that arise out of such prohibited referrals. Certain of these provisions are applicable to the referral of Medicaid patients as well. Designated health services include the following services when they may be paid for by the Medicare program: inpatient and outpatient hospital services; clinical laboratory services; radiology and certain other imaging services; physical therapy services, occupational therapy services, and outpatient speech-language pathology services; durable medical equipment and supplies; outpatient prescription drugs; home health services; radiation services and supplies; parental and eternal nutrients, equipment and supplies; and prosthetics, orthotics, and prosthetic devices and supplies, all of which are services that our affiliated physicians may order. The prohibition applies regardless of the rationale for the financial relationship and the reason for ordering the service. Therefore, intent to commit an illegal act is not required in order for the government to prove that a physician has violated the Stark Law. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law contains a number of statutory and regulatory exceptions that protect certain types of transactions and business arrangements from penalty. When the Stark Law applies to a referral, compliance with all elements of an applicable Stark Law exception is necessary in order to avoid violation of the statute.
The penalties for violating the Stark Law include the denial of payment for services ordered in violation of the statute, mandatory refunds of any sums paid for such services, civil penalties of up to $15,000 for each violation, assessments up to three times the amount of each claim for Medicare reimbursement knowingly made for services ordered in violation of the statute, and possible exclusion from future participation in governmental healthcare programs. A physician or an entity that engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibitions may be fined up to $100,000 for each applicable arrangement or scheme. Knowing submission of a claim in violation of the Stark Law may also result in a False Claims Act allegation.
Some states have enacted statutes and regulations similar to the Stark Law, but which may be applicable to the referral of patients regardless of their payor source and which may apply to different types of services. These state laws may contain statutory and regulatory exceptions that are different from those of the federal law and that may vary from state to state.
Competition
Within the Texas and Arizona markets, we currently compete with traditional hospitals, specialty surgical hospitals and other ASCs to attract both physicians and patients. Specialty surgical hospitals generally have an advantage over ASCs with respect to the negotiation of insurance contracts and competition for physicians’ inpatient and outpatient practices. Specialty surgical hospitals also offer a much broader and specialized range of medical services (enabling them to service a broader patient population) and generally have longer operating histories and greater financial resources, and are better known in the general community.
The competition among ASCs and specialty surgical hospitals for physicians and patients has intensified in recent years. As a result, some specialty surgical hospitals have been acquiring physician practices and employing the physicians to work for the 
11

specialty surgical hospitals. These specialty surgical hospitals incentivize physicians to utilize the specialty surgical hospitals' facilities. Further, some traditional hospitals have recently formed joint ventures with physicians whereby the hospital manages, but the hospital and physicians jointly own, an ASC.
In addition, there are several large, publicly traded companies, divisions or subsidiaries of large publicly traded companies, and several private companies that develop and acquire ASCs and specialty surgical hospitals. These companies may compete with us in the acquisition of additional ASCs and specialty surgical hospitals. For instance, publicly-traded Envision Healthcare (NYSE: EVHC), owns 263 ASCs and employs over 26,000 physician partners and APP’s across 46 states. Other leaders in our market include Tenet Healthcare (NYSE: THC), Surgery Partners (NYSE: SGRY) and Hospital Corporation of America (NYSE: HCA).
Further, many physician groups develop ASCs without a corporate partner, using consultants who typically perform corporate services for a fee and who may take a small equity interest in the ongoing operations of such ASCs. See "Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Business – We Face Significant Competition From Other Healthcare Providers."
Based on our innovative approach, we believe we are well positioned in our current markets as a surgical services and marketing services platform of choice for patients and physicians. Our focus on providing care, complemented by our unique Marketing Segment offerings, is a key differentiating factor of our strategy. We believe this approach drives physician engagement, better coordination of care with patients, continuous clinical and administrative improvement and enhanced efficiency.
Seasonality
The surgical segment of the healthcare industry tends to be impacted by seasonality due to the nature of most benefit plans resetting on a calendar year basis. As patients utilize and reduce their remaining deductible throughout the year, ASCs and surgical specialty surgical hospitals typically see an increase in volume throughout the year with the biggest impact coming in the fourth quarter. Historically, approximately 35-40% of our annual revenues have been recognized in the fourth quarter. 
Facility Operations
See Part I. Item 2. Properties for details on the Company's facilities. 
Employees
As of March 12, 2018, we had approximately 900 employees, of which approximately 700 are full time.
Intellectual Property 
We own intellectual property including service marks, trade secrets and other proprietary information. Depending on the jurisdiction, service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. 
Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. As such, we are eligible for exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the effectiveness of our first registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which was June 4, 2015 (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, (3) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of common shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. We have elected not to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.
