 Overview
 PCTEL, Inc. (“PCTEL”, the “Company”, “we”, “ours”, and “us”) delivers Performance Critical TELecom technology solutions to the wireless industry. We are a leading global supplier of antennas and wireless network testing solutions. PCTEL Connected Solutions segment designs and manufactures precision antennas. PCTEL antennas are deployed in small cells, enterprise Wi-Fi access points, fleet management and transit systems, and in network equipment and devices for the Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”). PCTEL RF Solutions segment provides test tools that improve the performance of wireless networks globally. Mobile operators, neutral hosts, and equipment manufacturers rely on PCTEL to analyze, design, and optimize next generation wireless networks.
 PCTEL was incorporated in California in 1994 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1998.  Our principal executive offices are located at 471 Brighton Drive, Bloomingdale, Illinois 60108.  Our telephone number at that address is (630) 372-6800 and our website is www.pctel.com.  The information within, or that can be accessed through, our website, is not part of this report.
 Segment Reporting
 PCTEL operates in two segments for reporting purposes, Connected Solutions and RF Solutions.  Our chief operating decision maker uses operating profits and identified assets for the Connected Solutions and RF Solutions segments for resource allocations.  Each segment has its own segment manager as well as its own engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions.  All of our accounting and finance, human resources, IT and legal functions are provided on a centralized basis through the corporate function. We manage the balance sheet and cash flows centrally at the corporate level, with the exception of trade accounts receivable and inventory which is managed at the segment level. Each of the segment managers reports to and maintains regular contact with the chief operating decision maker to discuss operating activities, financial results, forecasts, or plans for the segment.
Connected Solutions Segment
 PCTEL’s Connected Solutions segment designs and manufactures precision antennas. Our antennas are deployed primarily in small cells, enterprise Wi-Fi access points, fleet management and transit systems, and in equipment and devices for the IIoT. We offer in-house design, testing, radio integration, and manufacturing capabilities for our antenna customers.  Revenue growth in these markets is driven by the increased use of wireless communications and increased complexity occurring in these markets. Our antennas are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) providers where they are designed into the customer’s solution.
 Competition in the antenna markets addressed by Connected Solutions is fragmented. Competitors include Airgain, Amphenol, Laird, Pulse, and Taoglas. We seek out product applications that command a premium for product performance and customer service, and we avoid commodity markets.
 PCTEL maintains expertise in several technology areas in order to be competitive in the antenna market.  These include radio frequency engineering, mobile antenna design and manufacturing, mechanical engineering, product quality and testing, and wireless network engineering.

RF Solutions Segment
 PCTEL’s RF Solutions segment provides test tools that improve the performance of wireless networks globally, with a focus on LTE, public safety, and emerging 5G technologies.  Network operators, neutral hosts, and equipment manufacturers rely on our scanning receivers and testing solutions to analyze, design, and optimize their networks. Revenue growth is driven by the implementation and roll out of new wireless technology standards (i.e. 3G to 4G, 4G to 5G). Our test equipment is sold directly to wireless carriers or to OEMs who integrate our products into their solutions which are then sold to wireless carriers.
 Competitors for our test tool products include OEMs such as Anritsu, Berkley Varitronics, Digital Receiver Technology, and Rohde and Schwarz.
 PCTEL maintains expertise in several technology areas in order to be competitive in the test tool market. These include radio frequency engineering, digital signal process (“DSP”) engineering, manufacturing, mechanical engineering, product quality and testing, and wireless network engineering.
 Discontinued Operations
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, we approved a plan to sell our Network Engineering Service business (“Engineering Services”) and shift our focus toward research and development driven radio frequency (“RF”) products. On July 31, 2017, we sold substantially all of the assets of our Engineering Services business to Gabe’s Construction Co., Inc. (“Gabe’s”) for a purchase price of $1.45 million in cash. The Engineering Services business provided design, testing, commissioning, optimization, and consulting services for cellular, Wi-Fi and public safety networks, and was a reporting unit within the RF Solutions segment. We classified assets of the Engineering Services reporting unit as held for sale at December 31, 2016 and reported the results of its operations as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The financial information presented in this Form 10-K has been restated to reflect the historical results of Engineering Services as discontinued operations. See Note 4 in the notes to the financial statements for more information on discontinued operations.

Backlog
 Sales of our products are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders, which are officially acknowledged according to standard terms and conditions.  The backlog is useful for scheduling production but is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future product revenues as the order to ship cycle is short.
Research and Development
 We recognize that a strong technology base is essential to our long-term success and we have made a substantial investment in engineering, research and development.  We will continue to devote substantial resources to product development and patent submissions.  The patent submissions are primarily for defensive purposes, rather than for potential license revenue generation.  We monitor changing customer needs and work closely with our customers, consultants and market research organizations to track changes in the marketplace, including emerging industry standards.
 Research and development expenses include costs for hardware and related software development, prototyping, certification and pre-production costs.  We spent approximately $11.1 million, $10.2 million, and $11.2 million in the fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, in research and development.
 Sales, Marketing and Support
 We supply our products to public and private carriers, wireless infrastructure providers, wireless equipment distributors, value added resellers (“VARs”) and OEMs.  PCTEL’s direct sales force is technologically sophisticated and sales executives have strong industry domain knowledge.  Our direct sales force supports the sales efforts of our distributors and OEM resellers.
 Our marketing strategy is focused on building market awareness and acceptance of our new products.  The marketing organization also provides a wide range of programs, materials and events to support the sales organization.  We spent approximately $12.6 million, $12.7 million, and $13.0 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, for sales and marketing support.
 Manufacturing
 We do final assembly of most of our antenna products and all of our OEM receiver and interference management product lines.  We also have arrangements with several contract manufacturers but are not dependent on any specific contract manufacturer.  If any of our contract manufacturers are unable to provide satisfactory services for us, other contract manufacturers are available, although engaging a new contract manufacturer could cause delays and additional costs.  We have no material guaranteed supply contracts or long-term agreements with any of our suppliers. We do have open purchase orders with our suppliers.  See the contractual obligations and commercial commitments section of Item 7 for information on purchase commitments.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 484 full-time equivalent employees, consisting of 342 in operations, 56 in research and development, 49 in sales and marketing, and 37 in general and administrative functions.  Total full-time equivalent employees were 430 and 403 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Headcount increased by 54 at December 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily due to production employees.  None of our employees are represented by a labor union.  We consider employee relations to be good.
