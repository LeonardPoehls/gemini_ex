ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
K2M, Inc. was incorporated in 2004 and began working with leading spine surgeons for the purpose of designing, developing and commercializing innovative and proprietary complex spine technologies and techniques. In 2010, K2M Group Holdings, Inc., an entity then controlled by Welsh, Carson, Andersen & Stowe, acquired K2M, Inc. Certain affiliates of Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe are referred to herein as “WCAS,” and WCAS, and together with the other owners of K2M Group Holdings, Inc. prior to our May 2014 initial public offering, are collectively referred to as our “pre-IPO owners.” Since 2010, we have continued to invest in our business by expanding our global distribution network, including through the investment of additional capital raised from our pre-IPO owners, our initial public offering in May 2014, subsequent public offerings in February and July 2015 and issuance of convertible senior notes in August 2016. As of March 2017, WCAS is no longer a shareholder of K2M Group Holdings, Inc. Until the end of 2017, we were an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as modified by the JOBS Act of 2012. Based on the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of June 30, 2017, we no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company” and are no longer exempt from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies.
We are a global leader of complex spine and minimally invasive solutions focused on achieving three-dimensional Total Body Balance. Our complex spine products are used by spine surgeons to treat some of the most difficult and challenging spinal pathologies, such as deformity (primarily scoliosis), trauma and tumor. We believe these procedures typically receive a higher rate of positive insurance coverage and often generate more revenue per procedure as compared to traditional degenerative spine surgery procedures. We have applied our product development expertise in innovating complex spine technologies and techniques to the design, development and commercialization of an expanding number of proprietary minimally invasive surgery (“MIS”) products. These proprietary MIS products are designed to allow for less invasive access to the spine and faster patient recovery times as compared to traditional open access surgical approaches. In addition, we have utilized these core competencies in the design, development and commercialization of a comprehensive portfolio of products designed for use with patients suffering from degenerative spinal conditions.
Our products primarily consist of implants, disposables and instruments which are typically marketed and sold to hospitals for use by spine surgeons. As of December 31, 2017, our product portfolio contains 99 product lines that are used in complex spine, MIS and degenerative surgeries, enabling us to effectively compete in the $10.8 billion global spinal surgery market. We believe many of our products offer simplified surgical techniques and promote improved clinical outcomes for patients, although their quality, safety and efficacy are not yet supported by long-term clinical data. 
Across many of our spinal devices, we have begun to apply our Lamellar 3D Titanium Technology, which uses an advanced 3D-printing method to create structures that are considered impractical when using traditional manufacturing techniques. Starting with a titanium powder, spinal devices are grown through the selective application of a high-energy laser beam, allowing for the incorporation of a porosity and surface roughness that we believe, based on pre-clinical data, have associated with bone growth activity.
Our focus on our core competences of complex spine and MIS is highlighted by the fact that 56.1% of our revenue in the United States, including the territory of Puerto Rico, for the year ended December 31, 2017 was derived from the use of our products in complex spine and MIS surgeries. We believe this represents a greater proportion of total revenue devoted to these markets as compared to our competitors. We further believe the proportion of our international revenue derived from complex spine and MIS is even higher than in the United States.
We have also leveraged our core competences into Balance ACS, a comprehensive platform of products, services and research designed to help surgeons achieve three-dimensional spinal balance across the axial, coronal and sagittal planes, with the goal of supporting the full continuum of care continuum to help facilitate quality patient outcomes. The Balance ACS platform, in 
 5

combination with our technologies, techniques and leadership in the 3D-printing of spinal devices, enables us to compete favorably in the global spinal surgery market.
Some of our key proprietary technologies include:

• | EVEREST: a family of products featuring spinal screw technology for deformity, MIS and degenerative spinal pathologies that we believe, based on internal testing, provides for improved insertion speed, industry-leading pull-out strength and the versatility to accommodate a variety of titanium and cobalt chrome rods of two different diameters, which has been used to treat more than 35,000 patients;


• | MESA: a family of products featuring low-profile spinal screw technology that is used primarily during deformity correction, featuring our proprietary locking mechanism that eliminates the need for a secondary locking feature and reduces rotational force on the spine during implantation, which has been used to treat more than 60,000 patients;

This versatile family of products offers various design configurations, which include 3D-printed (featuring Lamellar 3D Titanium Technology) static and expandable devices that allow for in-situ height and endplate adjustment; 


• | RAVINE Lateral: minimally invasive lateral retractor systems, developed to work in conjunction with the CASCADIA Lateral 3D Interbody System, that represents an innovative design departure from standard tubular retractors, facilitating retractor placement, positioning and fixation to the patient’s anatomy to allow for endplate to endplate visualization and multi-level balance through a lateral access approach; and


• | RHINE Cervical: a cervical disc system featuring a one-piece compressible polymer core design with dome-shaped, plasma-coated endplates and a central-split keel, with proprietary molding technology incorporated to minimize wear between the polymer core and metal titanium alloy endplates.

We have grown our revenue to $258.0 million in 2017 from $135.1 million in 2012, representing a five-year Compounded Annual Growth Rate (“CAGR”) of 14%. For 2017, 2016 and 2015 our net loss was $37.1 million, $41.7 million and $39.2 million, respectively, and our Adjusted EBITDA was $(0.7) million, $1.4 million and $(0.1) million, respectively. For information about how we calculate Adjusted EBITDA, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. We expect to continue to 
 6

incur additional losses as we invest in the global expansion of our business. As of December 31, 2017, our accumulated deficit was $249.2 million.
We continue to develop and maintain an expanding portfolio of intellectual property, which included 436 issued patents globally and 210 pending patent applications globally as of December 31, 2017. In addition to our current product offerings, we continue to invest in the research and development necessary to design, develop and commercialize new surgical solutions for unmet clinical needs. Our highly efficient product development process utilizes an integrated design team approach that involves collaboration among leading surgeons in their respective specialties, our product management team, our engineers and our clinical and regulatory personnel. We believe that utilizing integrated design teams enables us to develop innovative and differentiated technologies and techniques that meet the needs of the market and allow surgeons and hospitals to better serve their patients. As of December 31, 2017, our product portfolio contains 99 product lines, which include our EVEREST, MESA and CASCADIA technologies, demonstrating our ability to leverage our product development process to rapidly innovate new products.
We currently market or sell our products in the United States and 40 other countries. In 2017, international sales represented approximately 23.5% of our revenue. For information regarding the Company’s revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area, see Note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have made significant investments in building a global hybrid sales organization consisting of direct sales employees, independent sales agencies and distributor partners. As of December 31, 2017, our U.S. sales organization consisted of 117 direct sales employees and 109 independent sales agencies and our international distribution network consisted of 41 direct sales employees, ten independent sales agencies and 25 independent distributors. We expect to continue to invest in the expansion of our global hybrid sales organization. We believe the continued expansion of our sales force will provide us with significant opportunities for future growth as we increase our penetration of existing geographic markets and enter new ones. We do not sell our products through or participate in PODs.
Industry Background
Overview of Spine Anatomy
The spine is the central core of the human skeleton and provides structural support, balance and flexibility to the body. It consists of 24 interlocking bones, called vertebrae, which are stacked on top of one another. The spine is comprised of five regions, of which there are three primary regions: cervical, thoracic and lumbar. There are seven vertebrae in the cervical, or neck, region of the spine, 12 vertebrae in the thoracic, or central, region of the spine, and five vertebrae in the lumbar, or lower back, which is the primary load-bearing region of the spine. The bottom of the spine, comprised of the sacrum and the coccyx, consists of naturally fused vertebrae connected to the hip bones to provide support for the spine. A healthy spine has a natural curvature when viewed from the side and is straight when viewed from the front or back. The cervical and lumbar regions contain forward convex curves referred to as lordosis while the thoracic region contains a backward concave curve referred to as kyphosis. Between each pair of vertebrae is an intervertebral disc that acts as a shock absorber during movement. Vertebrae are paired as motion segments, or levels, and are connected to each other by facet joints in the rear region of the spine that provide flexibility and enable the spine to bend and twist. The back, or posterior, part of each vertebra is comprised of a bony arch called the lamina and the spinous process. Soft tissues, including ligaments, tendons and muscles are attached to these structures, which provide stability to the spinal column and facilitate movement of the spine. The largest load bearing bony structure, which is in the front, or anterior, and middle part of each vertebra, is referred to as the vertebral body. These collective spinal elements serve as a protective cage for the spinal cord, which runs through the center of the spine, or spinal canal, carrying nerves that exit through openings between the vertebrae, or foramen, which run from every area of the body to the brain, delivering sensation and control to the entire body.
 7

Anatomical Planes of the Human Body
The human body, including the spine, is transected by three primary anatomical planes. The coronal plane divides the body into ventral (front) and dorsal (back) sections. The sagittal plane divides the body into left and right sections. The axial plane divides the body into superior (top) and inferior (bottom) sections. When taken collectively, these planes provide a 360 degree view of each segment of the spine. Each of these spine segments consist of vertebrae that move independently across these three planes. Movement of each of these segments is part of the complex, integrated spinal structure that serves to provide balance for the entire body.
Overview of Spine Disorders
Complex spine pathologies and back pain related to spine disorders are a leading driver of healthcare costs globally. Spine disorders range in severity from mild discomfort and numbness, to curvatures of the spine, extreme pain and paralysis. Spine disorders can be categorized as either complex, which consists of deformity (primarily scoliosis), trauma and tumor, or degenerative.
Spine deformity is any variation in the natural curvature of the spine. The most common form of spine deformity is scoliosis, which is either a lateral or side-to-side curvature of the spine, or an extreme rotation of the vertebral body. Other common types of deformity include hyperlordosis, which is an over-extension of the normal convex curvature of the cervical and lumbar spine, and hyperkyphosis, which is an over-flexion of the normal concave curvature of the thoracic spine.

Front | Side

Spine deformity can be further grouped into the following four categories, which are known to have different spine characteristics:

• | Pediatric infantile scoliosis, presents in children under 10 years of age as a result of conditions present at birth or congenital conditions;


• | Adolescent scoliosis, presents in patients between the ages of 10 and 18 as a result of congenital conditions, neuromuscular conditions such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy, or other unknown previously existing conditions;


• | Adult scoliosis, presents in patients between the ages of 19 and 64 as a result of scoliosis, which typically starts after the age of 40 due to arthritis or other conditions of aging, or as a result of scoliosis that started when the patient was younger; and


• | Aging spine, presents in patients 65 years of age or older as a result of a pre-existing deformity that has progressed or the onset of severe degenerative spine disorders.

Spine trauma is often the result of impact from a fall, car accident or other external forces. Spine traumas include fractures, dislocations, soft tissue damage and other musculoskeletal and nervous system injuries.
Spine tumors are relatively rare. Benign tumors are typically removed surgically while malignant tumors are more difficult to treat and often originate in other areas of the body such as the lungs, thyroid or kidneys.
Degenerative spine disorders are typically the result of repetitive stresses experienced during the normal aging process and are the most common type of spine disorders. Degenerative spine disorders occur when the intervertebral disc at a motion segment weakens and loses its normal height, thereby compressing the spinal nerves. Compression of the spinal nerves often leads to pain and/or loss of feeling in the arms, back and legs.
Treatment Alternatives for Degenerative Spine Disorders
Treatment for degenerative spine disorders usually begins with conservative therapies, including observation to determine if the spine disorder is progressing, lifestyle changes such as exercise and weight loss, anti-inflammatory and pain medication and physical therapy. If and when conservative therapies fail to provide adequate quality of life improvements, patients may ultimately require spine surgery.
The goals of spine surgery are to reduce patient pain and restore structural support by balancing the head over the pelvis over the lower extremities, while maintaining natural flexibility within the spine, if possible. Surgical options for degenerative spine disorders vary greatly depending on each patient’s unique pathology and include procedures that either 
 9

(1) do not use spinal implants or (2) use spinal implants. Decompression procedures are typically performed earlier in the continuum of care and may or may not include the use of spinal implants. These procedures include discectomies and laminectomies, which involve the removal of part of a damaged disc or lamina in order to relieve pressure on the spinal nerves. Decompression procedures may occasionally result in spinal instability due to the removal of these spinal elements and as a result require the utilization of spinal implants.
In the case of advanced degenerative spine disorders, treatment often turns to procedures that involve the use of spinal implants, the most common of which is a fusion procedure. The goal of fusion is to permanently decompress the spinal nerves exiting the spine by restoring the natural height of the disc and eliminating motion at the affected level. A fusion procedure involves the surgical removal of bone and/or diseased or damaged disc material that is believed to be the source of the pain and insertion of spinal implants to the spine to stabilize the affected vertebrae. Spinal implants used in fusion procedures include interbody devices that replace the disc space between the vertebrae, as well as spinal implants such as Rails, stabilization rods, screws, plates and biomaterials that provide stability and promote fusion between the vertebrae. Treatments for degenerative spine disorders may also include motion preservation technologies such as cervical and lumbar disc replacement, dynamic stabilization, annular closure, nucleus replacement and facet arthroplasty devices. In some instances, degenerative spine disorders may progress to complex spine disorders, depending on the severity and advancement of the pathology or structural deformity.
Treatment Alternatives for Complex Spine Disorders
Treatments for complex spine disorders, such as deformity, address patients with severe curves in their spine seeking to prevent curve progression and obtain curve correction. The treatment pathway for deformity cases may begin with bracing or casting which are designed to slow or correct the progression of the adverse curvature of the spine. Bracing and casting are typically used as the first course of treatment in young children who are still growing. If a child’s curve has shown progression despite bracing or casting, surgery is often considered. Surgical treatment for deformity conditions in young patients that have not stopped growing, such as pediatric infantile scoliosis, typically seek to correct the deformity while avoiding long fusions of the spine. These procedures include the use of spinal implants, such as pedicle screws and expandable rods that are periodically lengthened, to control the spine deformity while still allowing for the spine to grow until the child reaches an appropriate size or age for a more permanent solution, such as spinal fusion. When these patients mature and reach spinal maturity, spinal fusions are typically considered.
Treatment of more intricate complex spine disorders, such as traumas and tumors, may require the use of one or several procedural alternatives, such as (1) decompression, (2) fusion or (3) corpectomy techniques, where the vertebral body may be completely removed and replaced by a vertebral body replacement device.
The indications for surgical treatment of complex spine disorders such as deformity are determined by anatomical angle measurements that are established and well defined among hospitals, physicians and third-party payors. Conversely, fusion procedures for degenerative conditions are typically indicated when the source of the patient’s pain originates from the vertebral level in question and a diagnostic confirmation of degenerative disc disease is made. Current techniques to identify the source of a patient’s degenerative back pain are imprecise and it may be difficult to locate the source of pain. Third-party payors typically require a confirmed diagnosis of degenerative disc disease in order to reimburse for surgical procedures. We believe complex spine procedures typically receive a higher rate of positive insurance coverage and often generate more revenue per case, as compared to degenerative procedures.
MIS Treatment Alternatives for Complex and Degenerative Spine Disorders
Traditional approaches for complex spine and degenerative spine surgery require large incisions in order to provide surgeons with access to, and visibility of, the spine and surrounding areas. Consequently, traditional surgical procedures are considered highly invasive and are often associated with several limitations including significant blood loss, extensive soft tissue disruption, long operative times, extended hospital stays and lengthy patient recovery times.
Over time, there has been significant increase in surgeon and patient interest for less invasive surgical techniques for treating both complex and degenerative spine disorders. MIS techniques are designed to allow for less invasive access to the spine and, as a consequence, faster patient recovery times as compared to traditional open access surgical techniques. The figures below illustrate the different incision sizes in a multi-level deformity case utilizing both traditional open and MIS surgical techniques.
 10

Biomaterials Treatment Alternatives for Complex and Degenerative Spine Disorders
Biomaterial treatments are typically derived from human bone or synthetic sources and come in a variety of forms. These biomaterials are used by spine surgeons during the surgical treatment of certain complex spine and degenerative pathologies to augment spinal implants and to promote fusion by accelerating or substituting for the normal regenerative capacity of bone.
Market Opportunity
According to iData, the global spine surgery market was estimated at approximately $10.8 billion in 2017:

Overviews of the global spine markets in which we compete, and their associated growth drivers, are as follows:
Complex Spine
 11

The approximately $1.7 billion global complex spine market includes technologies and techniques used to treat cases of spine deformity, trauma and tumor, including those treated through a minimally invasive approach. While many advancements in the treatment of complex spine disorders have been made, considerable challenges and limitations associated with performing complex spine surgery remain. For example, many of the spinal implants and instruments currently used to perform complex spine surgeries are not designed to sufficiently address the variable and unpredictable nature of complex spine surgeries caused by the different sizes, shapes, densities and growth characteristics of each individual spine. It is not always possible for spine surgeons to anticipate which of these variables will be present in any given spine surgery, which may result in suboptimal patient outcomes and longer procedure times if they do not have the proper spinal implants and instruments readily available during the procedure. Further, many existing complex spine surgery implants, instruments and surgical approaches are not designed to concurrently access multiple levels of the spine through a MIS approach. 
We believe the global complex spine market has been underserved and underdeveloped by major spine market competitors, which generally focus on the larger degenerative spine market. As a result, we believe the complex spine patient population has and will continue to benefit from innovative technologies and techniques that enable simplified surgical procedures, MIS approaches and surgical treatment earlier in the continuum of care.
MIS
The approximately $1.5 billion global MIS market includes technologies and techniques used in treating degenerative spine disorders through minimally invasive approaches to the spine.
These technologies and techniques include MIS pedicle screws that are affixed to the spine through either percutaneous, or puncture-like, incisions or retractors that provide direct visualization of the spine with a smaller incision than traditional open procedures. The MIS market also includes minimally invasive interbody devices, including posterior, transforaminal and lateral lumbar interbody fusion (“LLIF”) devices. LLIF devices are inserted from the side and are associated with less disruption to the soft tissues of the back. We believe the vast majority of surgeons and patients, when given the option, will utilize MIS procedures rather than traditional open procedures due to the advantages of MIS approaches, which often include less soft tissue disruption, reduced frequency of surgical morbidity, faster operating times, reduced scarring and, as a consequence of these advantages, shorter patient recovery times. Finally, we believe the overall improvement to the standard of care resulting from the introduction of new MIS products will increase global demand for MIS technologies and techniques.
Degenerative Spine
The approximately $6.4 billion global degenerative spine market includes technologies and techniques used to treat degenerative spine disorders. These technologies and techniques include products such as cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal fusion devices, interbody devices, motion preservation technologies and vertebral compression fracture devices. We believe that several factors will continue to influence the growth in the global degenerative spine market, including aging patient demographics, increased life expectancies, the desire for maintaining and/or improving lifestyles and demand from patients and surgeons for innovative technologies and techniques that enable simplified surgical procedures, faster procedure times and improved clinical outcomes.

Balance ACS 
Balance ACS, or BACS, is a comprehensive platform of products, services and research that applies three-dimensional solutions across the full continuum of care to help facilitate quality outcomes for spine patients. BACS provides solutions focused on achieving balance of the spine by addressing each anatomical vertebral segment with a 360-degree approach of the axial, coronal and sagittal planes, emphasizing Total Body Balance as a critical component to surgical success. The BACS platform includes tools to assist surgeons with obtaining authorization from healthcare insurers prior to the surgery taking place (BACS Preauthorization), surgical planning (BACS Surgical Planning) and modeling (BACS Anatomical Models) and data management from intake to follow-up (BACS Data Management).
Product Pipeline
In addition to our comprehensive portfolio of commercialized products, we continue to develop innovative new technologies and techniques to bring to market. Our next generation product efforts will remain focused on the complex spine and MIS markets, as well as creating three-dimensional and BACS driven solutions across the entire episodic care continuum to help drive quality outcomes for spinal fusion patients.
To address complex adolescent and adult deformities, we will launch the YUKON OCT Spinal System and expand the roll-out of the PALO ALTO Cervical Corpectomy System.  
In the MIS market, we will continue the roll-out of the EVEREST MI XT Spinal System and the MOJAVE PL 3D Expandable Interbody System as well as expand our CASCADIA Lateral implant offerings, featuring Lamellar 3D Titanium Technology. 
In the degenerative market, we will offer new additions to our family of CASCADIA Interbody Systems. To further strengthen our position in the expandable market, including 3D-printed expandables, we will lever the portfolio of 17 issued and pending patents for expandable interbody technology we acquired through an exclusive license in July 2017. We believe this licensed intellectual property may provide our interbody product lines with expansion capabilities that exceed many expandable devices currently on the market. In addition, we will continue to collect data on the use of our RHINE Cervical Disc System, which we currently market and sell outside of the U.S., and monitor FDA regulations around such products so that we may evaluate the business conditions appropriate for introducing RHINE to the U.S. market.
Additionally, through our partnership with Brainlab, we expect to develop a full line of navigation-adapted instrument sets for our key product lines that are compatible with Brainlab navigation systems as we continue the expansion of our Balance ACS platform.
Research and Product Development
We have made significant investments in our product development capabilities to enhance our product lines and believe that ongoing research and development efforts are essential to our success. Our product design teams consist of surgeon advisors, product managers, engineers and clinical and regulatory personnel who work closely together in an integrated product development process to design, enhance and validate our technologies and techniques.
These product design teams conceptualize technologies and then build and test prototypes utilizing in-house and third- party prototyping and testing facilities. As part of the development process, spine surgeons evaluate the implantation of the product in our cadaveric laboratory to ensure it meets the needs of both surgeons and patients. Prototypes are then quickly refined or redesigned as necessary based on the results of the product testing, allowing us to perform rapid iterations of the design-prototype-test development cycle.
Our regulatory and clinical affairs personnel allow us to anticipate and resolve any potential issues at early stages in the development cycle. In addition, they are able to submit regulatory filings shortly after the final development testing has been completed and are committed to timely and responsive communication with regulatory agencies. We have demonstrated an ability to gain timely regulatory approvals of our technologies.
Our research and development expense was $22.2 million, $21.5 million and $19.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Global Spine Community Involvement, Education and Training
We devote significant resources towards global surgeon education on the proper use of our technologies and techniques. This education includes approved patient indications, contra-indications and overviews of the features and clinical benefits of our products. For example, we support local, regional, national and global educational courses, intensive hands-on cadaveric training and product-based programs that include didactic sessions coupled with hands-on-lab segments to allow 
 20

surgeons to learn and experience new technologies.
We believe that our success has been, and will continue to be, driven by the quality of our products and reputation within the spine surgeon community. We collaborate with spine surgeons in various aspects of our strategy and product development. These spine surgeons are compensated pursuant to written agreements with us. These agreements generally provide for compensation on an hourly-basis for time spent on our projects and may entitle such surgeons to royalties. We also work with surgeons and other healthcare professionals in the area of clinical research in order to gain a better understanding of the safety and efficacy of our products and support the necessary requirements for product clearances and registrations internationally.
As an active member of the global spine community, we support and maintain a presence in trade and industry organizations, including the Scoliosis Research Society and the Pediatric Orthopedic Society of North America, as well as other local, regional, national and international spine societies. At these meetings, we demonstrate the clinical benefits of our products to surgeons and generate awareness among these societies as to the clinical benefits of our innovative technologies and techniques.
We provide charitable support to the medical community and the community in general. We also provide financial and product support to international medical missions in underdeveloped countries around the world and to local community charitable causes.
Sales and Marketing
We promote, market and sell our products through a global hybrid sales organization comprised of direct sales employees, including complex spine and MIS product specialists, independent sales agencies and distributor partners. Our U.S. sales organization consists of 117 direct sales employees and 109 independent sales agencies. Each direct sales employee and independent sales agency is assigned a defined territory. 
Our international sales organization includes 41 direct sales employees, primarily located in the United Kingdom and Germany. In addition, we directly manage 10 independent sales agencies in Italy and Canada and sell to 25 distributors in certain other international markets. Combined, these international distribution efforts permit us to market and sell our products in 40 countries outside the United States. To support our international sales force, we deploy a number of international market managers who leverage product fluency and local market expertise to broaden and deepen our relationships with our independent agency and distributor partners as well as to provide a direct line of communication to our surgeon customers. Our international sales organization provides us with broad geographic coverage in regions where our products are sold, including the Americas, Europe, Middle East, South Africa and Asia/Pacific. We continually evaluate new market opportunities and expect to expand our international market presence. 
The contractual relationships with our independent sales agencies and distributor partners generally have terms of one to five years, with automatic renewal unless otherwise terminated. Our independent sales agencies are compensated based on a commission structure while our distributor partners purchase and take title to our products and resell them to their customers. These contractual arrangements may generally be terminated by us for failure to meet certain sales quotas or minimum purchase requirements or upon breach of the agreement by the counterparty. The nature of these contractual relationships vary, with certain contracts that are exclusive, some of which have limited exceptions to their exclusivity provisions, and others that are nonexclusive.
We support the efforts of both our direct sales employees and independent agency partners through the deployment of product specialists with expertise in complex spine and MIS. These specialists provide technical expertise relating to our products and engage surgeons and hospitals directly to assist them in better understanding product capabilities, value propositions and market trends.
We have also implemented certification programs designed to ensure a sophisticated proficiency within our global sales organization in the effective promotion, marketing and selling of our complex spine and MIS products, respectively. These certification programs include in-depth training on our products and promote a detailed proficiency in and understanding of the anatomical issues, clinical pathologies and diagnosis challenges associated with complex spine surgery and MIS technologies and techniques. We make decisions on whether to be direct or utilize independent sales agencies or distributor partners on a market-by-market basis using a number of parameters, including the availability of sales talent with the necessary level of spinal expertise, the reputation of the sales talent with surgeons and hospitals, the results of our compliance diligence and the overall potential of the market.
We continually evaluate and refine the performance of our global hybrid sales organization using a number of tools, including metric-driven scorecards and reviews of performance relative to budgets. Our direct sales force is compensated 
 21

through a combination of base salaries, individual and company-based performance bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation. Our independent sales agencies are compensated with commissions and individual-based performance bonuses. Our compensation programs are designed to balance rewarding performance, incentivizing the desired sales behaviors to align with our corporate strategy and maximizing sales force retention.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
We have a strong base of more than 50 third-party suppliers located primarily in the United States, with a small number located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), that manufacture our products. We work with these suppliers in support of our supply chain strategy, which involves minimizing our capital investment, controlling costs and shortening cycle times. We believe this allows us to compete with larger volume manufacturers of spine surgery products. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure our inventory needs are met while maintaining high quality and reliability.
We select our suppliers carefully. Our internal quality assurance and supply chain groups conduct on-site audits of our suppliers. As suppliers meet our internal quality control standards they are added to our approved supplier list. We regularly audit our suppliers to ensure they meet FDA, International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) and other country-specific requirements as necessary. In addition, suppliers of our biomaterials products are certified by the American Association of Tissue Banks (“AATB”). Our quality assurance and supply chain groups conduct annual audits to ensure continued compliance with our standards; our suppliers provide a certificate of compliance with every shipment of inventory that we receive in conformance with our quality control standards. Our quality control group also performs incoming inspection of our products, in-process inspections and packaging and labeling inspections on-site at our headquarters facility.
We generally do not have long-term supply contracts with our suppliers and they are not required to provide us with any guaranteed minimum production levels. In most cases, we maintain redundant manufacturing capabilities for each of our products to ensure our inventory needs are met. In January 2017, we entered into a long-term strategic partnership with 3D Systems to broaden our relationship in order to secure certain production commitments, create additional innovative 3D-printed interbodies and explore new opportunities in patient-specific implants. We do, however, have single or limited source contracts with certain suppliers who provide our biomaterials and materials for select interbody products.
We believe our supplier relationships will be able to support our potential capacity needs for the foreseeable future. To date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty locating and obtaining the suppliers or materials necessary to fulfill our production requirements.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. We proactively protect our innovations by filing U.S. and foreign patent applications, and our growing intellectual property portfolio reflects significant investment. We have also acquired intellectual property rights via the strategic purchase and license of patents from third parties to complement our internally-developed intellectual property holdings. We utilize specialist intellectual property lawyers to oversee our intellectual property assets. As of December 31, 2017, we owned or licensed 305 issued U.S. patents and 250 issued foreign patents and had 109 pending U.S. patent applications and 125 pending foreign patent applications. As of December 31, 2017, we also had 34 U.S. trademark registrations, 82 foreign trademark registrations, 7 pending U.S. applications and 36 foreign applications to register trademarks.
We license certain technologies used in our MESA products from Spinal LLC pursuant to an exclusive license agreement, which provides us with an exclusive license to the MESA technology and related patents and patent applications to treat diseases of or injuries to the spine until the expiration of all patents licensed pursuant to the agreement, which is expected to be in February 2024 for the material patents currently licensed under this agreement. Under this license agreement, we are required to make royalty payments equal to 6.0% of the net sales of our products that incorporate the MESA technology, subject to an annual minimum royalty payment of $0.4 million.
In addition, we license our tifix one-step locking technology from Dr. Dietmar Wolter pursuant to a license agreement, which provides us with an exclusive license to use such technology in the field of spinal surgery in the United States and a non-exclusive license to use such technology internationally until the expiration of all patents licensed pursuant to the agreement, which is expected to be in December 2019. Under the terms of this license agreement, we are required to make payments equal to 9.0% of net sales of products that incorporate tifix technology.
In 2017, we entered into an agreement to license certain proprietary technology related to 17 issued patents and pending patent applications for expandable interbody technology which could require us to make an additional payment of $3.0 million 
 22

following regulatory approval in the U.S.  Under the terms of this license agreement, we are required to make payments equal to 3.0% of net sales of products that are covered by a licensed patent until the expiration of the last to expire licensed patent that covers such product, which is expected to be in approximately 2033.
In 2011, we acquired certain proprietary spinal disc implant technologies that were developed and used in our RHINE Cervical Disc System, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, which could require additional payments up to $12.0 million if certain milestones are met related to U.S. regulatory applications and approvals as of December 31, 2017. In addition, milestone payments of $0.5 million, $2.0 million and $4.0 million are due upon the achievement of net sales from products incorporating such proprietary technologies of $10.0 million, $25.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively. We are also required to make royalty payments equal to 7.0% of net sales from patented products, up to an aggregate amount of $20.0 million.
In 2010, we acquired all rights to certain technologies used in our EVEREST pedicle screw system from Dr. John Carbone, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, which requires us to make payments to Dr. Carbone equal to 3.5% of the net sales from EVEREST pedicle screws and 1.5% of the net sales from any of our other products that incorporate certain elements of our EVEREST screw technology until the expiration of the last to expire U.S. patent related to such technologies, which is expected to be in August 2031, or, if no U.S. patent issues, for 10 years from product launch, except that we will have no obligation to make such payments on any sales of products made after February 23, 2031.
In 2007, we acquired all rights to certain technologies used in our SERENGETI retractor system from Dr. Josef Gorek, which requires us to make royalty payments equal to 3.0% of net sales from products that incorporate the SERENGETI retractor technology, subject to a minimum annual royalty of the greater of (1) $25 for each retractor sold or used in surgery or (2) $178,375. If we market a non-disposable reusable product incorporating the SERENGETI retractor technology, we will pay to Dr. Gorek a royalty of $25 for each use of such reusable product to place a screw implant in surgery, with a minimum royalty of $100 per surgery in which such reusable product is used. We are required to make such royalty payments on the net sales of any such product until the expiration of the last to expire U.S. patent used in the SERENGETI retractor, which is expected to be in May 2029. In the event we fail to pay the minimum royalties, and do not cure such non-payment after receiving notice of such non-payment, Dr. Gorek would have the right to have one partner other than us for the assigned intellectual property.
In 2004, we acquired all rights to certain technologies used in our DENALI pedicle screw system from Fastenetix LLC and certain other persons, pursuant to an assignment agreement, which requires us to make payments to the assignors equal to 6.0% of net sales of products that incorporate our DENALI screw technology that are covered by an issued patent or described in a patent application assigned to us under this agreement until the expiration of the last to expire patent related to such technologies, which occurred in February 2017, and 2.0% to 3.0% of such net sales thereafter. We are also obligated to make payments to the assignors on a product-by-product basis equal to 4.0% of net sales of products that incorporate our DENALI screw technology and that are covered by intellectual property assigned to us under this agreement other than patents and patent applications until either the expiration of the last to expire issued patent relating to such intellectual property or the abandonment of all patent applications relating to such intellectual property, and 2.0% to 3.0% of such net sales thereafter. The Fastenetix parties may have the right to re-purchase the contributed intellectual property in the event we cease operations (other than due to a sale or merger) or we enter into bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings.
We also rely upon trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights in trade secrets and know-how through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants, and others who may have access to our proprietary information.
Although we believe our patents are valuable, we also believe that our knowledge and experience and our trade secret information with respect to development and manufacturing processes, materials and product design have been equally important in maintaining our proprietary product lines. As a condition of employment, we generally require employees to execute a confidentiality agreement relating to proprietary information and assignment of patents and other intellectual property to us.
Seasonality
Our revenue is typically higher in the late spring and summer and in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, driven by higher sales of our complex spine products, which is influenced by the higher incidence of adolescent surgeries during these periods to coincide with the beginning of summer vacation and holiday periods.  In addition, due to seasonal changes in mortality rates, some scarce tissues used in our biomaterials products may be, at times, in particularly short supply.
Competition
 23

Our currently marketed products are, and any future products we commercialize will be, subject to intense competition. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are:

• | the quality of outcomes for medical conditions affecting the spine;


• | acceptance by spine surgeons;


• | ease of use and reliability;


• | technical leadership and superiority;


• | effective marketing and distribution;


• | speed to market; and


• | product price and qualification for coverage and reimbursement.

We also compete in the marketplace to recruit and retain qualified engineering, scientific, sales and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our business.
We are aware of several companies that compete against us or are developing technologies in our current and future product areas. As a result, we expect competition to remain intense. We believe that our principal competitors include Medtronic Public Limited Company, DePuy Synthes Inc., Stryker Corporation, Globus Medical, Inc., Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. and NuVasive Inc., which together represent a significant portion of the spine market. We also compete with smaller spine market participants such as Alphatec Holdings, Inc., Orthofix International N.V. and SeaSpine Holdings Corporation who generally have a smaller market share than the principal competitors listed above.
Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner, receive adequate coverage and reimbursement, are cost effective and are safe and effective.
Government Regulation
Our products primarily consist of medical devices and tissues and are, therefore, subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (“FDCA”), the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) and the regulations promulgated under both statutes, as well as by other domestic and international regulatory bodies. These regulations govern the following activities that we and our suppliers, licensors and partners perform and will continue to perform:

• | product design and development;


• | product testing;


• | product manufacturing;


• | product labeling;


• | product storage;


• | product safety;


• | premarket clearance or approval;


• | advertising and promotion;


• | product marketing, sales and distribution;


• | post-market surveillance; and


• | post-market adverse event reporting.

Regulatory Clearances and Approvals
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we wish to commercially distribute in the United States will require prior 510(k) clearance or approval of a Pre-Market Approval Application (“PMA”) from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose a low or moderate risk are placed in class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) premarket notification requesting clearance for commercial distribution, unless the device type is exempt from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life supporting or implantable devices or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device are placed in class III, requiring submission and approval of a PMA. Both premarket clearance and approval submissions are subject to user fees, which must be paid at the time of submission for FDA review.
To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of PMAs. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the notification is submitted, but it can take considerably longer, depending on the extent of FDA's requests for additional information and the amount of time a sponsor takes to fulfill them. FDA requests for additional information can include clinical data that the FDA determines is necessary to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
All of our commercial medical device products distributed in the U.S. to date have been classified as either class I or class II devices and have been cleared for marketing and distribution through the 510(k) pathway, unless exempt.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require premarket approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this decision initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new premarket clearance, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval is obtained. We have made, and plan to continue to make, product enhancements that we believe do not require new 510(k) clearances. However, if the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or premarket approval for any such modifications to previously cleared products, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval, and we could be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
A PMA must be submitted if a device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) clearance process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical information, preclinical data, clinical trial data, manufacturing data and labeling, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use.
Once a complete PMA application is submitted, the FDA begins an in-depth review which generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during this review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with quality system regulations. New PMA applications or supplements are required prior to marketing for product modifications that affect the safety and efficacy of the device. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support the changes to the device and may not require extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
None of our existing products are currently approved under a PMA. In the future, we may decide to strategically commercialize products in the U.S. that would require a PMA but we have no plans to do so at the present time.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification. In the United States, these trials often require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption, or IDE, if the investigation involves a significant risk device. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and is eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for a 
 25

significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical trial sites.
Future clinical trials of certain types of products will most likely require that we obtain an IDE from the FDA prior to commencing clinical trials and that the trial be conducted under the oversight of IRBs at the clinical trial sites. We conduct clinical trials in accordance with FDA regulations and similar federal and state regulations concerning human subject protection, including requirements for informed consent, healthcare privacy and financial disclosures by the clinical investigators. The receipt of personal information in connection with our clinical trial initiatives is subject to these human subject protection laws. These laws could create liability for us if one of our research collaborators were to use or disclose research subject information without proper consent or in violation of applicable laws. Even if a study is completed, the results of our clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, or may be equivocal or otherwise not be sufficient to obtain clearance or approval of our products. Similarly, in the EEA, conduct of clinical studies in relation to investigational medical devices is governed by detailed regulatory obligations. These include the requirement for prior authorization by the competent authorities of the country in which the study takes place and the requirement to obtain a positive opinion from a competent Ethics Committee.
Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
After a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

• | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;


• | quality system regulations, which require manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, process control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures;


• | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved, i.e. “off-label,” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; 


• | medical device reporting, “MDR” regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;


• | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;


• | requirements to conduct post-market surveillance studies to establish continued safety data, and other post-approval conditions; and


• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations.

We are required to, and have, registered with the FDA and ISO as medical device manufacturers and must obtain all necessary permits and licenses to operate our business. As manufacturers, we and our suppliers are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and European Notified Bodies to determine our compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulations. The FDA has inspected our Leesburg facilities on several separate occasions from 2006 through 2017. All of those inspections are closed and none have resulted in the initiation of an FDA enforcement action or issuance of a Warning Letter.
Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include, among other things, any of the following sanctions:

• | warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;


• | repair, replacement, refund or seizure of our products;


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;


• | refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or modifications to

 26

existing products;

• | withdrawing or suspending clearances or approvals that are already granted; and


• | criminal prosecution.

International Regulations
Many foreign countries in which we market or intend to market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions, similar to those of the FDA. International sales are subject to foreign government regulation, the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in a foreign country or a CE Certificate of Conformity may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the related requirements may differ. Some third-world countries accept CE Certificates of Conformity or FDA clearance or approval as part of applications of approval for marketing of medical devices in their territory. Other countries, including Australia, Japan and Canada require separate regulatory filings.
In the EEA, companies compliant with ISO requirements such as the EN ISO 13485: 2016 "Medical devices-Quality management systems-Requirements for regulatory purposes," benefit from a presumption of conformity with the relevant quality system requirements laid down in the Annexes to the Medical Devices Directive. This certification process requires that the Company’s quality management system and facilities be inspected by a Notified Body for compliance with ISO requirements. Compliance with the ISO requirements can also facilitate market access in other jurisdictions.
We received ISO 13485 certification in November 2007, and we affix the CE Mark to our products concurrently with the 510(k) process in the U.S. We cannot assure that we or our original equipment manufacturer partners will be able to continue to obtain the necessary foreign government approvals or successfully comply with foreign regulations. Our failure to do so could hurt our business, results of operations and financial condition.
European Economic Area
In the EEA, our devices are required to comply with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive. Compliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the CE mark to our medical devices. We cannot commercialize our medical devices in the EEA without the CE Mark. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive and obtain the right to affix the CE mark to our medical devices, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. The Medical Devices Directive groups medical devices into four product classes. These classes and related rules are based on the potential risks associated with the technical design and manufacture of the medical devices that fall within their classification. The classification rules make a distinction between non-invasive, invasive, and active medical devices. A number of additional rules govern specific medical devices, such as those incorporating an ancillary medicinal substance. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements laid down in the Medical Devices.
A conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization designated by the competent authorities of a European Union (“EU”) country to conduct conformity assessments.
Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would typically audit and examine products’ Technical File and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices before issuing a CE Certificate of Conformity demonstrating compliance with the relevant Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the Essential Requirements. This Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity. We have now successfully passed annual Notified Body audits since our original certification in November 2007. Following these audits, our Notified Body issued ISO certificates and CE Certificates of Conformity allowing us to draw up an EC Declaration of Conformity and affix the CE mark of conformity to certain of our devices. 
In September 2012, the European Commission adopted a package of legislative proposals designed to replace the existing regulatory framework for medical devices in the EEA. Among these proposals, the Medical Devices Regulation (“MD Regulation”) will replace the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. 
In May 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation or MDR (Regulation 2017/745) was adopted. The MDR repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be 
 27

implemented into the national laws of the EU Member States, the MDR will be directly applicable in the EU Member States and on the basis of the EEA agreement in Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. The MDR, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The MDR will apply beginning May 26, 2020. Once applicable, the MDR will among other things:

• | strengthen the clinical data requirements related to medical devices;


• | impose additional scrutiny during the conformity assessment procedure for high risk medical devices;


• | impose on manufacturers and authorized representatives the obligation to have a person responsible for regulatory compliance continuously at their disposal;


• | require that authorized representatives be held legally responsible and liable for defective products placed on the EEA market jointly with the device manufacturers;


• | reinforce post-market surveillance requirements applicable to CE marked medical devices;


• | improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a Unique Device Identification (“UDI”) System; and


• | increase transparency through the establishment of EUDAMED III. Information from several databases concerning economic operators, CE Certificates of Conformity, conformity assessment, clinical investigations, the UDI system, adverse event reporting and market surveillance will be available to the public.

Once applicable, the MDR will impose increased compliance obligations for us to access the EU market. Moreover, as a result of application of the MDR, certain spinal devices will be reclassified from Class IIb to Class III. Rule 8 of Annex VIII to the MD Regulation states that all implantable devices and long-term surgically invasive devices are classified as Class IIb unless they “are spinal disc replacement implants and implantable devices that come into contact with the spinal column, in which case they are in Class III with the exception of components such as screws, wedges, plates and instruments.” For us, this means rods, hooks, connectors, cervical discs, and corpectomy cages will be reclassified to Class III and will be subject to stricter requirements in accordance with the MDR.
The scrutiny imposed by notified bodies for the technical documentation related these devices will increase considerably. Some differences between requirements for Class IIb and Class III devices are summarized below:

• | Class III devices undergo an additional technical documentation assessment following which the Notified Bodies issue a technical documentation assessment certificate;


• | increased strength of requirement for clinical investigation and evaluation;


• | a summary of safety and clinical performance must be prepared by manufacturers for publication on the EUDAMED database for medical devices;


• | review for Class III devices is not a sampling process, unlike for Class IIa and Class IIb devices which is done on a sampling basis; and


• | notified Bodies shall notify the Commission and the newly created Medical Device Coordination Group (“MDCG”) of new applications for Class III devices as part of a mandatory clinical evaluation consultation procedure.

Further, the advertising and promotion of our products in the EEA is subject to the provisions of the Medical Devices Directive, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other national legislation in the EEA countries governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
Tissue, Cellular and Tissue Based Products
 28

Tissue-only products are regulated by the FDA as Human Cell, Tissue and Cellular and Tissue Based Products, or HCT/P. In regards to HCT/P, we are registered with FDA and subject to the regulations related only to labeling, packaging, storage and distribution. 
Human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient is regulated as a HCT/P. In the United States the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) regulates HCT/Ps under 21 CFR Part 1270 and CFR Part 1271. Parts 1270 and 1271 require tissue establishments to screen and test donors, to prepare and follow written procedures for the prevention of the spread of communicable disease, and to maintain records. FDA has published three final rules to broaden the scope of products subject to regulation and to include more comprehensive requirements to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. One final rule requires firms to register and list their HCT/Ps with FDA. The second rule requires tissue establishments to evaluate donors, through screening and testing, to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases through tissue transplantation. The third rule establishes current good tissue practices for HCT/Ps. FDA’s revised regulations are contained in Part 1271 and apply to tissues recovered after May 25, 2005. The new requirements are intended to improve protection of the public health while minimizing regulatory burden.
We currently distribute VIKOS machined allograft and VESUVIUS morselized products, which are manufactured by a third-party supplier. The FDA periodically inspects tissue processors to determine compliance with these requirements. Violations of applicable regulations noted by the FDA during facility inspections could adversely affect the continued marketing of our products. We believe we comply with all aspects of the current good tissue practices, although there can be no assurance that we will comply, or will comply on a timely basis, in the future. Entities that provide us with allograft bone tissue are responsible for performing donor recovery, donor screening and donor testing and our compliance with those aspects of the current good tissue practices regulations that regulate those functions are dependent upon the actions of these independent entities.
The procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue is subject to U.S. federal law pursuant to the National Organ Transplant Act, or NOTA, a criminal statute which prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs used in human transplantation, including bone and related tissue, for “valuable consideration.” NOTA permits reasonable payments associated with the removal, transportation, processing, preservation, quality control, implantation and storage of human bone tissue. With the exception of removal and implantation, we provide services in all of these areas. We make payments to vendors in consideration for the services they provide in connection with the recovery and screening of donors. Failure to comply with the requirements of NOTA could result in enforcement action against us. The procurement of human tissue is also subject to state anatomical gift acts and some states have statutes similar to NOTA. In addition, some states require that tissue processors be licensed by that state. Failure to comply with state laws could also result in enforcement action against us.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse
Healthcare providers, physicians and others often play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of medical devices and other products reimbursed by federal healthcare programs. Manufacturers of these products are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which manufacturers market, sell and distribute the products for which they obtain marketing approval. Companies operating in the health industry must comply with these laws, which have criminal, civil and administrative penalties for potential violations. Some of the laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate are described below.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs, such as by Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, and the government can establish a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute without proving that a person or entity had actual knowledge of the law or specific intent to violate it. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations and has been applied by government enforcement officials to a number of common business arrangements in the medical device industry. For example, the federal government has enforced the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with device manufacturers based on allegedly sham consultant arrangements with physicians. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, however, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute, but the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on the totality of the facts and circumstances.
 29

The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment of federal funds, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the federal False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a private citizen action (known as qui tams) brought by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the federal False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare companies throughout the country for a wide variety of Medicare billing practices, as well as federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, and has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the federal False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, a claim to a federal healthcare program that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and suppliers’ compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws.
The federal False Claims Act amendments in 2009 and 2010 expanded the scope of the liability for healthcare entities generally to potentially reach violations of regulatory duties, such as good manufacturing practices. There have been large settlements in the life sciences arena related to FDA regulatory violations related to promotional activities and the failure to maintain good manufacturing practices.
Even in instances where a company may have no actual liability, the federal False Claims Act private citizen provisions (qui tam) allow the filing of federal False Claims Act actions under seal and impose a mandatory duty on the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate such allegations. Most private citizen actions are declined by the Department of Justice or dismissed by federal courts. However, the investigation costs for a company can be significant and material even if the allegations are without merit.
Federal False Claims Act liability is potentially significant because the statute provides for treble damages and penalties of $11,181 to $22,363 per false claim or statement. Because of the potential for large monetary exposure, healthcare companies often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages that may awarded in litigation proceedings. Enforcement agencies often require companies to enter into burdensome Corporate Integrity Agreements or Deferred Prosecution Agreements as a condition of such settlements. Healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claim laws, including laws that impose criminal penalties for making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually (with certain exceptions) to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and payments or other “transfers of value” to such physician owners. 
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal laws described above, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws. These state laws apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. In addition, a number of states require medical device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of their products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in the states. Other states restrict when medical device companies may provide meals to healthcare providers or engage in other marketing related activities, or require such companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct. Outside the U.S., we are subject to similar regulations in those countries where we market and sell products.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives and intermediaries from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, 
 30

political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations. Efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly for manufacturers of medical devices and other healthcare products. If a manufacturer's operations, including activities conducted by its sales team, are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to the company, the company may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, including imprisonment, monetary penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations.
If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with any of these applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties, including damages, fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs.
Healthcare Reform
The regulations we are subject to may change as result of legislative and regulatory healthcare reform.
Significant healthcare reform was enacted in 2010 when the PPACA was signed into law. State laws also were enacted to implement the PPACA. While a primary goal of these healthcare reform efforts was to expand coverage to more individuals, it also involved increased government price controls, additional regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs. The PPACA significantly impacts the medical device industry. Among other things, the PPACA:

• | imposes an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, which began on January 1, 2013 (described in more detail below), but was suspended during 2016 and 2017 and has been suspended for 2018 and 2019;


• | establishes a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research; and


• | implements payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, on January 2, 2013, former President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Moreover, certain legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the PPACA have occurred in the 115th United States Congress and under the Trump Administration. For example, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed a budget reconciliation act into law, which among other things, repealed the penalty for individuals who do not maintain minimum essential coverage, which was a central component of PPACA’s approach to expanding coverage. On January 9, 2018, President Trump signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which, among other things, repealed the PPACA provision establishing an independent payment advisory board that would have submitted recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeded a specified growth rate.
Additional legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the PPACA remain possible. We expect that other state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could reduce the number of patients with coverage or limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
Reimbursement Overview
Healthcare providers in the United States generally rely on third-party payors, principally private insurers and governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of a spine surgery in which our products are used. We expect that sales volumes and prices of our products will continue to depend in large part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from such third-party payors. Third-party payors perform analyses on new technologies to determine if they are medically necessary before providing coverage for them. These third-party payors may still deny reimbursement on covered technologies if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with the payor’s coverage policy. Particularly in the United States, third-party payors continue to carefully 
 31

review, and increasingly challenge, the prices charged for surgical procedures and medical products.
Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies are developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and its contractors. CMS establishes Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies for medical products and procedures and these policies are periodically reviewed and updated. In 2018, we believe CMS will continue to pilot “bundled payments” as will the private payers. The payers are committed to transitioning from quantity reimbursement to reimbursing and incentivizing based on quality and improved outcomes. The private payers are responding to the needs of their customers and are jumping ahead of the CMS bundled payment program with their own, characterized by more predicable medical costs and better quality of care for their employees. While private payors vary in their coverage and payment policies, most look upon the coverage and payment by Medicare as a benchmark by which to make their own coverage decisions. Medicare reimbursement rates for the same or similar procedures vary due to geographic location, nature of the facility in which the procedure is performed (i.e., teaching or community hospital) and other factors.
In the United States, a large percentage of insured individuals receive their medical care through managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. Some managed care programs pay their providers on a per capita basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying these providers a predetermined payment per member per month and, consequently, may limit the willingness of these providers to use our products.
The indications for surgical treatment of complex spine disorders such as deformity are defined by anatomical angle measurements that are established and well defined among hospitals, physicians and third-party payors. Conversely, fusion procedures for degenerative conditions are typically indicated when the source of the patient’s pain originates from the vertebral level in question and a diagnostic confirmation of degenerative disc disease is made. Current techniques to identify the source of a patient’s degenerative back pain are imprecise and it may be difficult to locate the source of pain. Third-party payors typically require a confirmed diagnosis of degenerative disc disease in order to reimburse for surgical procedures. We believe complex spine procedures typically receive a higher rate of positive insurance coverage as compared to degenerative procedures.
We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of its products and services. We cannot assure you that government or private third-party payors will cover and reimburse the procedures using our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate. In addition, it is possible that future legislation, regulation or coverage and reimbursement policies of third-party payors will adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell them on a profitable basis.
Internationally, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary substantially by country and include single-payor and government-managed systems as well as systems in which private payors and government managed systems exist side-by-side. Our ability to achieve market acceptance or significant sales volume in international markets we enter will be dependent in large part on the availability of reimbursement for procedures performed using our products under the healthcare payment systems in such markets. A number of countries may require us to gather additional clinical data before recognizing coverage and reimbursement for our products. It is our intent to complete the requisite clinical studies and obtain coverage and reimbursement approval in countries where it makes economic sense to do so.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 484 employees in the United States, including the territory of Puerto Rico. Internationally, we had 76 employees based in eight countries, with international offices located in the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. 
Our employees are not unionized and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
