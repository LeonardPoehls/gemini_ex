ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
Finjan Holdings, Inc. (the “Company” or “Finjan Holdings”) is a cybersecurity company focused in four business lines; intellectual property licensing and enforcement, mobile security application development, advisory services, and investing in cybersecurity technologies and intellectual property.  Licensing and enforcement of the Company's cybersecurity patent portfolio is operated by its wholly-owned subsidiary Finjan, Inc. (“Finjan”). Finjan became a wholly owned subsidiary of Finjan Holdings in June of 2013 after a merger transaction, following which we began trading on the OTC Markets. Our common stock has been trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market ("NASDAQ") since May 2014. Since the merger, the Company continues to execute on its existing business lines while outlining a vision and focusing on growth. 
Founded in 1997, Finjan developed software and hardware-based web and network security technologies capable of detecting previously unknown and emerging threats on a real-time, behavior-based, basis, in contrast to signature-based methods of intercepting only known threats to computers. The older, signature-based methods were standard in the web and network security industry during the 1990s. Finjan invested heavily in both research and development of its technologies and in protecting its innovations by securing patents covering them.  As the web and endpoint security industries - known as cybersecurity - have transitioned to behavior-based detection of malicious code, we believe that our patented technologies continue to be widely used, without license, by third parties in a number of market segments.
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we generated revenue from our cybersecurity business of approximately $18.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively.
We recognized other income of approximately $0 and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The income during 2015 primarily derived from our investment in cybersecurity technologies.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, our net income was approximately $0.3 million, compared to a net loss of $12.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.
As used in this Annual Report, references to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” are used to refer collectively to Finjan Holdings, Inc. and it subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or the context requires.
Finjan Holdings Corporate Operating History
Finjan, Inc., our subsidiary, was founded in 1997 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Finjan Software Ltd (“FSL”), an Israeli corporation, to cultivate proprietary technologies that focused on proactively detecting threats to web and network traffic by identifying patterns and behavior of web and network viruses and other malicious code, rather than relying on lists of threats known within the web and network security industry. These technologies proactively scan and repel the latest, and often unknown, threats to network, web, and endpoint devices on a real-time basis.  Following the development of its patented technologies, FSL, together with its subsidiaries, provided secure web gateway solutions, including software and hardware, to the enterprise and endpoint markets both directly and through technology partners and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs").
In 2002, FSL engaged in a reorganization in which Finjan Software, Inc. (“FSI”), a Delaware corporation, was formed to acquire and hold all of the capital stock of Finjan. Between 2002 and 2009, FSI focused its efforts on research and development and sales and marketing activities in an effort to bolster its position in the security industry and enhance its platform of web and network inspection technologies. Throughout that time period, FSI’s activities were funded primarily by venture capital and private equity firms with experience providing capital and management expertise to software security firms, some with investment and operational experience within Israel’s cybersecurity and technology sectors. Finjan also received financial backing from multi-national software and technology companies.
Between approximately 2002 and 2006, competitors in the web and network security industry began moving towards real-time, behavior-based, proactive threat detection, at times in violation of Finjan’s patent rights. As a result, and beginning in 2005, Finjan commenced its licensing program around its patents. The first license, issued in 2005, was to Microsoft. In 2006, Finjan also initiated its first patent infringement litigation against a third party it believed was infringing its patents.

In October 2009, FSI transferred its portfolio of intellectual property to Finjan (its wholly-owned subsidiary at the time). Thereafter, in November 2009, FSI sold certain assets, including certain of its operating subsidiaries, not including Finjan, and its sales and marketing assets to M86 Security ("M86").  Finjan also granted a fully-paid, non-exclusive patent license to M86, in consideration for which M86 issued shares of its common stock to Finjan and FSI.  In connection with that transaction, and subsequent to November 2009, FSI and its remaining subsidiaries (including Finjan) ceased the development, manufacture, marketing and sale of its products, as well as research conducted through its Malicious Code Research Center as part of a confidential non-compete provision.  Finjan retained ownership of its patents and all related rights.  In March 2012, M86 merged with Trustwave Holdings, Inc. ("Trustwave") through which M86’s license from Finjan was renewed with Trustwave to include an expanded scope and an extension of the aforementioned non-compete for the development of software and hardware security products. In September 2015, Trustwave was acquired by Singapore Telecom ("SingTel").
Following the M86 and related transactions, and during an intervening period between 2009 and 2013, Finjan's existing investors financed its activities, which consisted primarily of enforcing its intellectual property in the security sector while the non-compete provision with M86 and Trustwave was in place.
Finjan Holdings (formerly, Converted Organics Inc.) was incorporated in Delaware in January of 2006 and in February 2007, we successfully completed an initial public offering. Finjan became a wholly owned subsidiary of Finjan Holdings in June of 2013 after a merger transaction, following which we began trading on the OTC Markets under the ticker COIN. Our common stock has been trading on NASDAQ since May 2014 under the ticker FNJN.
In April 2013, Finjan distributed all securities it held in two unaffiliated entities to FSI, and made a payment of cash in an amount sufficient to repay and satisfy in full a pre-existing intercompany loan from FSI to Finjan. Following that distribution, the board of directors and stockholders of FSI approved the dissolution of, and a plan of liquidation for FSI that resulted in, among other things, the distribution of Finjan common stock to certain of FSI’s stockholders.
In June 2013, Finjan became a public company through a merger transaction described under “Corporate Information and History—Corporate History (Finjan Holdings, Inc.) prior to June 2013” and became one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Following the merger transaction, we immediately renamed the public company to Finjan Holdings, Inc. The newly renamed Finjan Holdings, Inc. was capitalized again with more than $30 million in cash from its previous investors who, at the time of the listing on NASDAQ, owned approximately 91.5% of the Company’s public equity. Finjan’s shareholders outlined a vision as a public company to continue the licensing and enforcement of Finjan’s patented technologies as well as continuing to invest in new cybersecurity technologies and services. 
In November 2013, Finjan Holdings made its first investment into an innovation fund focused on new cybersecurity technologies. The Company committed $5 million as a strategic limited partner to a fund managed by Jerusalem Venture Partners ("JVP"). JVP’s newly created Cyber Strategic Partners Fund VII was co-invested by the Company and three other multi-national companies. To date, there are eleven portfolio investments made through the JVP fund and the Company has already received distributions from its investment with JVP as two of the portfolio companies exited through an acquisition in 2015 and 2016. 
In March 2015, the non-compete and confidentiality provisions related to the M86 and Trustwave transactions expired. Within three months the Company had announced it was launching an advisory services business and entering mobile security development. Today the Company operates its advisory services business through its subsidiary CybeRisk Security Solutions, Ltd ("CybeRisk") and its mobile security business through its subsidiary Finjan Mobile, Inc. ("Finjan Mobile"). CybeRisk was founded in 2015 to deliver global advanced cyber risk and cyber security advisory services. Through a team of employees and consultants, headquartered in East Palo Alto, with offices in Tel Aviv, CybeRisk assesses corporate risk exposure and delivers appropriate mitigation strategies. Finjan Mobile fortifies mobile devices against spies, phishing and malware attacks.

Licensing and Enforcement – Licensing Best Practices
Under U.S. patent law, a patent owner has the right to exclude others from making, selling or using the owner’s patented technology without a license to do so. Through Finjan, we generate revenues and related cash flows by granting intellectual property licenses for the use of patented technologies that we own. We actively license and enforce our patent rights against unauthorized use of our patented technologies (i.e. potential infringers). Many of our license agreements, whether entered into via negotiated transactions (i.e. licensing transactions) or through a settlement or court ordered judgment (i.e. litigation action) or otherwise, are structured on a fully paid-up basis (often referred to as a “global peace license”). For such licenses, we generally agree to a lump sum license fee to be paid upon entering into the license or in accordance with a mutually agreed installment schedule. Some of our license agreements, however, provide for future royalty payments in the event the licensee achieves certain milestones specified in the applicable license agreement.  Our license agreements largely contemplate recovery of fees for sales made prior to the 
 5

effective date of the license, as well as for future sales through a defined termination date, in an amount related to the royalties we would have received had a license been in effect at the time of such sales.
How we conduct our licensing programs and enforcement actions is generally guided by our “Licensing Best Practices,” which we adopted in March 2014 to demonstrate our commitment to ethical, transparent and consistent business practices for intellectual property licensing. These Licensing Best Practices are based on the Company’s core values. In an effort to encourage meaningful discussion and drive real change in the licensing practices of entities that license (and may or may not directly manufacture or sell products) their respective patent portfolios, we called upon the IP industry to adopt similar initiatives that support technological advancements, investments in innovation and continued job creation, while preserving a strong patent system.  We continue to be involved in industry efforts in this area, we regularly receive feedback on our Licensing Best Practices, and we remain open to modifying our position based on potential adoption by broader industry groups.
Our Licensing Best Practices include seven actionable elements:

• | Ensure focused licensing and enforcement programs pursue the provider of the patented technology and not its customers, consumers or end users.


• | Conduct reasonable diligence to determine a patent's enforceability and use with respect to prospective licensees, and make that information available to them.


• | Respect procedural rights and judicial efficiency in the courts and in the prosecution and protection of IP behind the innovation.


• | Be transparent with the intent in each discussion, and articulate the cause and effect scenarios which would prompt a shift in communication and an escalation of each discussion.


• | Provide useful facts to prospective licensees and defendants to foster productive business discussions early and often to aid in informed decision-making.


• | Offer fair value licenses or settlements based on legitimate factors and considerations.


• | Commit to keeping lines of communications open between the patent owner and prospective licensee to preserve a path for the parties to find an amicable solution or resolution for their respective businesses.

In some cases, notwithstanding our pursuit of negotiated license transactions based on our Licensing Best Practices, unlicensed users of our technologies may be unwilling, at least initially, to negotiate or pay reasonable royalties for their use (i.e. infringement) of our patented technologies and often dispute any allegations of patent infringement.  If we believe a party is infringing one or more of our patents and such party refuses to take a license, we may institute legal action against such party. In a patent infringement lawsuit, we typically seek damages for past infringement and an injunction against future infringement. We evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, whether to commence litigation to preserve our patent rights, the value of our portfolio and the value of the licenses to our existing licensees.  Even if litigation is commenced, however, we endeavor to keep the option for early resolution of the dispute between the parties available to the extent practicable.
Licensing and Enforcement – Legacy Activities, Prior to 2013
In June 24, 2005, Finjan’s then parent, FSL, entered into a patent license agreement with Microsoft Corporation for $8 million in cash as well as other valuable financial and non-financial consideration.  The license grant includes, among other things, a worldwide, non-exclusive, nontransferable royalty-free license for Microsoft and its affiliates to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and distribute licensed products, among other rights.
In June 2006, Finjan, as successor to its parent FSI, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Secure Computing Corp. ("Secure") and its subsidiaries in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, resulting in a Judgment of approximately $37.3 million, including interest and enhancements.  In September 2011, Finjan received proceeds of approximately $28.0 million, net of $9.3 million contingency legal fees, from Secure including $3.1 million of interest, in satisfaction of the Judgment. 
 6

In July 2010, Finjan filed a patent infringement lawsuit against five additional software and technology companies in the U.S. District Court of Delaware, which we refer to as the “2010 Litigation.”  In April 2012, Finjan entered into a binding memorandum of understanding with one of the parties to the 2010 Litigation pursuant to which Finjan agreed to withdraw its claims against such party and grant it a license to use Finjan’s patents in exchange for equity in such party and other consideration. The license is fully paid up unless the holder of the license has aggregate annual net sales to third-party distributors or re-sellers in excess of $10 million (which has not been achieved to date). In addition, Finjan signed a confidential settlement, release and license agreement with another party to the 2010 Litigation in November 2012.  Pursuant to such agreement, Finjan received $85 million in exchange for a one-time fully paid-up license, comprising a perpetual, non-exclusive worldwide license to Finjan’s patent portfolio as of the date of such agreement and patents with a first effective priority date occurring at any time prior to November 2022 that Finjan or its affiliates may own or control after the date of such agreement.
Licensing and Enforcement – Current Activities, Post 2013
Since completing the merger in June 2013, we have commenced preliminary discussions with numerous potential licensees and have filed a number of patent infringement lawsuits in the Northern District of California, where such lawsuits were warranted.  In each case, we endeavor to adhere to our high standards and stated Licensing Best Practices.  For additional information regarding pending litigations, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.”
On September 24, 2014, Finjan entered into a license agreement with a third party against whom Finjan had filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the Northern District of California, in settlement of such suit.  Pursuant to this agreement, the parties mutually agreed to dismiss the infringement litigation, and each party gave the other a general release for all claims that it might have against the other, known or unknown, based on the actions of either party on or before the date of the settlement.  Under the license agreement, a third party agreed to pay Finjan a license fee of $8 million payable in four installments.  The first installment of $3 million was paid upon execution of the agreement and filing of the dismissal with prejudice, the second installment of $2 million was paid on January 16, 2015, the third installment of $2 million was paid on January 14, 2016, and the fourth and final installment of $1 million was paid on January 13, 2017.  
On April 7, 2015, Finjan entered into a Confidential Asset Purchase and Patent License Agreement, effective as of April 7, 2015, with F-Secure Corporation, a company incorporated in Finland (“F-Secure”). The agreement provides for F-Secure to pay Finjan the sum of $1.0 million in cash, of which $0.7 million was recognized as revenues in 2015 and the remaining balance of $0.3 million received and recorded as revenue on March 31, 2016, in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy, as described in Note 3 of our Financial Statements. The agreement also provides for the assignment by F-Secure to Finjan of two patents, U.S. Patent Nos. 8,474,048 and 7,769,991, including among other things, all progeny applications or patents, foreign counterparts and reissues (the “F-Secure Patents”). In exchange for the foregoing and other valuable consideration, Finjan agreed to, subject to certain restrictions, limits and other conditions, grant F-Secure a worldwide, fully-paid, non-exclusive field of use license to Finjan patents owned as of the effective date or acquired by Finjan or its affiliates within two years from the effective date, as well as to the F-Secure Patents.
On August 4, 2015, a Jury in the Northern District of California returned a verdict that Blue Coat Systems, Inc. ("Blue Coat") infringed 5 Finjan patents and awarded Finjan approximately $39.5 million in damages. Prior to the conclusion of this lawsuit, Finjan filed a second separate action against Blue Coat alleging infringement of Finjan patents by new products and services sold by Blue Coat. On October 14, 2016, Finjan filed a third case against Blue Coat in Germany. Finjan has not received any revenue from the present lawsuit with Blue Coat. The second case against Blue Coat is currently scheduled to go to trial in late 2017.
On November 15, 2015, Finjan and Avast Software s.r.o., a company organized under the laws of the Czech Republic ("Avast") entered into a Confidential Patent License, Settlement and Release Agreement, under which Avast licenses from Finjan a worldwide, fully-paid up, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license under the identified Finjan patents and related patent rights to use, make, have made, sell, offer to sell, import, export, and/or otherwise distribute Avast covered products through multiple tiers of distribution. In consideration of the agreement, Avast agreed to pay Finjan $2.975 million in cash which was recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy, as described in Note 3 of our Financial Statements. On January 19, 2017, Finjan filed a complaint against Avast as their recent acquisition of AVG triggered certain terms in the Patent License Agreement that excludes an acquired company’s products as licensed.
On December 30, 2015, Finjan and a U.S.-based network security company ("Licensee") entered into a Confidential Patent License, Settlement and Release Agreement under which Licensee receives from Finjan a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable license under the identified Finjan patents and related patent rights to use, make, have made, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise dispose of any and all Licensee products or services, alone or in combination with other Licensee products and services. In consideration for the license, Licensee agreed to pay Finjan $3.65 million. A first payment of $1.0 million on December 
 7

31, 2015 was recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the remaining $2.65 million was recorded as revenue in 2016, in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy, as described in Note 3 of our Financial Statements. 
On June 3, 2016, Finjan entered into a Confidential Patent License, Settlement and Release Agreement (“June 3, 2016 License”) with Proofpoint, Inc. (“Proofpoint”) and Armorize Technologies, Inc. As part of the June 3, 2016 License, Case No. 3:15-cv-5808-HSG, entitled Finjan, Inc. v. Proofpoint, Inc. and Armorize Technologies, Inc., pending before the Honorable Haywood S. Gilliam, Jr. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, was dismissed with prejudice on June 7, 2016. The June 3, 2016 License provides for Proofpoint to pay Finjan the sum of $10.9 million in cash, in which $4.3 million was received on June 6, 2016, $3.3 million was received on December 28, 2016, and $3.3 million is payable on or before January 3, 2018. The Company recognized $7.6 million of the $10.9 million license as revenues as of December 31, 2016, as such amount was determined to be fixed and determinable, in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy as described in Note 3. The remaining balance of $3.3 million under the terms of the June 3, 2016 License will be recognized as revenue when the payment is due. In exchange for the foregoing and other valuable consideration, Finjan agreed to, subject to certain restrictions, limits and other conditions, grant Proofpoint a worldwide, non-royalty bearing, fully paid-up (as of the final payment), nonexclusive, perpetual, irrevocable (except in the case of non-payment by Proofpoint or other material breach) license under Finjan’s patents as specified in the June 3, 2016 License. Certain portions of the June 3, 2016 License are subject to Confidential Treatment pursuant to a Confidential Treatment request filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on August 8, 2016 and Confidential Treatment Order granted by the SEC on September 26, 2016.
On June 30, 2016, Finjan entered into a Confidential Patent License Agreement (the “June 30, 2016 License”) with a European cloud-based network security firm (the “2016 European Licensee”). The June 30, 2016 License provides for the 2016 European Licensee to pay Finjan $565,000 in cash, which was paid on or about the time of execution of the June 30, 2016 License. Finjan recognized all of the $565,000 license as revenue as of December 31, 2016, as such amount was determined to be fixed and determinable, in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy as described in Note 3. In exchange for the foregoing and other valuable consideration, Finjan agreed to, subject to certain restrictions, limits and other conditions, grant the 2016 European Licensee a nonexclusive, term license in the United States under Finjan’s U.S. patents as specified in the June 30, 2016 License.
On September 21, 2016, following a two-week trial, a Jury in the Northern District of California returned a verdict that all five Finjan Patents were found literally infringed by Sophos, Inc. ("Sophos"). The jury verdict, decided that Finjan was entitled to $15 million in damages for Sophos’ infringement. Finjan has not received any revenue from the lawsuit with Sophos.
On November 1, 2016, the Company issued a press release announcing that in Finjan, Inc. v. Sophos Inc. (14-cv-1197-WHO), the Honorable William H. Orrick entered Judgment in favor of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Finjan, Inc. and against Sophos affirming the earlier $15.0 million Jury Verdict and Award entered on September 21, 2016. 
On December 28, 2016, Finjan entered into a Confidential Patent License Agreement (the “December 2016 License”) with F5 Networks, Inc. (“F5”). The December 2016 License provides for F5 to pay a license fee of $4.0 million in cash, which Finjan received on December 30, 2016. Finjan recognized all of the $4.0 million license as revenue as of December 31, 2016, as such amount was determined to be fixed and determinable, in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy as described in Note 3. In exchange for the foregoing and other valuable consideration, Finjan agreed to, subject to certain restrictions, limits and other conditions, grant F5 a nonexclusive, irrevocable (except in the case of non-payment by F5), worldwide paid-up license under Finjan’s patents as specified in the December 2016 License.
Future Growth Strategy

Our mission, for the foreseeable future, is to build a diversified cybersecurity company benefiting from historical investments in technology and patents while expanding into new product and service offerings. We believe our patented technologies continue to hold significant value and we intend to vigorously protect our investment, the value of our existing licensees’ investments, and the value that technology and intellectual property represents for our shareholders. We are pursuing and will continue to pursue our growth through the following strategies:

• | Develop and Expand Existing Patent Portfolio - We have obtained and endeavor to continue to obtain new patents relating to security technologies through research and development and/or acquisition in the cybersecurity space. For example, on: January 24, 2017, our subsidiary, Finjan Mobile, Inc., was issued a U.S. Patent No. 9,554,279 titled “Authorized Areas of Authentication.”

 8


• | Invest in Internal Research & Development through Finjan Mobile - We continue to pursue internal research and development of security technologies that both relate to Finjan's existing patented inventions as well as new concepts to meet an ever-expanding market need. Products currently available and in development include Finjan Mobile Secure Browser, VitalSecurity and next generation multi-factor authentication security applications utilizing geo-location techniques on mobile devices. The Company continues to explore inorganic growth, acquisition opportunities and partnerships to complement the vision for Finjan Mobile. 


• | Continue to Develop and Invest in CybeRisk - CybeRisk provides services to enterprise customers on a wide variety of threats, current and future issues, and prevention. CybeRisk's advisory services enable customers to accelerate the maturity of their cyber security posture and are intended to augment a company's own security and risk capabilities. We intend to further invest in CybeRisk and grow our cybersecurity advisory services business. This could include one or all of the following: the hiring of additional qualified personnel, the expansion of the business globally from its current headquarters in East Palo Alto with offices in Tel Aviv.


• | Expand our IP Assets through Acquisitions and Strategic Partnerships - We intend to acquire and develop new technologies and invest in intellectual property through strategic partnerships, acquisitions of technology-focused companies, IP portfolios or other assets and other initiatives. We endeavor to identify relevant security technologies and patents that have been, or are anticipated to be, widely adopted by third parties in connection with the manufacture or sale of products and services, and to which we can bring enforcement actions (i.e., licensing or litigation) and other expertise. We may also broaden our technology and patent holdings by working with inventors, acquiring technology companies, investing in research laboratories, start-ups, or universities, and by creating strategic partnerships with companies, large and small, seeking to effectively and efficiently monetize their technology and patent assets. While we anticipate that we will initially focus on acquisitions and strategic partnerships involving technologies relating to network, web and endpoint cybersecurity, we may seek to diversify to a broader market in the future. Our experience with monetizing both technologies and patents may be considered valuable by potential acquisition candidates and strategic partners who may lack resources or know-how to effectively and efficiently generate a return for those investments.


• | Continue to Demonstrate Best Practices in Pursuing Licensing Relationships and Enforcing our Patent Rights - In March 2014, we adopted Licensing Best Practices to demonstrate our commitment to ethical, transparent and consistent business practices for intellectual property licensing. We called upon and continue to promote industry-wide adoption of a set of licensing best practices, through leadership organizations such as the Licensing Executive Society and the Open Register of Patent Owners that support technological advancements, investments in innovation, and continued job creation while protected by a robust patent system. We intend to continue pursuing a proactive licensing campaign that adheres to our best practices guidelines while rigorously protecting our intellectual property rights. We have entered into preliminary discussions with numerous potential licensees in accordance with these Licensing Best Practices, but acknowledge that it takes many discussions and many months for preliminary discussions to culminate in a license agreement, if at all. While it is our preference to resolve our patent-related disputes through amicable business solutions, protecting the value of our patented technology is paramount. 

Although we currently pursue growth initiatives through the above strategies, unforeseen market and industry conditions and new developments may necessitate changes in our strategies. We intend to remain resilient, flexible, and open to new opportunities that benefit our shareholders.
Competition
One of our strategic goals is to leverage the operational platform we have built to realize value inherent in not only our existing patent portfolio and cybersecurity technologies, but also technologies and other assets to be developed and acquired in the future.  We expect, however, to encounter significant competition in the area of technology and intellectual property acquisitions given the highly competitive nature of the cybersecurity sector. In certain cases, we may partner with venture capital firms, strategic corporate buyers and various industry leaders to effectuate a technology acquisition or realize new licensing opportunities.  In other situations, these same venture capital firms, corporate buyers and industry players may be our direct competitors for the technology and intellectual property assets.  
We also face competitive pressures in the sense that companies may develop competing technologies that offer better or less expensive alternatives to our patented technologies (i.e. “design arounds”). Technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors could render certain of the technologies owned or controlled by our operating subsidiaries obsolete and/or materially reduce their value.

Patented Technologies
Through Finjan, we currently have twenty-eight U.S. patents. Finjan’s current U.S. issued patents begin expiring at various times from 2017 through 2032, and we also have two U.S. patent applications pending.  Finjan also has thirty-eight international patents and one international patent application pending, as of the date of this report. Although we may, from time to time, focus on monetizing certain of these patents, we consider all of our patents to be “core” patents for our business.
The following table sets forth a brief description of Finjan’s issued and pending U.S. patents, including their respective titles:

Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 12 full-time employees, on a consolidated basis and across all of our business lines.  We have budgeted to hire additional full-time employees (not including additional consultants or independent contractors) in the near future to expand our licensing and enforcement, mobile security and advisory services businesses. Personnel in our licensing and enforcement business are responsible for the execution of our licensing and enforcement strategy, including analyzing licensing opportunities and enforcement requirements, making tactical decisions related to our strategy, identifying new applications for our existing technologies and pursuing opportunities to invest in new technologies through strategic partnerships and acquisitions. Although our management dictates and controls our overall litigation strategy for each case we litigate (or settle), we use outside legal counsel to execute certain aspects of our strategies. We also use consultants, including Finjan’s founder and former Chief Technology Officer, Shlomo Touboul, to assess opportunities related to our technologies and additional technologies we may pursue in the future. We also expect to hire additional full-time employees into both our mobile security business, operated through our subsidiary Finjan Mobile and our advisory services business, operated through our subsidiary CybeRisk. We do not expect to hire any full-time employees to manage our investment in the JVP innovation fund.
Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.
