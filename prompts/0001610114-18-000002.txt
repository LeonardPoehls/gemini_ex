ITEM 1. BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW
We are a publicly traded REIT with a diversified portfolio of primarily private pay senior housing properties located across the United States. We were formed as a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Drive Shack Inc., formerly Newcastle Investment Corp. (“Drive Shack”), on May 17, 2012. On November 6, 2014, we were spun off from Drive Shack with the distribution of all our outstanding shares to the holders of Drive Shack common stock. We are listed on the NYSE under the symbol “SNR” and are headquartered in New York, New York.
We have a differentiated strategy of concentrating our investment activities on acquiring private pay senior housing and continue to be one of the largest owners of senior housing properties in the United States. As of December 31, 2017, our portfolio was comprised of 133 primarily private pay senior housing properties located across 37 states. We divide our properties into two reportable segments: (1) Managed Properties, which are operated by property managers pursuant to property management agreements and (2) Triple Net Lease Properties, which we lease to tenants through long-term triple net leases. See our consolidated financial statements and the related notes for additional information.
The majority of our portfolio is managed or leased by some of the largest and most experienced operators in the United States. Currently, our managed properties are managed by affiliates or subsidiaries of Holiday Retirement (“Holiday”), FHC Property Management LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “Blue Harbor”), Jerry Erwin Associates, Inc. (“JEA”), Thrive Senior Living LLC (“Thrive”), Grace Management, Inc. (“Grace”) and Watermark Retirement Communities, Inc. (“Watermark”). Our triple net lease properties are leased to Holiday and Watermark. Holiday is among the top three largest senior housing operators in the United States. The assets in our portfolio are described in more detail below under “Our Portfolio.”
Our investment strategy is focused on acquiring private pay senior housing properties which we believe is unique compared to our publicly traded peers. However, our investment guidelines are purposefully broad to enable us to make investments in a wide array of assets, and we actively explore new business opportunities and asset categories as part of our business strategy. For more information about our investment guidelines, see “Investment Guidelines” below.
Pursuant to a management agreement (the “Management Agreement”), we are externally managed and advised by FIG LLC (the “Manager”), an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC (“Fortress”), which is a leading global investment management firm with approximately $36.1 billion of assets under management as of September 30, 2017. Fortress, through the private equity funds managed by its affiliates, is a large investor in the senior housing sector. Our Manager (or its affiliates) also manages private equity funds that currently own a majority of Holiday. Blue Harbor is an affiliate of our Manager. On December 27, 2017, Softbank announced that it completed its previously announced acquisition of Fortress (the “Softbank Merger”). In connection with the Softbank Merger, Fortress will operate within SoftBank as an independent business headquartered in New York. Fortress’s senior investment professionals will remain in place, including those individuals who perform services for us.
INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
During 2017, we sold 13 properties in the Managed Properties segment and 6 properties in the Triple Net Lease Properties segment. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
MARKET OPPORTUNITY
Opportunity to Consolidate Large and Fragmented Industry
We believe there are significant investment opportunities in the U.S. senior housing market driven by three factors: (i) growing demand from significant increases in the senior citizen population, (ii) highly fragmented ownership of senior housing properties among many smaller local (“mom and pop”) and regional owner/operators and (iii) operational improvement opportunities to increase property-level net operating income. We estimate the size of the senior housing industry in the United States to be approximately $300 billion, and, according to the 2017 American Seniors Housing Association 50 Report, approximately 61% of these senior housing facilities are owned by mom and pop operators with 5 or fewer properties.

Attractive Demand - Supply Fundamentals to Drive Organic Growth
We believe that the rapidly growing senior citizen population in the U.S. will result in a substantially increased demand for senior housing properties as the baby boomer generation ages, life expectancies lengthen and more health-related services are demanded. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the total number of people aged 65 and older is expected to increase from approximately 47.8 million in 2015 to 79.2 million by 2035, with the number of citizens aged 65 and older expected to grow at four times the rate of the overall population by 2035. Healthcare is the largest private-sector industry in the U.S., with healthcare expenditures in the U.S. accounting for approximately 18% of gross domestic product in 2015. According to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the average annual compounded growth rate for national healthcare expenditures from 2015 through 2025 is expected to be 5.6%. Additionally, senior citizens are the largest consumers of healthcare services. The target age group for our properties is Americans over 70 years old while a typical resident is 80 to 85 years of age. According to CMS, average per capita healthcare expenditures by those 65 years and older continue to be about three times more than the average spent by those 19 to 64 years old. Demand for senior housing is driven both by growth of an aging population and by an increasing array of services and support required by residents. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the percentage of Americans between ages 75 and 79 seeking assistance with basic and instrumental activities of daily living is 15%, increasing to 30% for Americans over 80 years of age. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, approximately one-third of individuals over age 85 have Alzheimer’s disease. To address these resident needs, senior housing provides varying and flexible levels of services. While our target population is growing, the rate of supply growth has also increased in recent years. However, according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care (“NIC”), senior housing occupancy is projected to be stable in 2018. 
Differentiated Strategy Focused on Private Pay Senior Housing
We have generally sought investments in senior housing facilities that have an emphasis on private pay sources of revenue which is considered more stable and predictable compared to government reimbursed property types. We believe this strategy distinguishes us from our publicly traded peers. Private pay residents are individuals who are personally obligated to pay the costs of their housing and services without relying significantly on reimbursement payments from Medicaid or Medicare. Sources for these private payments include: (i) pensions, savings and retirement funds; (ii) proceeds from the sale of real estate and personal property; (iii) assistance from residents’ families; and (iv) private insurance. While our investments may have some level of revenues related to government reimbursements, we focus on investments with high levels of private pay revenue and, for the year ended December 31, 2017, private pay sources represented 98% of the property level revenue from the residents at our facilities. Private pay facilities are not subject to governmental rate setting and, accordingly, we believe they provide for more predictable and higher rental rates from residents than facilities primarily reliant on government-funded sources.
The senior housing industry offers a full continuum of care to seniors with product types that range from “mostly housing” (i.e., senior apartments) to “mostly healthcare” (i.e., skilled nursing, hospitals, etc.). We primarily focus on product types at the center of this continuum, namely independent living (“IL”) properties and AL/MC properties. Many of our peers have significant exposure to skilled nursing facilities and hospitals providing higher acuity levels of healthcare. Accordingly, these peers have higher levels of exposure to revenues derived from Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements. Our facilities are predominantly reliant on private pay sources of revenue and have limited risk exposure to regulatory changes in the healthcare arena. We believe that our focused portfolio of primarily IL and AL/MC properties will allow investors to participate in the positive fundamentals of the senior housing sector without similar levels of risk exposure associated with higher acuity types of healthcare real estate. 
Attractive Portfolio Diversified by Product Type, Operating Model and Geography
We started building our platform in July 2012 and currently own 133 properties with a gross real estate value of $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2017. Our portfolio is diversified in terms of product type, operating model and geography. As of December 31, 2017, we have 102 IL properties, 30 AL/MC properties and one rental Continuing Care Retirement Communities (“CCRC”) property across 37 states. Our portfolio provides an attractive mix of triple net lease and managed properties. At December 31, 2017, our triple net lease portfolio totaled 52 properties (51 IL properties and one rental CCRC property), and our managed properties portfolio totaled 81 properties (51 IL properties and 30 AL/MC properties).

Manager Expertise Owning and Operating Senior Housing
We are externally managed and advised by an affiliate of Fortress, a large investor with over 15 years of experience in the senior housing sector. Our Manager and its affiliates have a far-reaching presence in consumer-facing industries across the United States through Fortress’s investments in healthcare, leisure, gaming, real estate and transportation companies. Private equity funds managed by an affiliate of Fortress and our Manager currently own a majority of Holiday, the largest independent living operator in the United States with over 250 properties as of December 31, 2017, and Blue Harbor is an affiliate of our Manager. Due to this presence, we believe we are able to achieve volume discounts for services and products at many of our properties, such as insurance and food and beverage.
Tax Efficient REIT Status
We have elected to be treated as a REIT, and we intend to operate in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. Our REIT status provides us with certain tax advantages compared to some of our competitors. Those advantages include an ability to reduce our corporate-level income taxes by making dividend distributions to our stockholders and an ability to pass our capital gains through to our stockholders in the form of capital gains dividends. We believe our REIT status provides us with a significant advantage as compared to other companies or industry participants who do not have a similar tax efficient structure.
SENIOR HOUSING INDUSTRY
Overview
For an overview of the senior housing industry, see “Opportunity to Consolidate Large and Fragmented Industry” and “Attractive Demand - Supply Fundamentals to Drive Organic Growth.”
Government Regulations
AL/MC properties and operations are subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse practices, government reimbursement, licensure and certificate of need (“CON”) and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare properties. While the AL/MC properties within our portfolio are subject to many varying types of regulatory and licensing requirements, we expect that the healthcare industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation, enforcement and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost control, healthcare management and provision of services, among others. In fact, some states have revised and strengthened their regulation of senior housing properties and, that trend may continue. In addition, efforts by third-party payors, such as Governmental Programs (as defined below) and private insurance payor organizations (which include insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other types of health plans/managed care organizations) to impose more stringent controls upon operators are expected to intensify and continue. Changes in applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.
As used in this section, “Governmental Program” means, individually and collectively, any federal, state or local governmental reimbursement programs administered through a governmental body, agency thereof or contractor thereof (including a Governmental Program Payor) including, without limitation, the Medicare and Medicaid programs or successor programs to any of the aforementioned programs. “Governmental Program Payor” means a private insurance payor organization which has a contract with a Governmental Program to arrange for the provision of assisted living property or skilled nursing facility (“SNF”) services to Governmental Program beneficiaries and which receives reimbursement from the Governmental Program to do so.

Our AL/MC senior housing properties are regulated by state and local laws governing licensure, provision of services, staffing requirements and other operational matters. The laws that govern our properties vary greatly from one jurisdiction to another. Owners and/or operators of certain senior housing properties, including, but not limited to, AL/MC properties, are required to be licensed or certified by the state in which they operate. In granting and renewing such licenses, the state regulatory agencies consider numerous factors relating to a property’s physical plant and operations, including, but not limited to, admission and discharge standards, staffing and training. A decision to grant or renew a license may also be affected by a property’s record with respect to licensure compliance, patient and consumer rights, medication guidelines and other regulations. Certain states require additional licensure and impose additional staffing and other operational standards in order for a property to provide higher levels of assisted living services. Senior housing properties may also be subject to state and/or local building, zoning, fire and food service laws before licensing or certification may be granted. Our properties may also be affected by changes in accreditation standards or procedures of accreditation bodies that are recognized by states or a Governmental Program in the licensure or certification process.
In the future, we may also acquire senior housing properties that include SNFs. SNFs are licensed by the state in which the facility is located, and, if an owner chooses to participate in Medicaid, Medicare or certain other Governmental Programs, the facility must also be certified to participate in such programs. In that regard, SNFs are particularly subject to myriad, comprehensive federal Medicare and Medicaid certification requirements that not only require state licensure but also separately (apart from state licensure) regulate the type and quality of the medical and/or nursing care provided, ancillary services (e.g., respiratory, occupational, physical and infusion therapies), qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff, the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment, reimbursement and rate setting and other operational issues and policies.
In the future, we may also acquire certain healthcare properties (including assisted living properties in some states and SNFs in most states) that are subject to a variety of CON or similar laws. Where applicable, such laws generally require, among other requirements, as a predicate to licensure that a facility demonstrate the need for (i) constructing a new facility, (ii) adding beds or expanding an existing facility, (iii) investing in major capital equipment or adding new services, (iv) changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility, or (v) terminating services that have been previously approved through the CON process. These laws could affect, and even restrict, our ability to expand into new markets and to expand our properties and services in existing markets. In addition, CON laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator. If we have to replace a facility operator who is excluded from participating in a federal or state healthcare program (as discussed below), our ability to replace the operator may be affected by a particular state’s CON laws, regulations and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control.
Aside from CON considerations, transfers of ownership, provider control and/or operations of assisted living properties and SNFs are subject to licensure and other regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and real estate. These regulations may also constrain or even impede our ability to replace property managers or tenants of our properties, and they may also impact our acquisition or sale of senior housing properties. In addition, if any of our licensed properties operate outside of its licensed authority, doing so could subject the facility to penalties, including closure of the facility. Failure to obtain licensure or loss or suspension of licensure or certification may prevent an assisted living property or SNF from operating or result in a suspension of Governmental Program reimbursement payment until all licensure or certification issues have been resolved.
A significant portion of the revenues received by our properties are from self-pay residents. The remaining revenue source is primarily Medicaid under certain federal waiver programs. As a part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (“OBRA”), Congress established a waiver program enabling some states to offer Medicaid reimbursement to assisted living providers as an alternative to institutional long-term care services. The provisions of OBRA and subsequent federal enactments permit states to seek a waiver from typical Medicaid requirements to develop cost-effective alternatives to long-term care, including Medicaid payments for assisted living and, in some instances, including payment for such services through Governmental Program Payors. In 2016, approximately 2% of the revenues at our senior housing properties were from Medicaid reimbursement. There can be no guarantee that a state Medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status, that funding levels will not decrease or that eligibility requirements will not change.
Rates paid by self-pay residents of properties within our Managed Properties segment are determined in accordance with applicable provisions of the management agreements entered into with our property managers, and are impacted by local market conditions and operating costs. Rates paid by self-pay residents of properties within our Triple Net Lease Properties segment are determined by the tenant.

The level of assisted living Medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state. Thus, the revenues generated by our assisted living properties may be adversely affected by payor mix, acuity level, changes in Medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels. In addition, a state could lose its Medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted to utilize Medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living services. Such changes in revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business.
Unlike assisted living operators, SNF operators typically receive most of their revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, with the balance representing reimbursement payments from private insurance payor organizations (and perhaps minimal self-pay). Consequently, changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may also adversely affect our business if we acquire properties with a SNF component.
The percentage of federal Medicaid revenue support used for long-term care varies from state to state, due in part to different ratios of elderly population and eligibility requirements. Within certain federal guidelines, states have a fairly wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and to establish a reimbursement methodology for SNF Medicaid patients. Many states reimburse SNFs pursuant to fixed daily Medicaid rates which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care. Reasonable costs typically include allowances for staffing, administrative and general expenses, property and equipment (e.g., real estate taxes, depreciation and fair rental).
The Medicare SNF benefit covers skilled nursing care, rehabilitation services and other goods and services, and the facility receives a pre-determined daily rate for each day of care, up to 100 days. These prospective payment system (“PPS”) rates are expected to cover all operating and capital costs that efficient properties would be expected to incur in furnishing most SNF services, with certain high-cost, low-probability ancillary services paid separately.
There is a risk that some skilled nursing facilities’ costs could exceed the fixed payments under the prospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities (“SNF PPS”), and there is also a risk that payments under the SNF PPS may be set below the costs to provide certain items and services, which could have a material adverse effect on an SNF. Further, SNFs are subject to periodic pre and post-payment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities. Such a review or audit could result in recoupments, denials, or delay of payments in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the business of a SNF.
In the ordinary course of business, our AL/MC properties have been and are subject regularly to inspections, inquiries, investigations and audits by state agencies that oversee applicable laws and regulations. State licensure laws and, where applicable, Governmental Program certification, require license renewals and compliance surveys on an annual or bi-annual basis. The failure of our AL/MC property managers to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval, as well as the failure of our managers to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey, could result in the suspension of operations at a property. In addition, if an AL/MC or SNF property, where applicable, is found to be out of compliance with Governmental Program conditions of participation, the property’s manager may be excluded from participating in those Governmental Programs. Any such occurrence may impair the ability of a property manager to meet its obligations. If we have to replace a property manager, our ability to do so may be affected by the federal and state regulations governing such changes. This may result in payment delays, an inability to find a replacement property manager or other difficulties. Unannounced surveys or inspections of a property may occur annually or bi-annually or following a regulator’s receipt of a complaint regarding the property. From time-to-time, our properties receive deficiency reports from state regulatory bodies resulting from such inspections or surveys. Most deficiencies are resolved through a plan of corrective action relating to the property’s operations but, whether the deficiencies are cured or not, the applicable governmental authority typically has the authority to take further action against a licensee. Such an action could result in the imposition of fines, imposition of a provisional or conditional license, suspension or revocation of a license or Governmental Program participation, suspension or denial of admissions or imposition of other sanctions, including criminal penalties. The imposition of such sanctions may adversely affect our business.

Assisted living properties and SNFs that participate in Governmental Programs are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, including implementing regulations and applicable governmental guidance that govern the operational, financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare properties and other providers. Certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by Governmental Programs. Other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the Governmental Program and Governmental Program Payors valid and accurate statements for each service, and other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety, health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided. Sanctions for violations of these laws may include, but are not limited to, criminal and/or civil penalties and fines, loss of licensure, immediate termination of government payments and exclusion from any Governmental Program participation. In certain circumstances, violation of these laws (such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior and, in the case of Governmental Program Payors, also prohibiting insurance fraud) with respect to one property may subject other properties under common control or ownership to sanctions, including exclusion from participation in Governmental Programs. In the ordinary course of business, our properties are regularly subjected to inquiries, investigations and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws.
All healthcare providers, including, but not limited to, assisted living properties and SNFs that participate in Governmental Programs, are also subject to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a criminal statute which generally prohibits persons from offering, providing, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal Governmental Program. SNFs and certain other types of healthcare properties and providers are also subject to the Federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the “Stark Law.” The Stark Law generally prohibits the submission of claims to Medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship under the Stark Law. Many states have similar prohibitions on physician self-referrals and submission of claims which are applicable to all payor sources, including state Medicaid programs.
Further, healthcare properties and other providers, including, but not limited to, assisted living properties and SNFs, that receive Governmental Program payments, are subject to substantial financial and other (in some cases, criminal) penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Act, the Federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions under the Federal False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” provisions. Violations of these laws can also subject persons and entities to termination from participation in Governmental Programs or result in the imposition of substantial damages, fines or other penalties. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the Federal False Claims Act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits brought by private individuals, known as “qui tam actions,” may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former patients, nurses and other employees. Significantly, if a claim is successfully adjudicated, the Federal False Claims Act provides for treble damages in addition to penalties up to $11,000 per claim. Various state false claim act and anti-kickback laws may also apply to each property operator, regardless of payor source (i.e., such as a private insurance payor organization or a Governmental Program), and violations of those state laws can also result in substantial fines and/or adverse licensure actions to our material detriment.
Government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the healthcare industry have increased dramatically over the past several years and are expected to continue. Some of these enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application of the Federal False Claims Act. Governmental agencies, both state and federal, are also devoting increasing attention and resources to anti-fraud initiatives against healthcare properties and other providers. Legislative developments, including changes to federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), have greatly expanded the definition of healthcare fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include certain private insurance payor organizations in addition to Governmental Programs. Congress also has greatly increased funding for the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to audit, investigate and prosecute suspected healthcare fraud. Moreover, a significant portion of the billions in healthcare fraud recoveries over the past several years has also been returned to government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation and prosecution efforts.

HIPAA regulations provide for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information. In order to comply with the regulations, healthcare providers often must undertake significant operational and technical implementation efforts. Operators also may face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain the privacy and security of medical records and other personal health information about individuals. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), passed in February 2009, strengthened the HHS Secretary’s authority to impose civil money penalties for HIPAA violations occurring after February 18, 2009. HITECH directs the HHS Secretary to provide for periodic audits to ensure that covered entities and their business associates (as that term is defined under HIPAA) comply with the applicable HITECH requirements, increasing the likelihood that a HIPAA violation will result in an enforcement action. The CMS issued an interim final rule which conformed HIPAA enforcement regulations to HITECH, increasing the maximum penalty for multiple violations of a single requirement or prohibition to $1.5 million. Higher penalties may accrue for violations of multiple requirements or prohibitions. Additionally, on January 17, 2013, the CMS released a final rule, which expands the applicability of HIPAA and HITECH and strengthens the government’s ability to enforce these laws. The final rule broadens the definition of “business associate” and provides for civil money penalty liability against covered entities and business associates for the acts of their agents regardless of whether a business associate agreement is in place. Additionally, the final rule adopts certain changes to the HIPAA enforcement regulations to incorporate the increased and tiered civil monetary penalty structure provided by HITECH, and makes business associates of covered entities directly liable under HIPAA for compliance with certain of the HIPAA privacy standards and HIPAA security standards. HIPAA violations are also potentially subject to criminal penalties.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Affordable Care Act”) and the HealthCare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which amends the Affordable Care Act (collectively, the “Health Reform Laws”), and the June 28, 2012 United States Supreme Court ruling upholding the individual mandate of the Health Reform Laws and partially invalidating the expansion of Medicaid (further discussed below) may have a significant impact on Medicare, Medicaid and other Governmental Programs, as well as private insurance payor organizations, which in turn may impact the reimbursement amounts received by our properties which participate in Governmental Programs. In fact, the Health Reform Laws could have a substantial and material adverse effect on all parties directly or indirectly involved in the healthcare system. Together, the Health Reform Laws make the most sweeping and fundamental changes to the U.S. healthcare system undertaken since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid and contain various provisions that may directly impact our business.
These new Health Reform Laws include, without limitation, the expansion of Medicaid eligibility, requiring most individuals to have health insurance, establishing new regulations on certain private insurance payor organizations (including Governmental Program Payors), establishing health insurance exchanges and modifying certain payment systems to encourage more cost-effective care and a reduction of inefficiencies and waste, including through new tools to address fraud and abuse. Because many of our properties deliver healthcare services, we will be impacted by the risks associated with the healthcare industry, including the Health Reform Laws. While the expansion of healthcare coverage may result in some additional demand for services provided by our properties, reimbursement levels may be lower than the costs required to provide such services, which could materially adversely affect our business. The Health Reform Laws also enhance certain fraud and abuse penalty provisions in the event of one or more violations of the federal healthcare regulatory laws. In addition, the Health Reform Laws have provisions that impact the health coverage that our property managers or tenants provide to their respective employees. We cannot predict whether the existing Health Reform Laws, or future healthcare reform legislation or regulatory changes, will have a material impact on our business.
Additionally, certain provisions of the Health Reform Laws are designed to increase transparency and program integrity of SNFs. Specifically, SNFs will be required to institute compliance and ethics programs. Additionally, the Health Reform Laws make it easier for consumers to file complaints against nursing homes by mandating that states establish complaint websites. The provisions calling for enhanced transparency will increase the administrative burden and costs on SNF providers.

(B) | Revenues relate to the period the properties were owned by us in a calendar year and, therefore, are not indicative of full-year results for all properties.

For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 the average occupancy rate of our managed portfolio was 85.7% and 88.0%, respectively, and the average occupancy rate for our triple net portfolio was 85.6% and 88.0%, respectively.
We classify our properties by asset type and operating model, as described in more detail below.
Product Type
IL Properties: IL properties are age-restricted, multifamily properties with central dining that provide residents access to meals and other services such as housekeeping, linen service, transportation and social and recreational activities. A typical resident is 80 to 85 years old and is relatively healthy. Residents are typically charged all-inclusive monthly rates.
AL/MC Properties: AL/MC properties are state-regulated rental properties that provide the same services as IL properties and additionally have staff to provide residents assistance with activities of daily living, such as management of medications, bathing, dressing, toileting, ambulating and eating. AL/MC properties may include memory care properties that specifically provide care for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia or memory loss. The average age of an AL/MC resident is similar to that of an IL resident, but AL/MC residents typically have greater healthcare needs. Residents are typically charged all-inclusive monthly rates for IL services and additional “care charges” for AL/MC services, which vary depending on the types of services required. AL/MC properties are generally private pay, although many states will allow residents to cover a portion of the cost with Medicaid.
CCRC Properties: CCRCs are a particular type of retirement community that offers several levels (generally more than three) of health care at one facility or campus, often including independent living, assisted living/memory care and skilled nursing. CCRCs offer a tiered approach to the aging process, accommodating residents’ changing needs as they age.

Operating Model
Managed Properties: We have entered into long-term property management agreements for our managed properties with Blue Harbor, Holiday, JEA, Thrive, Grace and Watermark. Our property management agreements have initial five-year or ten-year terms, with successive, automatic one-year renewal periods. We pay property management fees of 5% to 7% of effective gross income pursuant to our property management agreements with Holiday and, in some cases, Holiday is eligible to earn an incentive fee based on operating performance. We pay property management fees of 3% to 7% of gross revenues and, for certain properties, a property management fee based on a percentage of net operating income, pursuant to our property management agreements with other managers. As the owner of the Managed Properties, we are responsible for the properties’ operating costs, including repairs, maintenance, capital expenditures, utilities, taxes, insurance and the payroll expense of property-level employees. The payroll expense is structured as a reimbursement to the property manager, who is the employer of record. We have various rights as the property owner under our property management agreements, including rights to set budget guidelines and to terminate and exercise remedies under those agreements as provided therein. However, we rely on our property managers’ personnel, expertise, technical accounting resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our senior housing operations efficiently and effectively. We also rely on our property managers to otherwise operate our properties in compliance with the terms of the management agreements, although we have various rights as the property owner to terminate and exercise remedies under the management agreements.
Triple Net Lease Properties: These properties are leased to tenants pursuant to triple net leases. Our triple net lease arrangements have initial terms of approximately 15 or 17 years and include renewal options and annual rent increases ranging from 2.5% to 4.5% based on changes in the consumer price index (“CPI”). Under each triple net master lease, the respective tenant is typically responsible for (i) operating its portion of the portfolio and bearing the related costs, including repairs, maintenance, capital expenditures, utilities, taxes, insurance and the payroll expense of property-level employees, and (ii) complying with the terms of the mortgage financing documents. The obligations of the tenant under the triple net master leases with Holiday (the “Holiday Portfolios”) are guaranteed to us by a subsidiary of Holiday, although there can be no assurance that we would be able to fully recover any amounts owed to us from either the tenant or the guarantor. Both the tenant and the guarantor of the Holiday Portfolios are affiliates of Fortress.

FINANCING STRATEGY
Our ability to access capital in a timely and cost effective manner is critical to the success of our business strategy because it affects our ability to make future investments. Our access to and cost of external capital are dependent on various factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, expectations of our potential future earnings and cash distributions and the trading price of our common stock.
We employ leverage as part of our investment strategy. We do not have a predetermined target debt to equity ratio as we believe the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we are financing depends on the credit quality of those assets. We utilize leverage for the sole purpose of financing our portfolio and not for the purpose of speculating on changes in interest rates. We strive to maintain our financial strength and invest profitably by actively managing our leverage, optimizing our capital structure and developing our access to multiple sources of liquidity. Historically, we have relied primarily on non-recourse mortgage notes to finance a portion of our real estate investments. We may, over time, seek access to additional sources of liquidity, including revolving credit agreements, bank debt, U.S. government agency financing and the unsecured public debt and equity markets. Generally, we attempt to match the long-term duration of our investments in senior housing properties with staggered maturities of long-term debt and equity. As of December 31, 2017, 35.9% of our consolidated debt was variable rate debt.
Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we may, from time to time, utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk associated with our borrowings. These derivative instruments may include interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements, interest rate floor or collar agreements or other financial instruments that we deem appropriate.
INVESTMENT GUIDELINES
Our board of directors has adopted a broad set of investment guidelines to be used by our Manager to evaluate specific investments. Our general investment guidelines prohibit any investment that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. These investment guidelines may be changed by our board of directors without the approval of our stockholders. If our board changes any of our investment guidelines, we will disclose such changes in our next required periodic report.
Management Agreement
In connection with the spin-off from Drive Shack, we entered into a Management Agreement with the Manager, an affiliate of Fortress, pursuant to which the Manager provides a management team and other professionals who are responsible for implementing our business strategy, subject to the supervision of our board of directors. Our Manager is responsible for, among other things, (i) setting investment criteria in accordance with broad investment guidelines adopted by our board of directors, (ii) sourcing, analyzing and executing acquisitions, (iii) providing financial and accounting management services and (iv) performing other duties as specified in the Management Agreement. Our Management Agreement has an initial ten-year term and will be automatically renewed for one-year terms thereafter unless terminated either by us or our Manager. Our Manager is also entitled to receive a termination fee from us under certain circumstances. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to the terms of the Management Agreement. 
POLICIES WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN OTHER ACTIVITIES
Subject to the approval of our board of directors, we have the authority to offer our common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our common stock or any other securities and may engage in such activities in the future.
We also may make loans to, or provide guarantees of certain obligations of, our subsidiaries.
Subject to the percentage ownership and gross income and asset tests necessary for REIT qualification, we may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities.
We may engage in the purchase and sale of investments.
Our officers and directors may change any of these policies and our investment guidelines without a vote of our stockholders.
11

In the event that we determine to raise additional equity capital, our board of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval (subject to certain NYSE requirements), to issue additional common stock or preferred stock in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate, including in exchange for property.
Decisions regarding the form and other characteristics of the financing for our investments are made by our Manager, subject to the general investment guidelines adopted by our board of directors.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Although we have established certain policies and procedures designed to mitigate conflicts of interest, there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective in doing so. Actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest have given, and in the future could give, rise to investor dissatisfaction, settlements with stockholders, litigation or regulatory inquiries or enforcement actions. Below is a summary of certain factors that could result in conflicts of interest.
One or more of our officers and directors have responsibilities and commitments to entities other than us, including, but not limited to, Drive Shack and Fortress. In addition, we do not have a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, officers, security holders or affiliates from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Moreover, our certificate of incorporation provides that if any of the officers, directors or employees of Drive Shack or Fortress acquire knowledge of a potential transaction that could be a corporate opportunity for us, they have no duty, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to offer such corporate opportunity to us. In the event that any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer or employee of Drive Shack or Fortress acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity, provided that this knowledge was not acquired solely in such person’s capacity as a director or officer of us and such person acts in good faith, then such person is deemed to have fully satisfied such person’s fiduciary duties owed to us and is not liable to us, to the fullest extent permitted by law, if Drive Shack or Fortress or their affiliates, pursues or acquires the corporate opportunity or if such person does not present the corporate opportunity to us. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Manager-There are conflicts of interest in our relationship with our Manager.”
Our key agreements, including the Management Agreement, were negotiated among related parties, and their respective terms, including fees and other amounts payable, may not be as favorable to us as terms negotiated on an arm’s-length basis with unaffiliated parties. Our independent directors may not vigorously enforce the provisions of our Management Agreement against our Manager. For example, our independent directors may refrain from terminating our Manager because doing so could result in the loss of key personnel.
The structure of the Manager’s compensation arrangement may have unintended consequences for us. We have agreed to pay our Manager a management fee that is not tied to our performance and incentive compensation that is based entirely on our performance. The management fee may not sufficiently incentivize our Manager to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for us, while the performance-based incentive compensation component may cause our Manager to place undue emphasis on the maximization of earnings, including through the use of leverage, at the expense of other objectives, such as preservation of capital, to achieve higher incentive distributions. Since investments with higher yield potential are generally riskier or more speculative than investments with lower yield potential, this could result in increased risk to the value of our portfolio of assets and your investment in us.
We may compete with entities affiliated with our Manager or Fortress for certain assets that we may seek to acquire. From time to time, affiliates of Fortress may focus on investments in assets with a similar profile as our target assets. These affiliates may have meaningful purchasing capacity, which may change over time depending upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, available equity capital and debt financing, market conditions and cash on hand. Fortress manages two private equity funds that were primarily focused on investing in senior housing properties with approximately $1.6 billion in capital commitments in aggregate, as well as other funds with significant investments in senior housing. All of these private equity funds are outside their respective investment periods (including one that is in liquidation), although one of these funds has approximately $120 million in unfunded commitments that may be drawn for follow-on investments. Fortress private equity funds generally have a fee structure similar to the structure of the fees in our Management Agreement, but the fees actually paid will vary depending on the size, terms and performance of each fund. Consistent with well-established standard practice in the alternative asset management industry, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, Wesley Edens, has made meaningful personal investments in each of the private equity funds that Fortress manages, including the funds that own a majority of Holiday.
12

Our Manager may determine, in its discretion, to make a particular investment through an investment vehicle other than us. Investment allocation decisions will reflect a variety of factors, such as a particular vehicle’s availability of capital (including financing), investment objectives and concentration limits, legal, regulatory, tax and other similar considerations, the source of the investment opportunity and other factors that the Manager, in its discretion, deems appropriate. Our Manager does not have an obligation to offer us the opportunity to participate in any particular investment, even if it meets our investment objectives.
OPERATIONAL AND REGULATORY STRUCTURE
REIT Qualification
We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”), relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels to our stockholders and the concentration of ownership of our capital stock. Commencing with our initial taxable year ending December 31, 2014, we have been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code and we believe that our intended manner of operation will continue to enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT.
COMPETITION
We generally compete for investments in senior housing with other market participants, such as other REITs, real estate partnerships, private equity and hedge fund investors, banks, insurance companies, finance and investment companies, government-sponsored agencies, healthcare operators, developers and other investors. Many of our anticipated competitors are significantly larger than we are, have access to greater capital and other resources and may have other advantages over us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could lead them to offer higher prices for assets that we might be interested in acquiring and cause us to lose bids for those assets. In addition, other potential purchasers of senior housing properties may be more attractive to sellers of senior housing properties if the sellers believe that these potential purchasers could obtain any necessary third party approvals and consents more easily than us.
Our property managers and tenants compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties that provide comparable services. Operators compete for residents based on a number of factors including quality of care, reputation, physical appearance of properties, location, services offered, family preferences, staff and price. We also face competition from other healthcare facilities for residents, such as physicians and other healthcare providers that provide comparable properties and services, as well as home care options, including technology-enabled home health care options.
EMPLOYEES
Pursuant to the Management Agreement, all of our officers are employees of our Manager or an affiliate of our Manager. We do not have any employees.
As the owner of managed properties, we are responsible for the payroll expense of property-level employees (as well as the properties’ other operating costs). The payroll expense is structured as a reimbursement to the property manager, who is the employer of record.
