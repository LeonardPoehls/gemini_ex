Description of Business
 
Corporate History and Background
 
Corporate Overview
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 22, 2002, under the name of Medina International Corp. On May 4, 2006, we changed our name to ACRO Inc. On May 28, 2014 we changed our name to Transatlantic Capital Inc.
 
Initially, our business had been to provide professional consulting services for the technical and economic evaluation of petroleum and natural gas resources. We were not successful with this business endeavor. We then endeavored to exploit a patent that we purchased (Patent No. 6.767,717) for the detection of peroxide-based explosives. Due to rising costs, our cash flow was adversely affected and with additional financing unavailable we terminated this business.
 
At December 31, 2016 we had no business operations.
 
Reverse Split
 
In January 2012, we effectuated a one for ten (1:10) reverse stock split of our common stock.  
 
In May 2014, we reverse split our common stock on a 1:150 basis.
 
Business Objective:
 
We are currently a shell entity. We have no business operations and nominal cash available to conduct operations
 We have relied on loans from our officers, directors and shareholders to finance our operations. We have no commitment for additional funding. As a result, we will require a significant cash infusion to commence operations and implement our business plan. With a new and experienced management team, our goal is to take advantage of opportunities in the real estate field. As more specifically described below, we intend to identify unique opportunities in commercial properties in the retail, office and industrial sectors throughout the United States and Canada. We may also invest in real estate in either Europe or Africa should the opportunity arise. Further, we are exploring real estate opportunities in cannabis.
 
The implementation of our business plan will require a significant cash infusion of which there can be no assurance.
 Investment Objectives and Policies
 Our investment strategy is to invest in, purchase, develop and sell within a diversified portfolio of commercial properties in the retail, office and industrial sectors. To the extent that the cannabis industry offers opportunities, we may pursue opportunities in this business endeavor as well.
 Our primary investment objectives are:
 
• | to acquire quality commercial real estate properties which provide current operating cash flow; and 
• | to provide a stable source of operating income; and benefit from any capital appreciation of our investments 

 We cannot assure investors that we will achieve any of these objectives. Our Board of Directors will at all times have ultimate oversight over our investments.

Acquisition and Investment Policies:
 
The following discussion assumes that we are able to secure a minimum of $5 million in debt or equity financing. However, we will require significantly more than $5 million in financing to fully implement our business plan. 
Commercial Real Estate Properties
 
We intend to invest primarily in single-tenant, necessity commercial properties, which are leased to creditworthy tenants under long-term net leases and provide current operating cash flow. We use the term necessity commercial properties to describe retail properties that are important to customers and office and industrial properties that are essential to the business operations of a corporate tenant. The actual percentage of our portfolio that is invested in the retail, office and industrial property categories may fluctuate due to market conditions and investment opportunities.
 
Necessity retail describes companies that provide consumers with products that are important to, and part of, their everyday lives. Examples of necessity retail properties include pharmacies, home improvement stores, national superstores, restaurants and regional retailers that provide products considered necessities to that region. Historically, the retail sector of commercial real estate has been able to withstand most market cycles better than other sectors, due to the long-term resilience of consumer spending.
 

Necessity office and industrial properties are essential to the business
operations of a corporate tenant, typically due to one or more of the following factors:
difficulty of replacement or prohibitive costs to relocate;
sole or major location for its distribution or office operations
proximity to its distribution, manufacturing, research facilities or
customer base;
lower labor, transportation and/or operating costs;
more stable labor forces;
optimal access to transportation networks that enable efficient distribution;
and
Significant amounts of tenant funded capital improvements, such as
customized computer systems, information technology or cooling and refrigeration systems

 For example, distribution facilities, warehouses, manufacturing plants and corporate or regional headquarters are often considered to be necessity office and industrial properties. We believe that necessity office and industrial properties provide a relatively greater level of stability than other office and industrial property types because necessity properties typically involve long-term leases and experience relatively low tenant turnover. We also believe that, as a result of recent and ongoing business developments, such as the role of the internet in the distribution of products, globalization of importing and exporting products and consolidation of businesses requiring office buildings to accommodate a single tenant, there is, and we expect there will continue to be, increasing demand by commercial tenants for necessity office and industrial properties.
 
Our goal is to acquire a portfolio of commercial properties that are diversified by way of location and industry, in order to minimize the potential adverse impact of economic slow-downs or downturns in local markets or a specific industry. There is no limitation on the number, size or type of properties that we may acquire or on the percentage of net proceeds of the Offering that may be invested in a single property. The number and mix of properties comprising our portfolio will depend upon real estate market conditions and other circumstances existing at the time we acquire properties, and the amount of proceeds we raise in any debt or equity financing. We are not restricted to investments in commercial properties and we will not forgo a high quality investment because it does not precisely fit our expected portfolio composition.
 
We intend to incur debt to acquire properties. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire some properties without financing and later incur mortgage debt secured by one or more of such properties if favorable financing terms are available.
 Retail Real Estate Properties.

We expect the portion of our portfolio allocated to retail real estate properties will focus on regional or national name brand retail businesses with creditworthy and established track records. It is our present intention to hold substantially all of the retail properties that we acquire for a period in excess of five years. We will also pursue properties leased to tenants representing a variety of retail industries to avoid concentration in any one industry. These industries include all types of retail establishments, such as big box retailers, convenience stores, drug stores and restaurant properties. We expect that some of these investments will provide long-term value by virtue of their size, location, quality and condition, and lease characteristics.

We believe that focusing on the acquisition of single-tenant and multi-tenant necessity retail properties net leased to creditworthy tenants presents lower investment risks and greater stability than many other sectors of today’s commercial real estate market. By acquiring single-tenant and multi-tenant retail properties, we believe that lower than expected results of operations from one or a few investments will not necessarily preclude our ability to realize our investment objective of cash flow from our overall portfolio. We believe this approach can result in less risk to investors than an investment approach that targets other asset classes. In addition, we believe that retail properties under long-term triple net and double net leases offer a distinct investment advantage since these properties generally require less management and operating capital, have less recurring tenant turnover and, with respect to single tenant properties, often offer superior locations that are less dependent on the financial stability of adjoining tenants. In addition, since we intend to acquire properties that are geographically diverse, we expect to minimize the potential adverse impact of economic slowdowns or downturns in local markets.
 
Many retail companies today are entering into sale-leaseback arrangements as a strategy for applying capital that would otherwise be applied to their real estate holdings to their core operating businesses. We believe that our investment strategy will enable us to take advantage of the increased emphasis on retailers’ core business operations in today’s competitive corporate environment as many retailers attempt to divest from real estate assets.
 Office and Industrial Real Estate Properties.
 
We expect that our office properties will include recently constructed, high quality, low, mid- or high-rise office buildings that are necessary to a principal tenant, subject to a long-term net lease, and used for purposes such as a corporate, regional or product-specific headquarters. We also expect that our industrial property portfolio will include recently constructed, high quality industrial properties that are necessary to a single principal tenant, subject to a long-term net lease, and used for purposes such as warehousing, distribution, light manufacturing, research and development, or industrial flex facilities. It is our present intention to hold substantially all of the office and industrial properties that we acquire for a period of more than seven years.
 
Some of our office and industrial properties will be multi-tenant properties, anchored by one or more principal tenants, who are creditworthy and subject to long-term net leases. We expect that, from time to time, we may invest in corporate development projects, designed to construct an income producing office or industrial property to serve one or more creditworthy tenants.
 Real Estate Underwriting Process
 
In evaluating potential property acquisitions consistent with our investment objectives, we will apply established underwriting processes to determine the creditworthiness of potential tenants. Similarly, we will apply our credit underwriting criteria to possible new tenants when we are re-leasing properties in our portfolio. Our underwriting process may include analyzing the financial data and other available information about the tenant, such as income statements, balance sheets, net worth, cash flow, business plans, data provided by industry credit rating services, and/or other information we deem relevant. In addition, we may obtain guarantees of leases by the corporate parent of the tenant. In many instances, especially in sale-leaseback situations where we are acquiring a property from a company and simultaneously leasing it back to the company under a long-term lease, we will meet with the tenant’s senior management to discuss the company’s business plan and strategy.
Other Possible Commercial Real Estate Investments
 
Although we expect to invest primarily in necessity retail, office and industrial properties, we may also turn our attention to other real estate opportunities which may focus on investment in various aspects of the cannabis industry.
