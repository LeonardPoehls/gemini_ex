In the United States, we have sales and service offices in Dublin, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Birmingham, Alabama; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; New York, New York; Phoenix, Arizona; and Vancouver, Washington. Outside the United States, we have sales and service offices in Australia, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Serbia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. 

Sales. Our Enterprise direct sales force, which consist of account executives, technical pre-sales engineers and field management, is responsible for the sale of our products to global enterprises across multiple industries. Our Enterprise sales is organized along selected vertical industries and geographically to focus on market access. We also have an inside sales division that sells our learning, marketing and customer experience solutions to businesses of all sizes across all industries.
Marketing. Our marketing activities include product and customer marketing functions as well as marketing communications. The function of our product marketing is to define new product requirements, manage product life cycles, and generate content for sales collateral and marketing programs. The function of our customer marketing is to provide customer references and reviews and work with customers to produce case studies and testimonials. The function of our marketing communications is to focus on both primary demand generation efforts to increase awareness of sales effectiveness, product solutions and secondary demand generation efforts to drive sales leads for our solutions. This is done through multiple channels, including advertising, web casts, industry events, conferences, email marketing, web marketing and telemarketing. In addition, our corporate website is optimized to drive prospects to our Lead to Money solutions.
Alliances and Partnerships
We actively promote and maintain strategic relationships with systems integrators, consulting organizations, independent software vendors, value-added resellers, and technology providers. These relationships provide both customer referrals and co-marketing opportunities, which have contributed to the expansion of our customer base. We have established alliances with partners such as Accenture, Canidium, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Deloitte Consulting, OpenSymmetry, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Tata Consulting Services to service our customers nationally and internationally. We have also expanded our relationship with technology partners such as Docusign, Microsoft, NetSuite, Salesforce, SAP and Workday that collaborate with us in selling our solutions.
Competition
Our principal competition comes from Oracle, International Business Machines ("IBM") and the internally-developed software solutions deployed at potential customers. We also compete with other software and consulting companies, which typically focus on specific industries or sectors, including:

• | Sales: Apttus, IBM Varicent, Pros, SAVO Group and Xactly Corporation

•Marketing: Marketo, Oracle and Pardot
•Learning: Adobe Systems, Cornerstone On-demand, SABA Software and SumTotal Systems
•Customer Experience: Allegiance, GetFeedback and Medallia
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are:
•ability to offer a broad suite of solutions across the Lead to Money cycle;
•industry-specific domain expertise;
•scalability and flexibility of solutions;
•quality of customer service;
•functionality of solutions;
•total cost of ownership; and
7

•ease of use.
We believe that we compete effectively with other established enterprise software companies due to our broad suite of solutions beyond core commission management, established market leadership, domain expertise, and our highly scalable architecture. Furthermore, we believe we have developed the domain expertise necessary to meet the dynamic requirements of our customers' complex and growing sales performance and sales effectiveness programs.

We believe that our products offer customers a more cost-effective and more extensive alternative to their internally-developed solutions, which are generally expensive, inflexible and difficult to maintain, particularly for companies with increasingly complex sales performance programs and sales channels. We also believe that our suite of SaaS-based solutions for the spectrum of Lead-to-Market functions has advantages over multiple single-point solutions, including cost-effectiveness, ease of implementation and ease of use.
With respect to our offerings in specific industry verticals, we believe that we have developed breadth and depth of functionality demanded by those specific markets, and we have differentiated our products by adding features that are specific to each target market and that scale to growing business needs.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. While we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information and intellectual property, we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, product enhancements, and reliable product support are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position.
Our customer agreements include restrictions intended to protect and defend our intellectual property rights. We also require our employees, contractors and many others with whom we have business relationships to sign confidentiality agreements.
Some of our products include licensed third-party software, but we believe that such software is commercially available and that there are other commercially available substitutes that can be integrated with our products on reasonable terms. We also believe that in some cases, we could develop substitute technology to replace third-party software if the third-party licenses were no longer available on reasonable terms.
While our patents are an important part of our success, our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one patent or on a combination of any or all of our patents.
Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,113 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
Segment and Geographic Information
