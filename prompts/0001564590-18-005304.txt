References
 When referring to Amplify Energy Corp. (also referred to as “Successor,” “Amplify Energy,” or the “Company”), the intent is to refer to Amplify Energy, a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries as a whole or on an individual basis, depending on the context in which the statements are made. Amplify Energy is the successor reporting company of Memorial Production Partners LP (“MEMP”) pursuant to Rule 15d-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). When referring to “Predecessor” or the “Company” in reference to the period prior to the emergence from bankruptcy, the intent is to refer to MEMP, the predecessor that was dissolved following the effective date of the Plan (as defined below) and its consolidated subsidiaries as a whole or on an individual basis, depending on the context in which the statements are made.
Overview 
 Amplify Energy is an independent oil and natural gas company that was formed on March 21, 2017, in connection with the reorganization of the Predecessor. The Predecessor was publicly traded from December 2011 to May 2017. As discussed further in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, on January 16, 2017 (the “Petition Date”), MEMP and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively with MEMP, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions (the cases commenced thereby, the “Chapter 11 proceedings”) under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code” or “Chapter 11”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Debtors’ Chapter 11 proceedings were jointly administered under the caption In re Memorial Production Partners LP, et al. (Case No. 17-30262). During the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings, the Debtors operated their businesses as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The Company emerged from bankruptcy effective May 4, 2017 (the “Effective Date”).
 We operate in one reportable segment engaged in the acquisition, development, exploitation and production of oil and natural gas properties. Our management evaluates performance based on one reportable business segment, as the economic environments are not different within the operation of our oil and natural gas properties. Our business activities are conducted through OLLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Our assets consist primarily of producing oil and natural gas properties and are located in Texas, Louisiana, Wyoming and offshore Southern California. Most of our oil and natural gas properties are located in large, mature oil and natural gas reservoirs. The Company’s properties consist primarily of operated and non-operated working interests in producing and undeveloped leasehold acreage and working interests in identified producing wells. As of December 31, 2017: 
  
• | Our total estimated proved reserves were approximately 989.7 Bcfe, of which approximately 44% were oil and 71% were classified as proved developed reserves;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We produced from 2,547 gross (1,498 net) producing wells across our properties, with an average working interest of 59% and the Company is the operator of record of the properties containing 93% of our total estimated proved reserves; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our average net production for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 184.3 MMcfe/d, implying a reserve-to-production ratio of approximately 15 years.

Recent Developments
 Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11 
 On April 14, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the “Confirmation Order”) approving the Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization of Memorial Production Partners LP and its affiliated Debtors, dated April 13, 2017 (as amended and supplemented, the “Plan”).
 On the Effective Date, the Debtors satisfied the conditions to effectiveness of the Plan, the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms and the Company emerged from bankruptcy. Although the Company is no longer a debtor in possession, the Company was a debtor in possession from January 16, 2017 through May 4, 2017. As such, certain aspects of the Chapter 11 proceedings and related matters are described below in order to provide context to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations for the period presented.
 Upon emergence from the Chapter 11 proceedings on May 4, 2017, we adopted fresh start accounting as required by GAAP. We met the requirements of fresh start accounting, which include: (i) the holders of the Predecessor’s voting common units immediately prior to the Effective Date received less than 50% of the voting shares of the Company and (ii) the reorganization value of our assets immediately prior to the Effective Date was less than the post-petition liabilities and allowed claims.

In accordance with the Plan, on the Effective Date:
  
• | The Successor issued (i) 25,000,000 new shares (the “New Common Shares”) of its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“common stock”); and (ii) warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase up to 2,173,913 shares of the Company’s common stock exercisable for a five-year period commencing on the Effective Date entitling holders upon exercise thereof, on a pro rata basis, to 8% of the total issued and outstanding common shares (including common shares as of the Effective Date issuable upon full exercise of the Warrants, but excluding any common shares issuable under the Management Incentive Plan (the “MIP”)), at a per share exercise price of $42.60.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The holders of claims under the Predecessor’s revolving credit facility received a full recovery, consisting of a cash pay down and their pro rata share of the $1 billion exit senior secured reserve-based revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), as further discussed in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this annual report for additional information.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The 7.625% senior notes due May 2021 (“2021 Senior Notes”) and 6.875% senior notes due August 2022 (“2022 Senior Notes” and collectively, the “Notes”) were cancelled and the Predecessor’s liability thereunder discharged, and the holders of the Notes received (directly or indirectly) their pro rata share of New Common Shares representing, in the aggregate, 98% of the New Common Shares on the Effective Date (subject to dilution by the MIP and the common shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants). Additionally, the holders of the Notes received their pro rata share of a $24.6 million cash distribution.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Successor entered into a stockholders agreement with certain parties pursuant to which the Successor agreed to, at the direction of such stockholders, use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the sale of their common stock.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Successor entered into a registration rights agreement with certain parties pursuant to which the Successor agreed to, among other things, file a registration statement with the SEC within 90 days of the receipt of a request from the stockholders party thereto covering the offer and resale of the common stock held by such stockholders.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Company’s MIP became effective, such that an aggregate of 2,322,404 shares of the Company’s common stock became available for grant pursuant to awards under the MIP.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The term of the Predecessor’s general partner’s board of directors automatically expired on the Effective Date. The Successor formed a new seven-member board of directors consisting of the President and Chief Executive Officer, one director of the Predecessor, and five new members designated by certain parties to the plan support agreement.

Properties 
 We engaged Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (“Ryder Scott”), our independent reserve engineers, to audit our reserves estimates for all of our estimated proved reserves (by volume) at December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes information, based on a reserve report prepared by our internal reserve engineers and audited by Ryder Scott (which we refer to as our “reserve report”), about our proved oil and natural gas reserves by geographic region as of December 31, 2017 and our average net production for the three months ended December 31, 2017:

Our Areas of Operation 
 East Texas/Louisiana 
 Approximately 47% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 and approximately 58% of our average daily net production for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were located in the East Texas/Louisiana region. Our East Texas/Louisiana properties include wells and properties primarily located in the Joaquin, Carthage, Willow Springs and East Henderson fields in East Texas. Those properties collectively contained 460.3 Bcfe of estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 based on our reserve report and generated average net production of 106.3 MMcfe/d for the three months ended December 31, 2017. In October 2017, we launched a divestiture process for our assets in the East Texas/Louisiana region.
Rockies 
 Approximately 27% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 and approximately 15.0% of our average daily net production for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were located in the Rockies region. Our Rockies properties include wells and properties primarily located in the Lost Soldier and Wertz fields in Wyoming at our Bairoil complex. Our Rockies properties contained 44.0 MMBbls of estimated net proved oil and NGLs reserves as of December 31, 2017 based on our reserve report and generated average net production of 27.0 MMcfe/d for the three months ended December 31, 2017. In October 2017, we launched a divestiture process for our assets in the Rockies region.
California 
 Approximately 18% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 and approximately 13% of our average daily net production for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were located offshore Southern California. These properties (the “Beta properties”) consist of: 100% of the working interests and currently an 87.6% average net revenue interest in three Pacific Outer Continental Shelf lease blocks (P-0300, P-0301 and P-0306), referred to as the Beta Unit, in the Beta Field located in federal waters approximately 11 miles offshore the Port of Long Beach, California. Our Beta properties contained 29.4 MMBbls of estimated net proved oil reserves as of December 31, 2017 based on our reserve report. Oil and gas is produced from the Beta Unit via two production platforms, referred to as the Ellen and Eureka platforms, equipped with permanent drilling rigs and associated equipment systems. On a third platform, Elly, the oil, water and gas are separated and the oil is prepared for sale, while the gas is burned as fuel for power and the water is recycled back into the reservoir for pressure maintenance. Sales quality oil is then pumped from the Elly platform to the Beta pump station located onshore at the Port of Long Beach, California via a 16-inch diameter oil pipeline, which extends approximately 17.5 miles. Amplify Energy’s wholly owned subsidiary, San Pedro Bay Pipeline Company, owns and operates the pipeline system.
 Based on our reserve report, the Beta field contains more than 15% of our total estimated reserves. The following table summarizes production volumes from this field for the periods presented:
 
 
 | Period from | | Period from | | | 
---------------------------------+-------------------+-------+-----------------+-----+--------------------+------
 | May 5, 2017 | | January 1, 2017 | | For the Year Ended
 | through | | through | | December 31, 
 | December 31, 2017 | | May 4, 2017 | | 2016 | 2015 
Production Volumes: | | | | | | | 
Oil (MBbls) | | 1,022 | | 486 | | 1,445 | 860
Average net production (MBbls/d) | | 4.2 | | 3.9 | | 3.9 | 2.4

 The increase in the production volumes between 2015 and the subsequent periods is primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining interests in our Beta properties from a third party.
 Due to low oil and gas prices, the Beta leases were all granted royalty relief by the U.S. Department of Interior in July 2016. On our two primary producing leases, the royalty rate was reduced from 25% to 12.5%, and on our third lease, the royalty rate was reduced from 16.67% to 8.33%, for a weighted average of 12.4% overall. The royalty relief rates will apply to all hydrocarbon production up to 165,801 Boe per month. Monthly production above that level and up to 331,602 Boe per month will bear royalties at 1.5 times the original effective royalty rate. For monthly production above 331,602 Boe per month, the royalty rate will return to the original effective royalty rates. The royalty relief rates will also be suspended in months in which the trailing twelve-month weighted average NYMEX oil and Henry Hub gas price exceeds $55.16 per Boe which represents a 25% premium to the average realized price recognized by the Company during the qualification period. The royalty relief would end in the event that the Company generates no benefit from the royalty relief rates due to either higher production or realized pricing for 12 consecutive months.

South Texas 
 Approximately 9% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 and approximately 14% of our average daily net production for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were located in the South Texas region. Our South Texas properties include wells and properties in numerous fields located primarily in the Eagle Ford, Eagleville, NE Thompsonville, Laredo and East Seven Sisters fields. Our South Texas properties contained 88.6 Bcfe of estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 based on our reserve report. Those properties collectively generated average net production of 25.6 MMcfe/d for the three months ended December 31, 2017. In July 2017, we launched a divestiture process for our assets in the South Texas region.
Our Oil and Natural Gas Data 
 Our Reserves 
 Internal Controls. Our proved reserves were estimated at the well or unit level and audited for reporting purposes by Ryder Scott, our independent reserve engineers. The Company maintains internal evaluations of our reserves in a secure reserve engineering database. Ryder Scott interacts with the Company’s internal petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals in each of our operating areas and with operating, accounting and marketing employees to obtain the necessary data for the reserves audit process. Reserves are reviewed and approved internally by our senior management on an annual basis and evaluated by our lender group on at least a semi-annual basis in connection with borrowing base redeterminations under our Credit Facility. Our reserve estimates are audited by Ryder Scott at least annually.
Our internal professional staff works closely with Ryder Scott to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data that is furnished to them for their reserve audit process. All of the reserve information maintained in our secure reserve engineering database is provided to the external engineers.

(2) | Standardized measure is the present value of estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves, determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC without giving effect to non-property related expenses, such as general and administrative expenses, interest expense, or to depletion, depreciation and amortization. The future cash flows are discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. Standardized measure does not give effect to derivative transactions. For a description of our commodity derivative contracts, see “Item 1. Business—Operations—Derivative Activities” as well as “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Commodity Derivative Contracts.”

(3) | Our estimated net proved reserves and related standardized measure were determined using 12-month trailing average oil and natural gas index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in effect as of the date of the estimate, without giving effect to derivative contracts, held constant throughout the life of the properties. These prices were adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead.

 The data in the table above represents estimates only. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured exactly. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Accordingly, reserve estimates may vary from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. For a discussion of risks associated with internal reserve estimates, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Our estimated proved reserves and future production rates are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our estimated reserves.” 
 Future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. The standardized measure shown above should not be construed as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate standardized measure, which is required by the SEC and FASB, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate. 
 Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 282.3 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves comprised of 22.0 MMBbls of oil, 107.1 Bcfe of natural gas and 7 MMBbls of NGLs. None of our PUDs as of December 31, 2017 are scheduled to be developed on a date more than five years from the date the reserves were initially booked as PUDs. PUDs will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production.
 Changes in PUDs that occurred during 2017 were due to:
  
• | Upward performance and price revisions of 46 Bcfe;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | Reclassifications of 20 Bcfe into proved developed reserves as wells are drilled, completed and turned to production; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reserve additions of 6 Bcfe.
--+-----------------------------

 13

Approximately 8% (20 Bcfe) of our PUDs recorded as of December 31, 2016 were developed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Total costs incurred to develop these PUDs were approximately $30.5 million, of which $0.8 million was incurred in fiscal year 2016 and $29.7 million was incurred in fiscal year 2017. In total, we incurred total capital expenditures of approximately $41.5 million during fiscal year 2017 developing PUDs, which includes $11.7 million associated with PUDs to be completed in 2018. As we continue to develop our properties and have more well production and completion data, we believe we will continue to realize cost savings and experience lower relative drilling and completion costs as we convert PUDs into proved developed reserves in the upcoming years. Based on our current expectations of our cash flows, we believe that we can fund the drilling of our current PUD inventory and our expansions in the next five years from our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility. For a more detailed discussion of our liquidity position, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Drilling Activities 
 Our drilling activities primarily consist of development wells. The following table sets forth information with respect to wells drilled and completed by us or the previous owners during the periods indicated. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should a correlation be assumed between the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value. At December 31, 2017, 13 gross (3.6 net) wells were in various stages of completion.

Delivery Commitments 
 We have no commitments to deliver a fixed and determinable quantity of our oil or natural gas production in the near future under our existing sales contracts.
 16

We have entered into a long-term gas gathering agreement associated with a certain portion of our East Texas production with a third party midstream service provider that has volumetric requirements. Information regarding our delivery commitments under this contract is contained in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Contractual Obligations” and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” both contained herein.
 Operations 
 General 
 As of December 31, 2017, the Company is the operator of record of properties containing 93% of our total estimated proved reserves. We design and manage the development, recompletion and/or workover operations, and supervise other operation and maintenance activities, for all of the wells we operate. We do not own the drilling rigs or other oil field services equipment used for drilling or maintaining wells on our onshore properties; independent contractors provide all the equipment and personnel associated with these activities. Our Beta platforms have permanent drilling systems in place. 
Marketing and Major Customers 
 The following individual customers each accounted for 10% or more of our total reported revenues for the period indicated:

Major customers: | | | | 
Phillips 66 | 23% | 19% | 19% | 12% 
Sinclair Oil & Gas Company | 19% | 20% | 16% | 18% 
CIMA Energy | 11% | n/a | n/a | n/a 
BP America Production Company | 10% | 10% | n/a | n/a 
Royal Dutch Shell plc and subsidiaries | n/a | n/a | 14% | 14% 

 The production sales agreements covering our properties contain customary terms and conditions for the oil and natural gas industry and provide for sales based on prevailing market prices. A majority of those agreements have terms that renew on a month-to-month basis until either party gives advance written notice of termination.
 If we were to lose any one of our customers, the loss could temporarily delay production and sale of a portion of our oil and natural gas in the related producing region. If we were to lose any single customer, we believe we could identify a substitute customer to purchase the impacted production volumes. However, if one or more of our larger customers ceased purchasing oil or natural gas altogether and we were unable to replace them, the loss of any such customer could have a detrimental effect on our production volumes and revenues in general. 
 Title to Properties 
 We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. As is customary in the industry, in the case of undeveloped properties, often cursory investigation of record title is made at the time of lease acquisition. More thorough title investigations are customarily made before the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. Individual properties may be subject to burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect the value of the properties. Burdens on properties may include customary royalty interests, liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes, obligations or duties under applicable laws, development obligations under natural gas leases, or net profits interests.
Derivative Activities 
 We enter into commodity derivative contracts with unaffiliated third parties, generally lenders under our Credit Facility or their affiliates, to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. Our outstanding commodity derivative contracts currently consist of floating-for-fixed swaps. We intend to enter into commodity derivative contracts at times and on terms desired to maintain a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts covering at least 75% of our estimated production from total proved developed producing reserves over a one-to-three year period at any given point of time to satisfy the hedging covenants in our Credit Facility and pursuant to our internal policies. We may, however, from time to time, hedge more or less than this approximate amount.
 Periodically, we enter into interest rate swaps to mitigate exposure to market rate fluctuations by converting variable interest rates (such as those in our revolving credit facility) to fixed interest rates. 
 17

It is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with creditworthy counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers. Some of the lenders, or certain of their affiliates, under our Credit Facility are counterparties to our derivative contracts. We will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future. See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for additional information. 
 Competition 
 We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, leasing acreage, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects, as well as evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to find and develop reserves will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry and many of our competitors have access to capital at a lower cost than that available to us. 
Seasonal Nature of Business 
 The price we receive for our natural gas production is impacted by seasonal fluctuations in demand for natural gas. The demand for natural gas typically peaks during the coldest months and tapers off during the milder months, with a slight increase during the summer to meet the demands of electric generators. The weather during any particular season can affect this cyclical demand for natural gas. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers can lessen or intensify this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. 
Hydraulic Fracturing
 We use hydraulic fracturing as a means to maximize the productivity of almost every well that we drill and complete, except in our offshore wells. Hydraulic fracturing is a necessary part of the completion process because our properties are dependent upon our ability to effectively fracture the producing formations in order to produce at economic rates. Our proved non-producing and proved undeveloped reserves make up 36% of the proved reserves with approximately 68% of these requiring hydraulic fracturing as of December 31, 2017. 
 We have and continue to follow applicable industry standard practices and legal and regulatory requirements for groundwater protection in our operations which are subject to supervision by state and federal regulators (including the Bureau of Land Management on federal acreage). These protective measures include setting surface casing at a depth sufficient to protect fresh water zones as determined by regulatory agencies and cementing the well to create a permanent isolating barrier between the casing pipe and surrounding geological formations. This aspect of well design essentially eliminates a pathway for the fracturing fluid to contact any aquifers during the hydraulic fracturing operations. For recompletions of existing wells, the production casing is pressure tested prior to perforating the new completion interval. 
 Injection rates and pressures are monitored instantaneously and in real time at the surface during our hydraulic fracturing operations. Pressure is monitored on both the injection string and the immediate annulus to the injection string. Hydraulic fracturing operations would be shut down immediately if an abnormal change occurred to the injection pressure or annular pressure. 
 Certain state regulations require disclosure of the components in the solutions used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Approximately 99% of the hydraulic fracturing fluids we use are made up of water and sand. The remainder of the constituents in the fracturing fluid are managed and used in accordance with applicable requirements. 
 Hydraulic fracture stimulation requires the use of a significant volume of water. Upon flowback of the water, we dispose of it in a way that minimizes the impact to nearby surface water by disposing into approved disposal or injection wells. We currently do not discharge water to the surface. 
 For information regarding existing and proposed governmental regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters, see “—Environmental, Occupational Health and Safety Matters and Regulations—Hydraulic Fracturing.”
 Insurance 
 In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against many potential operational risks and losses that could be covered by the following policies: 
 
 
• Commercial General Liability; | • Oil Pollution Act Liability; 
-------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------
• Primary Umbrella / Excess Liability; | • Pollution Legal Liability; 
• Property; | • Charterer’s Legal Liability; 
• Workers’ Compensation; | • Non-Owned Aircraft Liability; 
• Employer’s Liability; | • Automobile Liability; 
• Maritime Employer’s Liability; | • Directors & Officers Liability; 

 18

 
• U.S. Longshore and Harbor Workers’; | • Employment Practices Liability; 
-------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------
• Energy Package/Control of Well; | • Crime; and 
• Loss of Production Income (offshore only); | • Fiduciary. 

 Onshore and Offshore Insurance Program. We maintain insurance coverage against potential losses that we believe is customary in the industry. As of December 31, 2017, we maintain commercial general liability insurance, automobile liability insurance and umbrella/excess liability insurance. Our commercial general liability insurance has limits of $1.0 million per occurrence/$2.0 million in the aggregate and a $100,000 self-insured retention (except $250,000 with respect to Pollution Clean Up Costs). Our general liability insurance covers us for, among other things, legal and contractual liabilities arising out of third party property damage and bodily injury and for sudden and accidental pollution liability. Our automobile liability insurance has limits of $1.0 million per occurrence. Our umbrella/excess liability limits for each occurrence is a minimum of $25.0 million. There is no deductible on our umbrella/excess liability insurance. Our umbrella/excess liability insurance is in addition to our general and automobile liability policy and may be triggered if the general or automobile liability insurance policy limits are exceeded and exhausted. In addition, we maintain an energy package policy that includes control of well coverage (“COW”) with per occurrence limits for COW ranging from $10.0 million to $100.0 million and retentions ranging from $100,000 to $500,000, with an additional annual aggregate retention of $1.0 million. Specific to offshore operations, the energy package policy also includes loss of production income coverage insuring us against a loss up to $52.65 million due to a temporary interruption in the oil supply from our offshore facilities as a result of an insured physical loss to our offshore facilities. Our control of well policy insures us for blowout risks associated with drilling, completing and operating our wells. We maintain two separate Pollution Legal Liability (“PLL”) policies, one for all U.S. onshore operations, excluding California and one for California only. Our PLL non-California insurance policy has limits of $10.0 million per pollution event with a $1.0 million retention. Our PLL California-only insurance policy has limits of $10.0 million with a $250,000 retention. 
 As of December 31, 2017, we have insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for pollution losses including those related to our hydraulic fracturing operations. These policies may not cover fines, penalties or costs and expenses related to government-mandated clean-up of pollution. In addition, these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover claims that may arise and we may be unable to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
 We enter into master services agreements (“MSAs”) with various service providers. These MSAs allocate potential liabilities and risks between the parties. Under certain MSAs, we indemnify certain service providers, including hydraulic fracturing service providers, for pollution and contamination of any kind, damages to or losses from wells or underground formations and damages to property, including pipelines, storage or production facilities. Under certain other MSAs, the service providers indemnify us for pollution or contamination that originates above the surface and is caused by the service provider’s equipment or services, unless such pollution or contamination is caused by our gross negligence or willful misconduct and we indemnify the service providers for all other pollution or contamination that may occur during operations (including that which may result from seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of oil, natural gas or other fluids from the well), unless such pollution or contamination is caused by the service provider’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Generally, we also agree to indemnify the service providers against claims arising from our employees’ bodily injury or death to the extent that our employees are injured by or during service operations, unless resulting from the service provider’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Similarly, the service providers generally agree to indemnify us for liabilities arising from bodily injury to or death of any of their employees, unless resulting from our gross negligence or willful misconduct. In addition, the service providers generally agree to indemnify us for loss or destruction of property or equipment that they own, unless resulting from our gross negligence or willful misconduct. In turn, we generally agree to indemnify the service providers for loss or destruction of property or equipment we own, unless resulting from the service provider’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. 
 Despite the general allocation of risk discussed above, we may not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation of risk, we may be required to enter into a MSA with terms that vary from such allocation of risk and may incur costs or liabilities that fall outside any contractual allocation of risk. As a result, we may incur substantial losses that could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Environmental, Occupational Health and Safety Matters and Regulations 
 General 
 Our oil and natural gas development and production operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations including the acquisition of a permit before conducting regulated drilling activities; the restriction of types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, seismically active areas and other protected areas; the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly compliance or corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and in some instances, the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue. 
 Under certain environmental laws that impose strict as well as joint and several liability, we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment has increased in recent years. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the crude oil and natural gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating, waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, occupational health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position. 
 BOEM & BSEE 
 Our oil and gas operations associated with our Beta properties are conducted on offshore leases in federal waters. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”) have broad authority to regulate our oil and gas operations associated with our Beta properties. 
 BOEM is responsible for managing environmentally and economically responsible development of the nation’s offshore resources. Its functions include offshore leasing, resource evaluation, review and administration of oil and gas exploration and development plans, renewable energy development, National Environmental Policy Act analysis and environmental studies. Lessees must obtain BOEM approval for exploration, development and production plans prior to the commencement of offshore operations. In addition, approvals and permits are required from other agencies such as the U.S. Coast Guard, the EPA, U.S. Department of Transportation and the South Coast Air Quality Management District. BOEM generally requires that lessees have substantial net worth, post supplemental bonds or provide other acceptable assurances that the obligations will be met. In July 2016, BOEM issued updated guidance for determining if and when additional security is required for Outer Continental Shelf (“OCS”) leases, pipeline rights-of-way and rights-of-use and easement. The new criteria may require lessees or operators to take additional steps to demonstrate that they have the financial ability to carry out their obligations. In June 2017, BOEM announced that the implementation timeline would be extended, except in circumstances where there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder’s obligations.
 BSEE is responsible for safety and environmental oversight of offshore oil and gas operations. Its functions include the development and enforcement of safety and environmental regulations, permitting offshore exploration, development and production, inspections, offshore regulatory programs, oil spill response and newly formed training and environmental compliance programs. BSEE regulations require offshore production facilities and pipelines located on the OCS to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications, and BSEE has proposed and/or promulgated additional safety-related regulations concerning the design and operating procedures of these facilities and pipelines, including regulations to safeguard against or respond to well blowouts and other catastrophes. BSEE regulations also restrict the flaring or venting of natural gas, prohibit the flaring of liquid hydrocarbons and govern the plugging and abandonment of wells located offshore and the installation and removal of all fixed drilling and production facilities. 
 20

BOEM and BSEE have adopted regulations providing for enforcement actions, including civil penalties and lease forfeiture or cancellation for failure to comply with regulatory requirements for offshore operations. If we fail to pay royalties or comply with safety and environmental regulations, BOEM and BSEE may require that our operations on the Beta properties be suspended or terminated and we may be subject to civil or criminal liability. 
 In January 2016, BOEM and BSEE entered into a settlement agreement with environmental groups promising to study the potential environmental impacts of well-stimulation practices on the Pacific OCS, including hydraulic fracturing and acid well stimulation. The study was completed in May 2016, finding no significant impact from these activities. While BSEE has resumed its review of permit applications involving hydraulic fracturing operations or acid well stimulation on the Pacific OCS, the State of California and environmental groups filed lawsuits in December 2016 challenging the environmental study, which, if successful, could delay or restrict the issuance of permits involving hydraulic fracturing and/or acid well stimulation. Although we do not use either hydraulic fracturing or acid stimulation routinely, delays in the approval or refusal of plans and issuance of permits by BOEM or BSEE because of staffing, economic, environmental or other reasons (or other actions taken by BOEM or BSEE) could adversely affect our offshore operations. The requirements imposed by BOEM and BSEE regulations are frequently changed and subject to new interpretations.

 Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid and hazardous wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict and, in some cases, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law and comparable state laws, impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons deemed “responsible parties.” These persons include current owners or operators of the site where a release of hazardous substances occurred, prior owners or operators that owned or operated the site at the time of the release or disposal of hazardous substances and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file common law-based claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. Despite the “petroleum exclusion” of Section 101(14) of CERCLA, which currently encompasses natural gas, we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. Also, comparable state statutes may not contain a similar exemption for petroleum. In addition, we may have liability for releases of hazardous substances at our properties by prior owners or operators or other third parties. 
 The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) is the primary federal law imposing oil spill liability. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the United States, including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs. Under the OPA, strict, joint and several liability may be imposed on “responsible parties” for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters and natural resource damages resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. A “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility. The OPA establishes a liability limit for onshore facilities, but these liability limits may not apply if: a spill is caused by a party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; the spill resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation; or a party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up. We are also subject to analogous state statutes that impose liabilities with respect to oil spills. For example, the California Department of Fish and Game's Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response have adopted oil-spill prevention regulations that overlap with federal regulations.
 21

We also generate solid wastes, including hazardous wastes, which are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes. Although RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes stringent requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Certain petroleum production wastes are excluded from RCRA’s hazardous waste regulations. These wastes, instead, are regulated under RCRA's less stringent solid waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. It is possible that these wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, could be designated as “hazardous wastes” in the future and, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes.” Also, in December 2016, the EPA entered into a consent decree requiring it to review its regulation of oil and gas waste. The consent decree requires the EPA to determine whether any revisions are necessary by March 2019. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses. 
 It is possible that our oil and natural gas operations may require us to manage naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”). NORM is present in varying concentrations in sub-surface formations, including hydrocarbon reservoirs, and may become concentrated in scale, film and sludge in equipment that comes in contact with crude oil and natural gas production and processing streams. Some states have enacted regulations governing the handling, treatment, storage and disposal of NORM. 
 Administrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the requirements of CERCLA, RCRA, OPA and related state and local laws and regulations, and that we hold all necessary and up-to-date permits, registrations and other authorizations required under such laws and regulations. Although we believe that the current costs of managing our wastes as they are presently classified are reflected in our budget, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes. 
 Water Discharges and Other Waste Discharges & Spills
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the Clean Water Act), the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), the OPA and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including oil and hazardous substances, into navigable waters of the United States, as well as state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. These laws and regulations also prohibit certain activity in wetlands unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”). In June 2015, the EPA and the Corps issued a rule to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”) for all Clean Water Act programs. In October 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stayed the rule revising the WOTUS definition nationwide pending further action of the court. In response to this decision, the EPA and the Corps resumed nationwide use of the agencies’ prior regulations defining the term “waters of the United States.” However, in January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the rule revising the WOTUS definition must first be reviewed in the federal district courts, which could result in a withdrawal of the stay by the Sixth Circuit. In addition, the EPA has proposed to repeal the rule revising the WOTUS definition, and in January 2018 the EPA released a final rule that delays implementation of the rule revising the WOTUS definition until 2020 to allow time for EPA to reconsider the definition of the term “waters of the United States.” Several states and environmental groups have since filed lawsuits challenging the delay rule. To the extent the rule revising the definition of WOTUS is implemented, it could significantly expand federal control of land and water resources across the United States and lead to substantial additional permitting and regulatory requirements.
 The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. The underground injection of fluids is subject to permitting and other requirements under state laws and regulation. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of natural gas and oil projects. These same regulatory programs also limit the total volume of water that can be discharged, hence limiting the rate of development and require us to incur compliance costs. 
 These laws and any implementing regulations provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other substances in reportable quantities and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and the underground injection of fluids and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure (“SPCC”) plans, in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. We maintain all required discharge permits necessary to conduct our operations and we believe we are in substantial compliance with their terms. 
 22

Hydraulic Fracturing 
 We use hydraulic fracturing extensively in our onshore operations, but not our offshore operations. Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from low permeability subsurface rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. While hydraulic fracturing has historically been regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, the practice has become increasingly controversial in certain parts of the country, resulting in increased scrutiny and regulation. For example, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic-fracturing activities under the SDWA involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the use of diesel in fracturing operations. In addition, the EPA plans to develop a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which would describe a proposed mechanism – regulatory, voluntary, or a combination of both – to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”). Also, in June 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants; for certain facilities, compliance is required by August 2018. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities, also known as centralized waste treatment (“CWT”) facilities, accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities. 
 Further, in August 2012, the EPA published final rules that subject all oil and gas operations (production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution) to regulation under the new source performance standards (“NSPS”) and the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) programs. The rules include NSPS for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells and establishes specific new requirements for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage vessels, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. The final rules seek to achieve a 95% reduction in volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulically-fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The rules could require a number of modifications to our operations including the installation of new equipment. In May 2016, the EPA amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and VOC emissions for certain new, modified and reconstructed equipment, processes and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. Although these standards currently remain in effect, EPA proposed in June 2017 to stay certain requirements for two years while it reconsiders the entirety of the standards. The EPA also finalized a plan in May 2016 to implement its minor new source review program on Indian lands for oil and natural gas production. These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Compliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business. 
 In addition, in March 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, implementation of a casing and cementing program, management of recovered fluids and submission to the BLM of detailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures and the depths of all usable water. Following years of litigation, the BLM rescinded the rule in December 2017. However, the State of California and environmental groups filed lawsuits in January 2018 challenging BLM’s rescission of the rule. Also, in November 2016, the BLM finalized a rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and gas operations on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires operators to use currently available technologies and equipment to reduce flaring, periodically inspect their operations for leaks and replace outdated equipment that vents large quantities of gas into the air. The rule also clarified when operators owe the government royalties for flared gas. In December 2017, BLM suspended certain requirements of the rule until 2019. However, the States of California and New Mexico and environmental groups filed lawsuits in December 2017 challenging BLM’s suspension of the rule.
 23

Several states have also adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations requiring the disclosure of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and/or otherwise impose additional requirements for hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, in October 2011, the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources adopted rules requiring the public disclosure of the composition and volume of fracturing fluids used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Also, Texas requires oil and natural gas operators to disclose to the Railroad Commission of Texas (“Commission”) and the public the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process, as well as the total volume of water used. Also, in May 2013, the Commission issued a “well integrity rule,” which updates the requirements for drilling, putting pipe down and cementing wells. The rule also includes new testing and reporting requirements, such as (i) the requirement to submit cementing reports after well completion or after cessation of drilling, and (ii) the imposition of additional testing on wells less than 1,000 feet below usable groundwater. The “well integrity rule” took effect in January 2014. Additionally, in October 2014, the Commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, among other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed, new disposal well. The disposal well rule amendments, which became effective in November 2014, also clarify the Commission’s authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The Commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. 
 Certain governmental reviews have been conducted that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices, which could lead to increased regulation. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, in February 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. In addition, as discussed above, BOEM and BSEE completed a study in May 2016 regarding the potential environmental impacts of well-stimulation practices on the Pacific OCS. These studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business. 
 A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country alleging that hydraulic fracturing practices have induced seismic activity and adversely impacted drinking water supplies, use of surface water, and the environment generally. Several states and municipalities have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. In the event state or local legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting, or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling of wells. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. 
 In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal, state or local level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. For example, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to amend the SDWA, including legislation that would repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process. Such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing, and any of the above risks could impair our ability to manage our business and have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.

Air Emissions 
 The federal Clean Air Act, as amended (“CAA”), and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including compressor stations, through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues. For example, in August 2012, the EPA published final regulations under the CAA that establish new emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations, which regulations are discussed in more detail above under the caption “Hydraulic Fracturing.” In May 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements. In addition, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion in October 2015 and has announced that it intends to complete most initial area designations under the standard by April 2018. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements or delay and increased expenditures for air pollution control equipment.
 The South Coast Air Quality Management District (“SCAQMD”) is a regulatory subdivision of the State of California and responsible for air pollution control from stationary sources within Orange County and designated portions of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties. Our Beta properties and associated facilities are subject to regulation by the SCAQMD.
 We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next few years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits addressing air emission related issues, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations. Obtaining permits also has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. We believe that we currently are in substantial compliance with all air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our current operations. 
 Regulation of “Greenhouse Gas” Emissions
 In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted and implemented regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. In addition, in September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States, including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gas/distribution companies, beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. In November 2010, the EPA published a final rule expanding the GHG reporting rule to include onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. This rule requires reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities on an annual basis, with reporting beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. In October 2015, the EPA amended the GHG reporting rule to add the reporting of GHG emissions from gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines. The adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. Such climate change regulatory and legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, almost one-half of the states have taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. In addition, in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP-21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit increase in the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016 and establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions. However, in June 2017, the United States announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, although the earliest possible effective date of withdrawal is November 2020. Despite the planned withdrawal, certain U.S. city and state governments have announced their intention to satisfy their proportionate obligations under the Paris Agreement.
 Restrictions on GHG emissions that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry. Any GHG regulation could increase our costs of compliance by potentially delaying the receipt of permits and other regulatory approvals; requiring us to monitor emissions, install additional equipment or modify facilities to reduce GHG and other emissions; purchase emission credits; and utilize electric driven compression at facilities to obtain regulatory permits and approvals in a timely manner. While we are subject to certain federal GHG monitoring and reporting requirements, our operations are not adversely impacted by existing federal, state and local climate change initiatives and, at this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business. 
 25

In addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or property damages. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Finally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our development and production operations. 
 National Environmental Policy Act 
 Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the U.S. Departments of Interior and Agriculture, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency prepares an environmental assessment to evaluate the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project. If impacts are considered significant, the agency will prepare a more detailed environmental impact study that is made available for public review and comment. All of our current development and production activities, as well as proposed development plans, on federal lands, including those in the Pacific Ocean, require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This environmental impact assessment process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA also are subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which can delay or halt projects.
Endangered Species Act 
 The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and analogous state statutes restrict activities that may adversely affect endangered and threatened species or their habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species in areas where we operate could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans. Numerous species have been listed or proposed for protected status in areas in which we currently, or could in the future, undertake operations. The presence of protected species in areas where we operate could impair our ability to timely complete or carry out those operations, lose leaseholds as we may not be permitted to timely commence drilling operations, cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures, and, consequently, adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
Occupational Safety and Health Act 
 We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements.
Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry 
 The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden on our assets. Additionally, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the oil and natural gas industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production. 
 Legislation continues to be introduced in Congress, and the development of regulations continues in the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies concerning the security of industrial facilities, including oil and natural gas facilities. Our operations may be subject to such laws and regulations. Presently, it is not possible to accurately estimate the costs we could incur to comply with any such facility security laws or regulations, but such expenditures could be substantial.
 Drilling and Production 
 Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at federal, state and local levels. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties and municipalities, in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following: 

• | the location of wells;
--+-----------------------


• | the method of drilling and casing wells;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 26

 
• | the plugging and abandoning of wells;
--+--------------------------------------


• | transportation of materials and equipment to and from our well sites and facilities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | transportation and disposal of produced fluids and natural gas; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | notice to surface owners and other third parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------

 State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration, while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction. 
 Sale and Transportation of Gas and Oil 
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) approves the construction of interstate gas pipelines and the rates and service conditions for the interstate transportation of gas, oil and other liquids by pipeline. Although the FERC does not regulate the production of gas, the FERC exercises regulatory authority over wholesale sales of gas in interstate commerce through the issuance of blanket marketing certificates that authorize the wholesale sale of gas at market rates and the imposition of a code of conduct on blanket marketing certificate holders that regulate certain affiliate interactions. The FERC does not regulate the sale of oil or petroleum products or the construction of oil or other liquids pipelines. The FERC also has oversight of the performance of wholesale natural gas markets, including the authority to facilitate price transparency and to prevent market manipulation. In furtherance of this authority, the FERC imposed an annual reporting requirement on all industry participants, including otherwise non-jurisdictional entities, engaged in wholesale physical natural gas sales and purchases in excess of a minimum level. The agency’s actions are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the gas industry. To date, the FERC’s pro-competition policies have not materially affected our business or operations. It is unclear what impact, if any, future rules or increased competition within the gas industry will have on our gas sales efforts. 
 The FERC and other federal agencies, the U.S. Congress or state legislative bodies and regulatory agencies may consider additional proposals or proceedings that might affect the gas or oil industries. We cannot predict when or if these proposals will become effective or any effect they may have on our operations. We do not believe, however, that any of these proposals will affect us any differently than other gas producers with which we compete. 
 The Beta properties include the San Pedro Bay Pipeline Company, which owns and operates an offshore crude pipeline. This pipeline is subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”) and the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Tariff rates for liquids pipelines, which include both crude oil pipelines and refined products pipelines, must be just and reasonable and non-discriminatory. FERC regulations require that interstate oil pipeline transportation rates and terms of service be filed with the FERC and posted publicly. The FERC has established a formulaic methodology for petroleum pipelines to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index. The FERC reviews the formula every five years. Effective July 1, 2016, the current index for the five-year period ending July 2021 is the producer price index for finished goods plus an adjustment factor of 1.23 percent. The San Pedro Bay Pipeline Company uses the indexing methodology to change its rates. 
 The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act requires that all pipelines operating on or across the OCS provide open access, non-discriminatory transportation service. BOEM/BSEE has established formal and informal complaint procedures for shippers that believe that have been denied open and nondiscriminatory access to transportation on the OCS. 
 27

The U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) regulates all pipeline transportation in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, including pipeline facilities on the OCS. The San Pedro Bay pipeline is subject to regulation by the PHMSA. The PHMSA has also proposed additional regulations for gas pipeline safety. For example, in March 2016, the PHMSA proposed a rule that, if adopted, would expand integrity management requirements beyond high consequence areas (“HCAs”), which are areas where a release could have the most significant adverse consequences, including high-population areas, certain drinking water sources and unusually sensitive ecological areas, to apply to gas pipelines in newly defined “moderate consequence areas” that contain as few as five dwellings within the potential impact area. Many gas pipelines that were in place before 1970, and thus grandfathered from certain pressure testing obligations, would be required to be pressure tested to determine their maximum allowable operating pressures. Many gathering lines in rural areas that are currently not regulated at the federal level would also be covered by this proposal. More recently, in January 2017, the PHMSA finalized new regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines that significantly extend and expand the reach of certain PHMSA integrity management requirements (i.e., periodic assessments, repairs and leak detection), regardless of the pipeline’s proximity to an HCA. The final rule also requires all pipelines in or affecting an HCA to be capable of accommodating in-line inspection tools within the next 20 years. In addition, the final rule extends annual and accident reporting requirements to gravity lines and all gathering lines and also imposes inspection requirements on pipelines in areas affected by extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, landslides, floods, earthquakes, or other similar events that are likely to damage infrastructure. The timing for implementation of this rule is uncertain at this time due to the change in presidential administrations.
 Moreover, effective April 2017, the PHMSA adopted new rules increasing the maximum administrative civil penalties for violation of the pipeline safety laws and regulations to up to $209,002 per violation per day and up to $2,090,022 for a related series of violations. Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to pipeline safety that require the use of new or more stringent safety controls or result in more stringent enforcement of applicable legal requirements could subject us to increased capital costs, operational delays and costs of operation.
 Anti-Market Manipulation Laws and Regulations 
 The FERC with respect to the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transmission or transportation services subject to FERC jurisdiction, the Federal Trade Commission with respect to petroleum and petroleum products, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission with respect to commodity and futures markets, operating under various statutes have each adopted anti-market manipulation regulations, which prohibit, among other things, fraud and price manipulation in the respective markets. These agencies hold substantial enforcement authority, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties, to order disgorgement of profits and to recommend criminal penalties. Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities. 
 State Regulation 
 Various states regulate the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. For example, the baseline Texas severance tax on oil and gas is 4.6% of the market value of oil produced and 7.5% of the market value of gas produced and saved. A number of exemptions from or reductions of the severance tax on oil and gas production is provided by the State of Texas which effectively lowers the cost of production. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowable from natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill. 
 The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.
