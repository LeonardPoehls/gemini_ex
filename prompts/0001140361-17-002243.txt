Item 1 – 
Business
 
Overview
 
ERHC Energy Inc., a Colorado corporation, (“ERHC” or the “Company”) was incorporated in 1986. The Company is in the business of exploration for oil and gas in Africa. The Company’s business includes working interests in exploration acreage in the Republic of Kenya (“Kenya”), the Republic of Chad (“Chad”), the Joint Development Zone (“JDZ”) between the Democratic Republic of Săo Tomé and Príncipe (“STP”), the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN” or “Nigeria”), and the exclusive economic zone of Săo Tomé and Príncipe (the “Exclusive Economic Zone” or “EEZ”).
 
ERHC’s strategy in Kenya and Chad is to partner with other oil and gas operators to perform exploration work and further develop assets held through Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) with the governments of both countries.  ERHC plans to raise funds by farming out some working interest in these blocks in exchange for cash payments or other valuable consideration.
 
The Company’s strategy in the JDZ and EEZ is to farm out its working interests to well established oil and gas operators for valuable consideration including upfront cash payments and being carried for ERHC’s share of the exploration costs.  This has already been done successfully on Blocks 2, 3 and 4 of the JDZ where ERHC has benefited from partnerships with Addax Petroleum and Sinopec Corporation, which have operated some of the license areas on behalf of ERHC.
 
ERHC is now pursuing a similar approach for JDZ Blocks 5, 6 and 9 as well as for blocks in the EEZ.
 
Apart from its oil and gas exploration activities in Kenya, Chad, the JDZ and the EEZ, ERHC continues to pursue other oil and gas opportunities in Africa. These opportunities also include the possible acquisition of significant equity stakes in other oil and gas exploration and production companies and the resulting indirect interest in the underlying exploration and production assets of such other companies.
 
 ERHC is currently acquiring oil and gas properties in Texas. These US acquisitions are being carried on by and in the name of NewStar Oil& Gas Company, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ERHC (“NewStar”). NewStar is incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas. The focus of all acquisitions by Newstar will be producing or near-producing properties with significant upside potential.

REPUBLIC OF KENYA
 
ERHC Kenya Acreage
 
In June 2012, after months of negotiations between ERHC and the Government of Kenya, the Government awarded Block 11A for oil and gas exploration and development in Kenya to the Company. On June 28, 2012, the Company announced that it had signed a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) on Block 11A with the Government of Kenya.  A PSC is an agreement that governs the relationship between ERHC (and any future joint-venture partners) and the Government of Kenya in respect of exploration and production in the Block awarded to the Company.  The PSC details, among other things, the work commitments (including acquisition of data, drilling of wells, social projects, etc.), the time frame for completion of the work commitments, production sharing between the parties and the Government, and how the costs of exploration, development and production will be recovered.
 

By virtue of the PSC, the Company initially acquired a 90% interest in Block 11A, which encompasses 11,950.06 square kilometers or 2.95 million square acres.  The Government of Kenya has a 10% carried participating interest up to the declaration of commerciality and may thereafter acquire an additional 10% interest in the PSC in which case the total Government participation would rise to 20%.
 
Circle Oil Limited (www.circleoilandgas.com) (“Circle”) acted as finder in ERHC’s acquisition of the Block by facilitating ERHC’s entry into Kenya, including the introduction of Dr. Peter Thuo, ERHC’s Kenya-based geoscientist and technical adviser who provided liaison services in the pursuit of ERHC’s application. Circle’s involvement provided significant efficiencies, including substantial cost savings, in ERHC’s application process.  By virtue of the terms of the business finder’s agreement reached between Circle and ERHC, Circle is entitled to receive a 5% payment on the value of the acquisition accruing to ERHC from the application.  Circle has opted to receive this fee in the form of a carried 5% of ERHC’s total interest in Block 11A.
 
In October, 2013, ERHC entered into a farm-out agreement with CEPSA Kenya Limited, an affiliate of Compañía Española de Petróleos, S.A.U., an international oil and gas company ("CEPSA"). The farm-out agreement was approved by the Government of the Republic of Kenya during the quarter ended June 30, 2014. Under terms of the agreement, ERHC transferred majority of its interest in Kenya Block 11A as well as operatorship to CEPSA. The farm-out agreement includes a carry and other considerations.

Kenya Operations Update
 
   
· | As previously advised, the Tarach-1 well was always designed as an exploratory well. An exploratory well is drilled purely for information gathering (“exploration”) purposes in an area that is yet unproven with regard to petroleum resources. The site selection for an exploratory well is based on seismic data and other pre-drill geoscientific surveys.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Operator analysis of the results if the Tarach-1 well shows that it did not encounter any reservoirs. The operator has therefore classified Tarach-1 a dry well. The well has accordingly been plugged and abandoned
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



It is important to remind investors and other stakeholders, while the pre-drill geological and geophysical work might indicate prospectively and reasonable chances of success, there are no guarantees before drilling that there will be a discovery of hydrocarbons. If there is a discovery, there is no guarantee that it will be commercial or in such quantities as to justify a development project.


The Company continues to work with Deloitte Corporate Finance LLC (DCF) on a further farm-down of our interest in the Block to help raise funds for the company.

REPUBLIC OF CHAD
 
ERHC’s Chad Acreage
 
On July 6, 2011, the Company announced that it had signed a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) on the three oil blocks with the Government of Chad.  A PSC is an agreement that governs the relationship between ERHC (and any future joint-venture partners) and the Government of Chad in respect of exploration and production in the Blocks awarded to the Company.  The initial period of exploration commenced on July 12, 2012 with the publication, in Chadian Government’s Gazette Principal, of the Exclusive Exploration Authorization, granted to ERHC by the Government of Chad.
 
During the quarter ended June 30, 2014, the Company received the arrêté (decree) of the President of Chad giving presidential seal of approval to the Company’s request to obtain oil exploration Block BDS 2008 and its voluntary relinquishment of the Manga and Chari-Ouest III Blocks.

Chad Operations Update
 
 As of September 30, 2016, ERHC continues to talk with potential farm-in partners. The next stage of exploration is a seismic survey on ERHC’s two focus areas. ERHC is exploring, as one of its funding options, the possibility of a right-to-earn partnership in exchange for seismic services. Based on the result of an aero-magnetic and gravity survey that ERHC completed over the Block, total Petroleum Initially in Place (PIIP) for one of ERHC's two focus areas has been estimated at 278 million barrels (with a high case of 876 million barrels). ERHC holds a 100 percent interest in BDS 2008.
 
ERHC's exploration team is developing a Request for Proposals for a 2-D seismic acquisition program. The exploration team continues to work on securing regulatory approvals for the seismic program in ERHC's two focus areas. One is north of Esso's Tega and Maku discoveries in the Doseo basin and the other is east of and on trend with OPIC's Benoy-1 margin discovery in the Doba basin.
 
Focus Areas
 ERHC's exploration focus is on Block BDS 2008 which measures 41,800 square kilometers or 10,329,000 acres. Within this block, two focus areas have been identified:
 
- North of Esso’s Tega and Maku discoveries in the Doseo basin; and
 
- East of and on trend with OPIC’s Benoy-1 margin discovery in the Doba basin.

ERHC’s exploration team has commenced planning toward 2-D seismic acquisition. The information gathered through an airborne gravity/magnetic survey of the Block in Southern Chad proved to be a significant improvement on current data resolution. ERHC's sub-contractor, Bridgeporth Ltd., a specialist geosciences company, completed the survey during the fourth quarter of 2014, confirming the preliminary leads and revealing additional targets. The main conclusions of the study are as follows:
 
a) The Graben edge is clearly visible in the southwest corner of the Bridgeporth survey.
 
b) The data can be used to target seismic acquisition over possible rift associated structures.
 
c) It appears that the Graben edge will enter into the ERHC block northeast of the Bridgeporth survey.
 
d) Regional profile data acquired by Bridgeporth suggests that the gravity low to the north of BDS 2008 could indeed be a rifted section.
 
e) The saddle feature in the west central portion of the Block should be investigated.
 

As the Company did with the JDZ and Kenya Block 11A, ERHC continues to explore a farm-out to spread risk. The Chad acreage is also within the scope of Deloitte Corporation Finance LLC (DCF)'s engagement and ERHC continues to work with DCF to find suitable farm-out or joint venture partners.

NIGERIA – SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE JOINT DEVELOPMENT ZONE (“JDZ”)
 
Background of the JDZ
 
In the spring of 2001, Sao Tome & Principe and Nigeria signed a treaty establishing a JDZ for the joint development of petroleum and other resources in the overlapping area of their respective maritime boundaries.  The treaty also established an administrative body, the Joint Development Authority (“JDA”), to administer the treaty and all activities in the JDZ. Revenues derived from the JDZ will be shared 60:40 between the governments of Nigeria and Săo Tomé & Príncipe, respectively. The JDZ lies approximately 180 kilometers south of Nigeria, in the Gulf of Guinea, one of the most prolific hydrocarbon regions of the world.  .
 
ERHC’s Rights in the JDZ
 
In April 2003, the Company and STP entered into an Option Agreement (the “2003 Option Agreement”) in which the Company relinquished significant prior legal rights and financial interests in the Joint Development Zone (“JDZ”) in exchange for preferential exploration rights in the JDZ.  Following the exercise of ERHC’s rights as set forth in the 2003 Option Agreement, the JDA confirmed the award in 2004 of participating interests (“Original Participating Interest”) in each of JDZ Blocks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9 of the JDZ during the 2004/5 licensing round conducted by the JDA.  ERHC also jointly bid with internationally recognized technical partners for additional participating interests in the JDZ during the 2004/5 licensing round.  As a result of the joint bid, ERHC won additional participating interests (“Joint Bid Participating Interest”) in Blocks 2, 3 and 4.  The following is a tabulation of ERHC’s participating interests in the JDZ.

ERHC’s Participating Agreements in the JDZ
 
The following are the particulars of the Participating Agreements by which ERHC assigned some of its participating interests in JDZ Blocks 2, 3 and 4 to technical partners so that the technical partners would operate the Blocks and carry ERHC’s proportionate share of costs in the Blocks until production, if any, commenced from the Blocks:
 
 
Date of Participation Agreement | Party(ies) to the Participation Agreement | Participating Interest(s) Assigned | | | Participating Interest Assigned Price | 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+-------+---+---------------------------------------+--
JDZ Block 2 - Participation Agreement - ERHC Retained Interest of 22.00% | | | 
March 2, 2006 | Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration Production Co. Nigeria Ltd - a subsidiary of Sinopec International Petroleum and Production Corporation | | 28.67 | % | | $ | 13,600,000
 | Addax Energy Nigeria Limited - an Addax Petroleum Corporation subsidiary | | 14.33 | % | | $ | 6,800,000 
JDZ Block 3 - Participation Agreement - ERHC Retained Interest of 10.00% | | | | 
February 15, 2006 | Addax Petroleum Resources Nigeria Limited - a subsidiary of Addax Petroleum Corporation | | 15.00 | % | | $ | 7,500,000

Under the terms of the Participation Agreements Sinopec and Addax agreed to pay all of ERHC’s future costs for petroleum operations (“the carried costs”) in respect of ERHC's retained interests in the blocks.  Additionally, Sinopec and Addax are entitled to 100% of ERHC’s allocation of cost oil plus up to 50% of ERHC’s allocation of profit oil from the retained interests on individual blocks until Sinopec and Addax Sub recover 100% of ERHC’s carried costs.
 
On or about October 2, 2009, Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation acquired all of the outstanding shares of Addax Petroleum Corporation
 
ERHC’s JDZ Acreage
 
ERHC has working interests in six of the nine Blocks in the JDZ, as follows:
 
 
· | JDZ Block 2: 22.0% 
--+--------------------


· | JDZ Block 3: 10.0% 
--+--------------------


· | JDZ Block 4: 19.5% 
--+--------------------


· | JDZ Block 5: 15.0% (in arbitration) 
--+-------------------------------------


· | JDZ Block 6: 15.0% (in arbitration) 
--+-------------------------------------


· | JDZ Block 9: 20.0% 
--+--------------------



The working interest percentages represent ERHC’s share of all the hydrocarbon production from the blocks and obligates ERHC to pay a corresponding percentage of the costs of drilling, production and operating the blocks.  Through Exploration Phase 1 in blocks 2, 3 and 4, these costs have been carried by the operators.  The operators can only recover their costs by carrying ERHC until production whereupon the operators will recover their costs from production revenues.
 
In 2009, Sinopec and Addax, ERHC's technical partners and operators in Blocks 2, 3 and 4 undertook an exploratory drilling campaign across the three blocks that was completed in January 2010.
 
Biogenic gas was discovered in each block and discussions continue between the Joint Development Authority and the parties, including ERHC, that hold interests in JDZ Blocks 2, 3 and 4, regarding drilling results. The meetings with the JDA are aimed at reaching a definitive agreement on how to proceed with the next stage of exploration in the Blocks following the expiration of Exploration Phase I in March 2012.
 
JDZ Operations Update
 
 The JDZ partnership is currently assessing the data for possible new exploration play concepts in this area. As of September 30, 2016 The Nigeria - São Tomé and Príncipe Joint Development Authority (JDA) continues to engage with the remaining JDZ contracting parties, including ERHC, on the way forward for further exploration.

SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE (“EEZ”)
 
Overview of ERHC’s EEZ Blocks
 
The Săo Tomé and Príncipe EEZ is delineated over an expanse of waters offshore Săo Tomé and Príncipe that covers approximately 160,000 square kilometers.  In terms of hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation, the EEZ is a frontier region that sits south of the Niger Delta and west of the Gabon salt basin, retaining similarities with each of those prolific hydrocarbon regions.  The regional seismic database comprises approximately 12,000 kilometers of seismic data. Interpretation of that seismic data shows numerous structures in the EEZ that have similar characteristics to known hydrocarbon accumulations in the area.
 
ERHC’s Rights in the EEZ
 
Under a 2001 agreement with the Government of Săo Tomé and Príncipe (“STP”), ERHC was vested with the rights to participate in exploration and production activities in the EEZ.  These rights included (a) the right to receive up to 100% of two blocks of ERHC’s choice and (b) the option to acquire up to a 15% paid working interest in each of two additional blocks of ERHC’s choice in the EEZ.  In 2010, ERHC exercised its rights to receive up to 100% of two blocks of ERHC’s choice in the EEZ and was duly awarded Blocks 4 and 11 of the EEZ by the Government of STP.
 
EEZ Block 4 is 5,808 square kilometers, situated directly east of the island of Príncipe.  The northeastern area near EEZ Block 4 contains a large graben structure, which is bound by the Kribi Fracture Zone.
 
EEZ Block 11 totals 8,941 square kilometers, situated directly east of the island of Săo Tomé and abuts the territorial waters of Gabon. The southern area of the EEZ, where EEZ Block 11 is situated, contains parts of the Ascension and Fang Fracture Zones.
 
ERHC will decide whether to take up the option to acquire up to a 15% paid working interest in each of two additional blocks of the EEZ when called upon to exercise the option by the Government of STP in accordance with the agreements which provide for the rights and option.
 
PSC for the EEZ Block 11
 
In July 2014, ERHC and the National Petroleum Agency of Săo Tomé and Príncipe (ANP-STP) announced the conclusion of final terms for the Production Sharing Contract for EEZ Block 11.
 
A PSC is an agreement that governs the relationship between the Company (and its joint venture partners) and the Government of Săo Tomé and Príncipe in respect of exploration and production in any Block awarded to the Company.  The PSC spells out, among other things, the work commitments (including acquisition of data, drilling of wells, social projects, etc.), the time frames for accomplishing the work commitments, how production will be shared between the parties and the government, and how the costs of exploration, development and production will be recovered.
 
In October 2015, the Company reached an agreement with Kosmos Energy (NYSE: KOS), a leading independent oil and gas exploration and production company focused on frontier and emerging areas to transfer all ERHC's rights to Block 11 of the São Tomé and Principe Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to Kosmos. The agreement has been approved by the National Petroleum Agency of Sao Tome & Principe ("ANP-STP") as required in the requisite Production Sharing Contract ("PSC") for EEZ Block 11.
 
EEZ Operations Update
 
 ERHC has concluded negotiation of the terms of a Production Sharing Contract with the National Petroleum Agency of São Tomé and Principe (ANP-STP) for Block 4. The Company is currently in discussions with potential farm in partners. ERHC holds a 100 percent interest in EEZ Block 4, and 15% right to paid working interest in each of two additional blocks of the EEZ.

INVESTMENT IN OANDO ENERGY RESOURCES (FORMERLY EXILE RESOURCES)
 
During the year ended September 30, 2011, ERHC invested $1,350,000 in Exile Resources Inc, a company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (Ventures Exchange) stock in open market purchases.  ERHC’s intention was to gain an indirect interest in Exile’s underlying oil and gas exploration and production assets as well as the ability to participate in Exile’s decision making in respect of those assets.  ERHC was particularly interested in Exile’s carried interest in the proven Akepo field in the Niger Delta.
 
In July 2011, Oando Petroleum and Exploration Company (“Oando Petroleum”) commenced a reverse takeover (“RTO”) of Exile Resources.  In July 2012, Exile announced the completion of the RTO by Oando Petroleum and the change of name of the resultant company to Oando Energy Resources Inc, (“Oando Energy”). It also announced the listing of the company’s shares under the symbol “OER” on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and commencement of trading in the shares on the TSX from July 30, 2012.
 
During the year ended September 30, 2016, ERHC’s investment in the common stock of Oando Energy Resources, Inc. (“OER”), a Canadian oil and gas company that trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) was purchased by the majority shareholder of OER, pursuant to a shareholder approved buyout.
 
CURRENT PLANS FOR OPERATIONS
 
ERHC’s principal assets are its interests in rights for exploration for hydrocarbons in Kenya, Chad, the JDZ and the EEZ. ERHC has no current sources of income from its operations. The Company plans to develop its business by the acquisition of other assets which may include revenue-producing assets in diverse geographical areas and the forging of strategic, new business partnerships and alliances.  ERHC cannot currently predict the outcome of negotiations for acquisitions, or, if successful, their impact on the Company's operations.
PLANS FOR FUNDING EXISTING ASSETS AND POTENTIAL NEW ACQUISITIONS
 
ERHC's future plans will depend on the Company's ability to attract new funding. The Company is implementing a series of steps to fund the geophysical work, including magnetic/gravity and seismic surveys, prior to securing potential farm-out on Chad acreage. Said funding steps include but are not limited to the issuance of a series of convertible notes, which the Company has commenced, issuance of shares of common stock through registered direct offerings, which the Company plans to commence shortly and farm-outs to potential partners on its assets in Africa. The fund raising might include:

· | Farm-outs of part of the Company’s assets in Kenya, Chad and the Săo Tomé and Príncipe Exclusive Economic Zone
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Issue shares of common stock through a registered direct offering
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other available financing options
--+----------------------------------



The Company is continuing discussions with several international investment advisory and financial brokerage firms to act as financial advisors and intermediaries to ERHC. While ERHC has always used expert professional assistance to formulate and execute its capital raising initiatives, it is re-focusing on the retention of such advisors and intermediaries as a strategic imperative of the increased funding requirements that arise from the rollout of the new work programs in Chad and Kenya.  The new firms retained will perform such financial advisory and investment banking services for the Company as are customary and appropriate in transactions of this type, including assisting the Company in analyzing, structuring, negotiating and effecting proposed capital raises.  These initiatives may include any transaction or series of transactions in which one or more capital providers (existing or otherwise) commits debt capital to the Company, purchases equity of the Company (or securities of the Company convertible into equity), or alternatively funds the Company either directly or through farm-ins, farm-outs or other arrangements in which the capital provider earns an interest in oil and gas properties of the Company.
