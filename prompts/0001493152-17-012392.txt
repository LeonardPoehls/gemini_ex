Item 1. | Description of Business. 
--------+-------------------------------------------

 
WSI Industries, Inc. (the “Company”) makes its periodic and current reports available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports can be obtained by contacting the Company through its website at www.wsiindustries.com.
 
Overview
 
The Company was incorporated in Minnesota in 1950 for the purpose of performing precision contract machining for the aerospace, communication, and industrial markets. The major portions of Company revenues are derived from machining work for the aerospace/avionics/defense industries, recreational powersports vehicles (ATV and motorcycle) markets, energy industry, automotive industry and bioscience industry.
 
Contract manufacturing constitutes the Company’s entire business.
 
Products and Services
 
The Company manufactures metal components in medium to high volumes requiring tolerances as close as one ten-thousandth (.0001) of an inch. These components are manufactured in accordance with customer specifications using materials both purchased by the Company as well as being supplied by our customer.
Sales and Marketing
 
Our mission is to achieve diversified growth through the expansion of our contract machining and complimentary value-add services, as well as growth through partnerships and acquisitions. We have a team of direct sales force personnel that are dedicated to pursuing opportunities to organically grow our business. We also utilize independent sales reps to search out new business where appropriate. Our overall goal is to add core customers that will diversify the industries that we serve and will eventually become “pillar” accounts that support the overall organization. Our target markets include aerospace, avionics, defense, automotive, recreational powersports, heavy equipment and other industries that outsource machining services and have the need to build long-term relationships with a dependable supplier. We search out these types of customers via a wide variety of methods including prospecting, trade shows and networking with the goal of receiving request for quotes that we can provide proposals on and eventually win new business.
 
The Company has a reputation as a dependable supplier capable of meeting stringent specifications to produce quality components at high production rates. The Company has demonstrated an ability to develop sophisticated manufacturing processes and controls essential to produce precision and reliability in its products.
 
Customers
 
Sales were made to Polaris Industries, Inc. and related entities in the amount of $26,432,000, or 86% of total Company revenues, in fiscal 2017.

Competition
 
Although there are a large number of companies engaged in machining, the Company believes the number of entities with the technical capability and capacity for producing products of the class and in the volumes manufactured by the Company is relatively small. Competition is primarily based on product quality, service, timely delivery, and price. The Company also faces competition from customers with their own in-house machining capabilities. These customers weigh outsourcing on the basis of their own machining capacity and capabilities, cost and price, timely delivery and service.
Research and Development; Intellectual Property
 
We perform research and development for customers on an as requested and program basis for development of conceptual engineering and design activities prior to manufacturing the products. Our research and development activities are machining process oriented and not done towards the development of products. We did not expend significant dollars in 2017 or 2016 on company-sponsored product research and development. Patents and trademarks are not deemed significant to the Company.
Employees
 
At August 27, 2017, the Company had 91 full-time employees, none of whom were subject to a union contract. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales
 
The Company has no operations or any significant sales in any foreign country.
