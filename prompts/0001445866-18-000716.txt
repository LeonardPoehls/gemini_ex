The Company drew down consideration of $100,000 on the facility. The Consideration on the Note has a Maturity date of two years from payment of each Consideration. A one- time interest charge of 12% is applied to the principal sum on the on the date of the Consideration.

 On August 26, 2015, the Company filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection in Delaware in order to secure the existing assets from creditor actions. Case No. 15-11761 (MFW). Jakes Jordaan, Santa Fe’s former CEO, filed in the Affidavit in Support of the first day motion (full affidavit can be researched in the Delaware court filings. Case# 15-11761 MFW on August 26, 2015) that we have only one remaining option (plan) to have an orderly sale of all assets to satisfying qualified debt without any plan for the thereafter and he began working with Canaccord Genuity Inc. (“Canaccord”) as our investment banker to assist with these efforts. The “asset sale” took place in February 2016 and left Santa Fe Gold and Subsidiaries without any assets and with the remaining debt.
 After the dismissal of the bankruptcy case, the Company has limited assets, but is liable for all commitments and debts that remained outstanding. After the dismissal, the Company will divest itself from all subsidiaries and will keep only Santa Fe Gold, the parent company active. Santa Fe Gold Barbados, The Lordsburg Mining Company and AZCO will be dormant and all the commitments and debts will stay with the respective companies. The court set up a Trust fund that will be funded by the activities of the Summit mine for five years and the trust funds will be distributed by an independent trustee to all credit holders of record. 
 Santa Fe Gold failed to provide a plan of Reorganization with the filing of protection under the Bankruptcy Codes; the significant transactions that occurred upon emergence from bankruptcy were as follows:
 ·
The approximately $ 20 million of indebtedness outstanding on account of the Company’s senior notes and unsecured claims were reinstated. 
 
·
The courts established a GUC Trust Agreement in April 2016 with Gavin/Solmones as Trustee for the benefit of all creditors less Waterton Global. A profit interest is attached to the Summit mine (formerly owned by Santa Fe Gold and its subsidiaries) with the sole benefit for the Creditors holding unsecured claims filed by each creditor with the courts. 
 
Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11 Proceedings
 The Company and our Chapter 11 Subsidiaries received bankruptcy court confirmation of the dismissal on June 15, 2016, and subsequently emerged from bankruptcy. The only funds available for the future administrative costs were prepaid insurance funds from which we received a refund on June 08, 2016 of $44,926 and on August 22, 2016 received $4,135. The Company upon emergence resorted to selling equity for cash so as to proceed on reviving the Company. Currently we have no continuing commitment from any party to provide necessary additional working capital, or if one becomes available, there is no certainty that its terms will be favorable or acceptable to the Company to continue its current business plan. 
Fiscal 2017 Financing Activity
 On July 19, 2016, a new company was formed: Santa Fe Acquisition LLC (“SFA”) with Tom Laws, our CEO, as the signer, for the sole purpose of acquiring assets for Santa Fe Gold (“SFG”). On September 25, 2017, with an effective date of July 23, 2016, the CEO assigned ownership of SFA to Santa Fe Gold whereby SFG became to sole member of SFA resulting in SFA becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of SFG. All major purchases were made through the SFA Company for the benefit of SFG, with the funding provided by SFG. 
 During the fiscal ending June 30, 2017, the Company proceeded to implement our initial plan to emerge from the bankruptcy proceedings. The Company raised $2,708,168 from the sale of unregistered common stock and the exercise of attached warrants. The funds were used as working capital to implement the Company business plan. As part of the plan, the Company negotiated the payoff of seven convertible notes and accrued interest with an aggregate balance of $4,358,282 for $274,782 in cash payments and recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of $4,083,500. The Company also negotiated settlements with various vendor creditors with an aggregated balance of $343,902 for cash settlement payments of $10,734 and recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of $333,168.

Between September 14, 2016 and December 31, 2016, we secured claims 44 claims and paid $8,328 for BLM filing fees, these claims have a 5% royalty attached. We will continue to seek additional claims with other existing mines for which we may have to pay royalties or establish a partnership if an agreement is reached.
 On December 9, 2016, the Company retained International Monetary ("IM") as its Investment Banking & Strategic Advisory firm to provide capital resources, structure financing, proprietary investor relations services, advice on maximizing growth and valuation, M&A advisory and counsel to the Company's management on other strategic decisions.

In addition, IM is entitled to additional common shares amounting to 2% of the Company’s common stock on a fully diluted basis six month from the date of the agreement.
 On April 10, 2017, the Company delivered $500,000 to an attorneys to be held in escrow pending the Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) dated August 18, 2017, and subsequently applied as part of the purchase price due under an Agreement with Bullard’s Peak Corporation and Black Hawk Consolidated Mines Company to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock for a cash purchase price in the aggregate amount of $3,000,000, to be paid with installments stated in the Bullard’s Peak Agreement. The escrow payment under the Agreement was transferred to the seller on June 12, 2018.
 Competitive Business Conditions 
 Many companies are engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development and mining of mineral properties. We are at a disadvantage with respect to those competitors whose technical staff and financial resources exceed our own. Although the Company survived the bankruptcy with no assets or cash, we decided to start increasing stock value by using equity funding to acquire claims and restart our business. 
 Reclamation
We generally will be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and revegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts would be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. As soon as we have a mining operation, we will be required to arrange and pledge certificates of deposits for reclamation with the state regulatory agencies. At this time no reclamation cost are calculated or carried forward. 
 Government Regulation
Our mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in the United States, and the State of New Mexico, which govern mining, milling, prospecting, development, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, and waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. There are no current orders or directions relating to us with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations. 
 Environmental Regulation
All future projects are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. Our policy is to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that our operations will be conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
 Changes to current local, state or federal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we will operate could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects. 
 Employees
 As of June 30, 2017, we had two employees. In addition, we use consultants with specific skills to assist with various aspects of our project evaluation, business plan, due diligence, corporate governance and regulatory filings. 
Office Facilities 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 3544 Rio Grande Blvd. NW, Albuquerque, NM 87107. Our telephone number is (505) 255-4852.
