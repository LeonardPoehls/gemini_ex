ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Our strategy is to commercialize Rhopressa®, approved by the FDA on December 18, 2017, in North American markets and advance our product candidate, RoclatanTM, to regulatory approval. We are in the process of hiring a commercial team that will include approximately 100 sales representatives to target approximately 12,000 high prescribing eye-care professionals throughout the United States. This sales force will initially be responsible for sales of Rhopressa®, and will also be responsible for sales of RoclatanTM, if approved. Our strategy also includes developing our business outside of North America, including obtaining regulatory approval in Europe and Japan on our own for Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM. If we obtain regulatory approval, we currently expect to commercialize Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM in Europe on our own, and likely partner for commercialization in Japan.
Since our initial public offering (“IPO”) in October 2013 through which we raised approximately $68.3 million of net proceeds, we have raised additional net proceeds through December 31, 2017 of approximately $122.9 million through the sale and issuance of the 2014 Convertible Notes (as defined herein) in September 2014, and approximately $351.3 million through the issuance and sale of common stock under our shelf registration statements on Form S-3 and prior “at-the-market” sales agreements. 
Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we issued and sold approximately 2.3 million additional shares of our common stock, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $136.2 million, after deducting fees and expenses, upon the completion of the “at-the-market” offering that commenced in December 2017 and pursuant to an underwriting agreement, dated January 23, 2018, related to a registered public offering. 
Our FDA-approved product, Rhopressa®, is a once-daily eye drop designed to reduce elevated intraocular pressure (“IOP”) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The active ingredient in Rhopressa®, netarsudil, is a Rho kinase inhibitor. We believe that Rhopressa® represents the first of a new drug class for reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years. Based on clinical data, we expect that Rhopressa® will have the potential to compete with non-PGA (prostaglandin analog) products as a preferred adjunctive therapy to prostaglandin analogs (“PGAs”), due to its targeting of the diseased tissue known as the trabecular meshwork (“TM”), its demonstrated ability to reduce IOP at consistent levels across tested baselines, and its preferred once-daily dosing relative to currently marketed non-PGA products. Adjunctive therapies currently represent nearly one-half of the glaucoma prescription market in the United States, according to IQVIA (formerly known as IMS Health). We believe that Rhopressa® may also become a preferred therapy where PGAs are contraindicated, for patients who do not respond to PGAs and for patients who choose to avoid the cosmetic issues associated with PGA products.
Our advanced-stage product candidate, RoclatanTM, is a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa® and latanoprost, the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma. We plan to submit a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for RoclatanTM to the FDA in the second quarter of 2018. We believe, based on our clinical data, that RoclatanTM has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any currently marketed glaucoma medication. Therefore, we believe that RoclatanTM, if approved, could compete with both PGA and non-PGA therapies and become the product of choice for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite use of the currently available therapies.
We own the worldwide rights to all indications for Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM. We have patent protection for Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM in the United States through at least 2030 and internationally through dates ranging from 2030 to 2037. Our intellectual property portfolio contains patents and pending patent applications related to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use, and synthetic methods.
We also seek to enhance our longer-term commercial potential by identifying and advancing additional product candidates. This may be accomplished through our internal discovery efforts, our entry into potential research collaborations or in-licensing arrangements or our acquisition of additional ophthalmic products or technologies or product candidates that complement our current product portfolio. Our collaboration with DSM, a global science-based company headquartered in the Netherlands, provides access to their bio-erodible polymer technology, and our acquisition of assets from Envisia Therapeutics Inc. (“Envisia”), which includes the right to use PRINT® manufacturing technology for ophthalmology, are designed to 
1

advance our progress in developing potential future product candidates to treat retinal diseases. Aided by these technologies, we are developing two preclinical molecules focused on retinal disease. AR-13503, for which we expect to submit an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) in 2019, is an Aerie-owned Rho kinase and Protein kinase C inhibitor with potential in the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (“AMD”), diabetic retinopathy and related diseases of the retina, such as diabetic macular edema (“DME”). As the active metabolite of AR-13154(S), AR-13503 has shown lesion size decreases in an in vivo preclinical model of wet AMD at levels similar to the current market-leading wet AMD anti-VEGF product. Also preclinically, when used in combination with the market leading anti-VEGF product, AR-13503 produced greater lesion size reduction than the anti-VEGF product alone in a model of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, through the Envisia asset acquisition, we are also developing AR-1105, a preclinical dexamethasone steroid implant with potential in the treatment of DME, and currently expect to submit an IND in late 2018.
Further, we are evaluating our owned library of Rho kinase inhibitors for potential indications beyond ophthalmology. There are several disease categories where Rho kinase inhibitors have demonstrated benefits both preclinically and clinically in past third-party studies and trials, and we are initially focused on exploring potential opportunities for our molecules in pulmonary health, dermatology and cancer.
Glaucoma Overview
Glaucoma is one of the largest segments in the global ophthalmic market. In 2016, branded and generic glaucoma product sales exceeded $5.0 billion in the United States, Europe and Japan in aggregate, according to IQVIA. Prescription volume for glaucoma products in the United States alone was 36 million in 2016 and is expected to grow, driven in large part by the aging population. 
The PGA and non-PGA market segments each represent approximately one-half of the prescription volume in the United States glaucoma market, as shown in the following chart, which is based on IQVIA data.
According to the National Eye Institute, it is estimated that over 2.7 million people in the United States suffer from glaucoma, a number that is expected to reach approximately 4.3 million by 2030. Furthermore, The Eye Diseases Prevalence Research Group has estimated that only half of the nation’s glaucoma sufferers know that they have the disease. Glaucoma is a progressive and highly individualized disease, in which elevated levels of IOP are associated with damage to the optic nerve, resulting in irreversible vision loss and potentially blindness. Patients may suffer the adverse effects of glaucoma across a wide range of IOP levels. There are multiple factors that can contribute to an individual developing glaucoma, including, but not limited to, age, family history and ethnicity. Glaucoma is treated by the reduction of IOP, which has been shown to slow the progression of vision loss. In a healthy eye, fluid is continuously produced and drained in order to maintain pressure equilibrium and provide nutrients to the eye tissue. The FDA recognizes sustained reduction of IOP as the primary clinical endpoint for the approval of drugs to treat patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension. The primary drainage mechanism of the eye is the TM, which accounts for approximately 80% of fluid drainage in a healthy eye, while the secondary drainage 
2

mechanism, the uveoscleral pathway, is responsible for the remaining drainage. In glaucoma patients, damage to the TM results in insufficient drainage of fluid from the eye, which causes increased IOP and damage to the optic nerve. 
Once glaucoma develops, it is a chronic condition that requires life-long treatment. The initial treatment for glaucoma patients is typically the use of prescription eye drops. PGAs have become the most widely prescribed glaucoma drug class. The most frequently prescribed PGA is once-daily latanoprost. The most commonly prescribed non-PGA drugs belong to the beta blocker class. The most frequently prescribed beta blocker is twice-daily timolol. Other non-PGA drug classes include the alpha agonists and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. When PGA monotherapy is insufficient to control IOP or contraindicated due to concerns about side effects, non-PGA products are used either as add-on therapy to the PGA or as an alternative monotherapy. It is estimated that up to 50% of glaucoma patients receiving PGA monotherapy require add-on therapy within two years of initial prescription of the drug to maintain adequate control of IOP. 
We believe there are significant unmet needs in the glaucoma market as is evident by the degree of use of multiple therapies to treat patients with the disease, and understand that eye-care professionals are eager for new therapy choices. PGAs have side effects, contraindications and reduced efficacy in patients with low to moderately elevated IOPs relative to patients with higher IOPs. Non-PGAs are less efficacious than PGAs, have more serious and a greater number of side effects and contraindications, and require multiple daily doses. As a result, we believe there is a significant unmet need in both the PGA and non-PGA market segments, each of which represents approximately one-half of the U.S. and European glaucoma market based on prescription volumes, according to IQVIA. Despite the limitations of existing glaucoma drugs, Xalatan® (latanoprost), the best-selling PGA, together with Xalacom®, its fixed-dose combination with a beta blocker, which is not available in the United States, generated peak annual global revenues of approximately $1.7 billion prior to the introduction of their generic equivalents, and the most commonly prescribed non-PGA drugs each generated peak annual global revenues of over $400 million prior to the introduction of their generic equivalents. Rhopressa® is the first of a new class of glaucoma drug products, and may be prescribed by eye-care professionals as a preferred adjunctive therapy for patients taking PGAs, due to its IOP-reducing ability, more convenient dosing and better tolerability profile compared to currently marketed non-PGA adjunctive products.
Our Product, Product Candidate and Pipeline
Rhopressa®, our product approved by the FDA, has demonstrated that it reduces IOP through ROCK inhibition, its mechanism of action (“MOA”), by which Rhopressa® increases the outflow of aqueous humor through the TM, which accounts for approximately 80% of fluid drainage from the eye. Our late-stage pipeline consists of RoclatanTM, a single-drop fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa® and latanoprost, which reduces IOP through the same MOA as Rhopressa® and, through a second MOA, utilizing the ability of latanoprost to increase the outflow of aqueous humor through the uveoscleral pathway, the eye’s secondary drain. Our preclinical pipeline includes AR-1105, a dexamethasone steroid implant being developed for DME and AR-13503, a Rho kinase and Protein kinase C inhibitor being developed for diabetic retinopathy, wet AMD and related diseases of the retina, such as DME.
We discovered and developed Rhopressa®, RoclatanTM and AR-13503 (an earlier generation of which was known as AR-13154) internally through a rational drug design approach that coupled medicinal chemistry with high content screening of compounds in proprietary cell-based assays. We selected and formulated Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM for preclinical in vivo testing following a detailed characterization of over 3,000 synthesized ROCK inhibitors. We continue to seek to discover and develop new compounds in our research laboratories and employ a scientific staff with expertise in medicinal chemistry, analytical chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology, pharmacology and pharmaceutical science. We are in the process of screening our owned Rho kinase molecule library for indications beyond ophthalmology.

Rhopressa®
Rhopressa® is the first of a new class of glaucoma drug products that was discovered by our scientists. It was approved by the FDA on December 18, 2017 for the reduction of elevated IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, and is not yet approved outside of the United States. Our key target markets outside the United States include Europe and Japan.
The active ingredient in Rhopressa® is netarsudil, a Rho kinase inhibitor (“ROCK inhibitor”). ROCK is a protein kinase, which is an enzyme that modifies other proteins by chemically adding phosphate groups to them. Specifically, ROCK regulates actin and myosin, which are proteins that are responsible for cellular contraction. ROCK activity also promotes the production of extracellular matrix proteins. ROCK inhibitors block TM cell contraction and reduce the production of extracellular matrix, thereby improving fluid outflow and consequently reducing IOP. 
Rhopressa® is expected to compete primarily in the adjunctive therapy market, which represents approximately one-half of the U.S. glaucoma prescription market and totaled approximately 36 million prescriptions in 2016 according to IQVIA. Currently marketed therapies that are used adjunctively to PGAs are older generation products that are generally dosed between two and three times a day, have MOA(s) focused on reducing fluid production, often have lower efficacy levels and have systemic side effects. Based on our clinical trials, we believe Rhopressa® has the potential to be the drug of choice as an adjunctive therapy to PGAs due to its once-daily dosing and efficacy and safety profile. 
Rhopressa® in the United States
We resubmitted our NDA for Rhopressa® to the FDA on February 28, 2017, and received approval from the FDA on December 18, 2017, two months earlier than the scheduled Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) date of February 28, 2018. FDA approval was based on efficacy data from three Phase 3 registration trials for Rhopressa®, Rocket 1, Rocket 2 and Rocket 4, in which once-daily Rhopressa® was demonstrated to be non-inferior to twice-daily timolol. In addition, the 12-month safety data from the Rocket 2 trial confirmed a favorable safety profile for the drug and demonstrated a consistent IOP-reducing effect throughout the 12-month period at the specified measurement time points. We also included as supportive data the 90-day efficacy results of our Mercury 1 trial, further discussed below, with the NDA submission for Rhopressa®.
Rhopressa® Outside of the United States
Our Rocket 4 trial for Rhopressa® was designed to generate adequate six-month safety data for European regulatory approval, along with the efficacy and safety data from our other Phase 3 registration trials for Rhopressa®, Rocket 1 and Rocket 2. We expect to submit an MAA for Rhopressa® with the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) in the second half of 2018. The six-month safety and efficacy data were largely consistent with observations in the other Rhopressa® Phase 3 registration trials and 
4

the 90-day efficacy results achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating non-inferiority of Rhopressa® compared to timolol.
We also initiated Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2017, which are designed to meet the requirements of Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) for potential regulatory submission of Rhopressa® in Japan. These clinical trials enrolled Japanese and Japanese-American subjects to support subsequent Phase 3 registration trials that are expected to be conducted in Japan. 
Rhopressa® Additional Research
In a 24-hour, 12-patient pilot study comparing the efficacy of Rhopressa® to that of placebo, Rhopressa® demonstrated similar levels of IOP reduction during nocturnal and diurnal periods. This is potentially a further differentiating feature of Rhopressa® when considering that currently marketed products have demonstrated little or no efficacy at night, and eye pressure is typically highest when patients are asleep. 
In addition, we continue to explore the longer-term impact of Rhopressa® on the diseased TM. We have issued several research updates on preclinical results demonstrating that Rhopressa® may have the potential for disease modification, including stopping and reversing fibrosis in the TM, and increasing perfusion in the trabecular outflow pathway thus increasing the delivery of nutrients to the diseased tissue. We are also evaluating the potential neuroprotective benefits of Rhopressa®. 
RoclatanTM
Our advanced-stage product candidate is once-daily RoclatanTM, a fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa® and latanoprost. We believe, based on our Phase 3 clinical trial data, that RoclatanTM, if approved, may provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any currently marketed glaucoma medication. Therefore, we believe that RoclatanTM, if approved, could compete with both PGA and non-PGA therapies for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite use of currently available therapies.
RoclatanTM in the United States 
We have completed two Phase 3 registration trials for RoclatanTM. The first Phase 3 registration trial for RoclatanTM, named “Mercury 1,” was a 12-month safety trial with a 90-day efficacy readout. Mercury 1 achieved its primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating statistical superiority of RoclatanTM to each of its components, including Rhopressa® and the market-leading PGA, latanoprost, and the safety and tolerability results showed no drug-related serious adverse events. On July 19, 2017, we announced the Mercury 1 12-month safety results, noting the safety results for RoclatanTM showed no treatment-related serious adverse events and minimal evidence of treatment-related systemic effects. There were no new adverse events that developed over the 12-month period relative to the 90-day results, and there were no drug-related serious or systemic adverse events.
The second Phase 3 registration trial for RoclatanTM, named “Mercury 2,” was a 90-day efficacy and safety trial also designed to demonstrate statistical superiority of RoclatanTM to each of its components. The Mercury 2 trial design was identical to that of Mercury 1, except that Mercury 2 was a 90-day trial without the additional nine-month safety extension included in Mercury 1. Both Mercury 1 and Mercury 2 achieved their 90-day primary efficacy endpoints of demonstrating statistical superiority of RoclatanTM over each of its components at all measured time points. We expect to submit an NDA for RoclatanTM to the FDA in the second quarter of 2018.
RoclatanTM Outside of the United States
Mercury 1 and Mercury 2 will also be used for European approval of RoclatanTM, and we initiated a third Phase 3 registration trial for RoclatanTM, named “Mercury 3,” in Europe during the third quarter of 2017. Mercury 3, a six-month safety trial, is designed to compare RoclatanTM to Ganfort®, a fixed-dose combination product of bimatoprost, a PGA, and timolol, marketed in Europe. If successful, Mercury 3 is expected to improve our commercialization prospects in Europe. Patients will be evaluated with maximum baseline IOPs ranging from above 20 mmHg to below 36 mmHg. The trial will be conducted primarily in the larger European countries, and we currently expect to read out topline 90-day efficacy data for the trial in the first half of 2019 and to submit an MAA to the EMA for RoclatanTM by the end of 2019.
RoclatanTM Phase 3 Trial Data to Date
We have completed two Phase 3 registration trials for RoclatanTM, as discussed above. Mercury 1 was a 12-month safety trial with a 90-day efficacy readout. Mercury 1 achieved its primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating statistical superiority of RoclatanTM to each of its components, including Rhopressa® and latanoprost, in patients with maximum baseline IOPs of above 
5

20 mmHg to below 36 mmHg. In the 90-day efficacy results, the IOP-reducing effect of RoclatanTM exceeded that of monotherapy with latanoprost in a range of 1.3 mmHg to 2.5 mmHg and Rhopressa® in a range of 1.8 mmHg to 3.0 mmHg. On July 19, 2017, we announced the 12-month safety results of the Mercury 1 study, which were consistent with those observed for the 90-day efficacy period, noting the safety results for RoclatanTM showed no treatment-related serious adverse events and minimal evidence of treatment-related systemic effects. The most common RoclatanTM adverse event was conjunctival hyperemia, which was observed in approximately 60% of patients, of which approximately 70% was determined to be mild. Other ocular adverse events reported in approximately 5% to 18% of patients in the RoclatanTM group included cornea verticillata, conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pruritus, increased lacrimation, reduced visual acuity, blepharitis and punctate keratitis. 
The graph below represents the responder analysis from the Mercury 1 90-day efficacy results, which shows the percentage of patients for whom IOP was reduced to 18 mmHg or lower, comparing RoclatanTM to Rhopressa® and latanoprost.


Similar to Mercury 1, Mercury 2 achieved its 90-day primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating statistical superiority over each of its components at all measured time points. The study evaluated patients with maximum baseline IOPs ranging from above 20 to below 36 mmHg at nine measured time points over the trial. The IOP-reducing effect of RoclatanTM exceeded that of monotherapy with latanoprost in a range of 1.5 to 2.4 mmHg and Rhopressa® in a range of 2.2 to 3.3 mmHg, with efficacy levels remaining consistent for all arms of the study throughout the trial. Similarly to Mercury 1, RoclatanTM reduced mean diurnal IOPs to 16 mmHg or lower in 56% of patients, a significantly higher percentage than observed in the comparator arms of the study. The most common RoclatanTM adverse event observed in the study was conjunctival hyperemia, which was reported in nearly 55% of patients, and was scored as mild for approximately 70% of affected patients. Other ocular adverse events reported in approximately 5% to 13% of patients in the RoclatanTM group included cornea verticillata, conjunctival hemorrhage and corneal disorder (asymptomatic change in appearance of corneal endothelial cells). In addition, levels of IOP reduction in Mercury 2 were consistent with those observed in the Mercury 1 90-day efficacy results for all arms of the study. 
Pipeline Opportunities
We are evaluating possible uses of our existing proprietary portfolio of Rho kinase inhibitors beyond glaucoma and ophthalmology. Our owned preclinical small molecule, AR-13503 (an earlier generation of which was known as AR-13154), has demonstrated the potential for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy and wet AMD by inhibiting Rho kinase and Protein kinase C. As the active metabolite of AR-13154(S), AR-13503 has shown lesion size decreases in an in vivo preclinical model of wet AMD at levels similar to the current market-leading wet AMD anti-VEGF product. Also preclinically, when used in combination with the market leading anti-VEGF product, AR-13503 produced greater lesion size reduction than the anti-VEGF product alone in a model of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This molecule has not yet been tested in humans in a clinical trial setting. Pending additional studies, AR-13503 may have the potential to provide an entirely new mechanism and pathway to treat diabetic retinopathy, wet AMD and related diseases of the retina, such as DME. We expect to submit an IND for AR-13503 in 2019. Since AR-13503 is a small molecule with a short half-life, and the aforementioned diseases are located in the back of the eye, a delivery mechanism is needed to deliver the molecule to the back of the eye for a sustained delivery period. 
6

To that end, on July 31, 2017, we announced that we entered into a collaborative research, development and licensing agreement with DSM. The research collaboration agreement includes an option to license DSM’s bio-erodible polymer implant technology for sustained delivery of certain Aerie compounds to treat ophthalmic diseases. This technology uses polyesteramide polymers to produce an injectable, thin fiber that is minute in size. Preclinical experiments have demonstrated early success in conjunction with AR-13503, including demonstration of linear, sustained elution rates over several months and achievement of target retinal drug concentrations.
Further, on October 4, 2017, we acquired the rights to use PRINT® technology in ophthalmology and certain other assets from Envisia. The PRINT® technology is a proprietary system capable of creating precisely-engineered sustained release products utilizing fully-scalable manufacturing processes. In addition, we acquired Envisia’s intellectual property rights relating to Envisia’s preclinical dexamethasone steroid implant for the potential treatment of DME that utilizes the PRINT® technology, which we refer to as AR-1105. We expect to submit an IND for AR-1105 in late 2018. We will also focus on using PRINT® to manufacture injectable implants containing AR-13503, potentially in conjunction with the bio-erodible polymer from DSM.
We may continue to enter into research collaboration arrangements, license, acquire or develop additional product candidates and technologies to broaden our presence in ophthalmology, and we continually explore and discuss potential additional opportunities for new ophthalmic products, delivery alternatives and new therapeutic areas with potential partners. We are currently focused on the evaluation of technologies for the delivery of our owned molecules to the back of the eye over sustained periods. Further, we are also currently screening our owned library of Rho kinase inhibitors for indications beyond ophthalmology, considering third-party studies and trials have demonstrated potential for Rho kinase inhibition in treating certain disease categories. We are initially focused on exploring potential opportunities for our molecules in pulmonary health, dermatology and cancers.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to become a leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative pharmaceutical products for the treatment of patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension and other diseases of the eye. We believe Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM have the potential to address many of the unmet medical needs in the glaucoma market. Key elements of our strategy are to:
Successfully launch and commercialize Rhopressa® in North America. We own worldwide rights to all indications for Rhopressa® and we plan to retain commercialization rights in North American markets. We expect to launch Rhopressa® in the United States by mid-second quarter of 2018. In December 2016, we hired a Chief Commercial Officer and have since hired several members of the commercialization leadership team. In connection with obtaining FDA approval of Rhopressa® in December 2017, we are building out the commercial team in the United States by hiring district managers and approximately 100 sales representatives during the first quarter of 2018, and also plan to contract for formulary coverage for Rhopressa® with U.S. payers for both commercial and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. We expect our sales organization to target approximately 12,000 high prescribing eye-care professionals throughout the United States. This sales force will initially be responsible for sales of Rhopressa®, and will also be responsible for sales of RoclatanTM, if approved.
Advance the development of RoclatanTM to approval. RoclatanTM achieved its primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating statistical superiority of RoclatanTM to each of its components in the Mercury 1 efficacy readout in September 2016 and in the Mercury 2 efficacy readout in May 2017. We expect to submit an NDA for RoclatanTM to the FDA in the second quarter of 2018, once we have 12-month stability data. 
Advance the development of Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM outside the United States to approval and commercialize on our own in Europe while likely securing a commercialization partner in Japan. Our strategy includes developing our business outside of North America, including obtaining regulatory approval on our own for Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM in Europe and Japan. We completed Rocket 4 for Rhopressa®, which was designed to generate adequate six-month safety data for European regulatory approval, and we expect to file for European regulatory approval of Rhopressa® in the second half of 2018. We initiated Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2017, which are designed in accordance with the requirements of Japan’s PMDA, as a precursor to Phase 3 registration trials that are expected to be subsequently conducted in Japan for potential regulatory submission of Rhopressa® in Japan. With respect to RoclatanTM, we commenced the Mercury 3 clinical trial in Europe during the third quarter of 2017, which is designed to compare RoclatanTM to Ganfort®, a fixed-dose combination product of bimatoprost, a PGA, and timolol, marketed in Europe. If Mercury 3 is successful, it is expected to improve our commercialization prospects in that region. We currently expect to read out topline 90-day efficacy data for the Mercury 3 trial in the first half of 2019 and to file for European regulatory approval of RoclatanTM by the end of 2019. If we obtain regulatory approval, we currently expect to commercialize Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM in Europe on our own, and likely partner for commercialization in Japan.

Continue to leverage and strengthen our intellectual property portfolio. We believe we have a strong intellectual property position relating to Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM. Our intellectual property portfolio contains U.S. and foreign patents and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications related to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use, and synthetic methods. We have patent protection for Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM in the United States through at least 2030.
Expand our product portfolio through internal discovery efforts, research collaboration arrangements and in-licensing or acquisitions of additional product candidates, products or technologies. We continue to seek to discover and develop new compounds in our research laboratories, and our scientific staff with expertise in medicinal chemistry, analytical chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology, pharmacology and pharmaceutical science are currently focused on evaluating our portfolio of owned Rho kinase inhibitors for additional indications within and beyond ophthalmology. In addition, we may enter into additional research collaborations or license arrangements or complete additional acquisitions to broaden our presence in ophthalmology, as we continually explore and discuss potential additional opportunities for new ophthalmic products, delivery alternatives and new therapeutic areas. We are currently exploring technologies for the delivery of our owned molecules to the back of the eye over sustained periods, and plan to pursue further development of our preclinical molecules and technologies focused on retinal diseases.
Glaucoma Overview
Glaucoma is generally characterized by relatively high IOP as a result of impaired drainage of fluid, known as aqueous humor, from the eye. The FDA recognizes sustained reduction of IOP, measured in terms of mmHg, as the primary clinical endpoint for regulatory approval, making clinical trials for this indication relatively straight-forward due to easily measured objective parameters.
In a healthy eye, aqueous humor is continuously produced and drained from the eye in order to maintain pressure equilibrium and provide micronutrients to various tissues in the eye. The normal range of IOP is generally between 10 and 21 mmHg. Several studies have demonstrated that the significant majority of glaucoma patients have IOPs below 26 mmHg at the time of diagnosis. An insufficient drainage of fluid can increase IOP above normal levels, which can eventually cause damage to the optic nerve. Once damaged, the optic nerve cannot regenerate and thus, damage to vision is permanent.
The most common form of glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma, which is characterized by abnormally high IOP as a result of impaired drainage of fluid from the eye’s primary drain, the TM. Open-angle glaucoma is a progressive disease leading to vision loss and blindness for some patients as a result of irreversible damage to the optic nerve.
Studies of the disease have demonstrated that reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma can help slow or halt further damage to the optic nerve and help preserve vision. Once diagnosed, glaucoma requires life-long treatment to maintain IOP at lower levels based on the individual patient’s risk of disease progression. Ophthalmologists will routinely determine a target IOP, which represents the desired IOP level to achieve with glaucoma therapy for an individual patient. Should the disease progress even once the initial target IOP is reached, further reduction of IOP has been shown to help in preventing additional damage to the optic nerve and further vision loss. This may require reducing IOP until it is in the so-called “low normal range” of 12 mmHg to 14 mmHg to protect the optic nerve from further damage.
There are multiple factors that can contribute to an individual developing open-angle glaucoma, including, but not limited to, age, family history and ethnicity. For example, there generally is a higher incidence and severity of the disease in African-American and Hispanic populations.
Some patients with high IOP are diagnosed with a condition known as ocular hypertension. Patients with ocular hypertension have high IOP without the loss of visual fields or observable damage to the optic nerve, and are at an increased risk of developing glaucoma. These patients are commonly treated in the same manner as glaucoma patients.

The following diagram illustrates how increased IOP eventually leads to increased pressure on the optic nerve, resulting in gradual loss of vision and ultimately visual disability and blindness. 
The ciliary body in the eye is the tissue that produces aqueous humor, the production of which is commonly referred to as fluid inflow. The fluid leaves the eye primarily through the TM, the process of which is commonly referred to as fluid outflow. The healthy eye maintains a state of IOP homeostasis through a constant physiological process of aqueous humor production and drainage. The deteriorating function of the TM in glaucoma leads to increased resistance to fluid outflow and higher IOP. There is also a secondary drain for the fluid in the eye known as the uveoscleral pathway, which is typically responsible for approximately 20% of fluid drainage.
In addition to aqueous humor production and drainage through the TM and uveoscleral pathway, episcleral venous pressure (“EVP”) plays a significant role in the regulation of IOP. EVP represents the pressure of the blood in the episcleral veins of the eye which are the site of drainage of eye fluid into the bloodstream. Historical studies have shown that EVP accounts for approximately 10 mmHg of IOP, or approximately one-half of IOP in patients with pressures near the normotensive level of 21 mmHg, and approximately one-third of IOP in patients with pressures of 24 mmHg to 30 mmHg. When EVP is lowered, aqueous humor is able to flow more freely from the eye.
Patients are diagnosed through measurements of IOP using Goldmann applanation tonometry, the standard device used by clinicians to measure IOP, along with an evaluation of visual fields and observing the appearance of the optic nerve. These tests are routinely carried out by eye-care professionals. The initial treatment for patients diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension is typically a PGA eye drop. PGAs are designed to reduce IOP by increasing outflow through the eye’s secondary fluid drain. An eye-care professional will then measure a patient’s response to the drug over the first few months. It has been shown that up to 50% of glaucoma patients require more than one drug to treat their IOP. This may occur as early as three to six months after initiating treatment with a PGA. The eye-care professionals may then add a second drug from one of the non-PGA classes, to be used together with the initial drug, or switch to a fixed-dose combination of two drugs in a single eye drop, or select an alternative single treatment. The reason so many patients eventually need more than one drug is generally considered to be a reflection of the progressive nature of the disease at the TM.
In severe glaucoma cases, patients may need to undergo an invasive surgical procedure. Trabeculectomy is the most common glaucoma-related surgical procedure, also referred to as filtration surgery, in which a piece of tissue in the drainage angle of the eye is removed, creating an opening to the outside of the eye. The opening is partially covered with a scleral flap, the white part of the eye, and the conjunctiva, the thin membrane covering the sclera. This new opening allows fluid to drain out of the eye, bypassing the clogged drainage channels of the TM to maintain a reduced IOP. Devices called shunts are used in glaucoma surgery to divert fluid in a controlled manner from the inside of the eye to the subconjunctival space bypassing the blocked TM. Generally, the shunts reduce IOP to the extent that the use of drops can be reduced, but often not completely eliminated. Many patients continue to require eye drops even following surgery.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from established branded and generic pharmaceutical companies, such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., Novartis International AG, Allergan, Inc., Santen Inc. and smaller biotechnology and pharmaceutical 
9

companies as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, which may in the future develop products or technologies to treat glaucoma or other diseases of the eye. Products that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM, if approved, are likely to be efficacy and their respective MOA(s), safety, convenience, price, tolerability and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.
We currently expect to compete directly against companies producing existing and future glaucoma treatment products. The most commonly approved classes of eye drops to reduce IOP in glaucoma are discussed below:
PGA Drug Class


• | Prostaglandin Analogues (“PGAs”). Most PGAs are once-daily dosed eye drops generally prescribed as the initial drug to reduce IOP by increasing fluid outflow through the eye’s secondary drain. They are thought to have little or no effect on the TM, the diseased tissue in glaucoma. PGAs represent approximately one-half of the U.S. and European prescription volume for the treatment of glaucoma.

Xalatan® (latanoprost), the best-selling PGA, together with Xalacom®, its fixed-dose combination with a beta blocker, which is not available in the United States, had worldwide peak sales of approximately $1.7 billion before its patent expired in 2012, according to publicly reported sales. The adverse effects of PGAs include conjunctival hyperemia, or eye redness, irreversible change in iris color, discoloration of the skin around the eyes, and droopiness of eyelids caused by the loss of orbital fat. PGAs should be used with caution in patients with a history of intraocular inflammation.
Non-PGA Drug Class


• | Beta Blockers. Beta blockers, with their MOA designed to inhibit aqueous production, are one of the oldest approved drugs for the reduction of IOP. The most commonly used drug in this class is timolol. Beta blockers are less effective than PGAs in terms of IOP reduction and are typically used twice daily. Beta blockers are the most commonly used non-PGA drug. They are used as an initially prescribed monotherapy and as an adjunctive therapy to PGAs when the efficacy of PGAs is insufficient. Beta blocker eye drops have contraindications in their label as a result of systemic exposure from topical application of the eye drops, potentially leading to cardio-pulmonary events such as bronchospasm, arrhythmia and heart failure.


• | Topical Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, with their MOA designed to inhibit aqueous production, are less effective than PGAs and are required to be dosed three times daily in order to obtain the desired IOP reduction. In published clinical studies of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, the most frequently reported adverse events reported were blurred vision and bitter, sour or unusual taste. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are sulfonamides and, as such, systemic exposure increases risk of adverse responses such as Stevens Johnson syndrome and blood dyscrasias.


• | Alpha Agonists. Alpha agonists, with their MOA designed to inhibit aqueous production plus their effect on uveoscleral outflow, are less effective than PGAs and need to be dosed three times daily in order to obtain the desired IOP reduction. In clinical studies, the most frequently reported adverse reactions that occurred in individuals receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution, a commonly prescribed alpha agonist, included allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival hyperemia, eye pruritus, burning sensation, conjunctival folliculosis, hypertension, ocular allergic reaction, oral dryness and visual disturbance.

Despite their modest efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles, the requirement for two to three doses per day, and the fact that they do not target the diseased tissue in glaucoma, beta blocker, carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and alpha agonist products account for up to one-half of the total prescription volume for the treatment of glaucoma based on historical prescription patterns, with beta blocker timolol being the most widely prescribed non-PGA drug. This is driven by the PGA products not being sufficiently effective as monotherapy for up to half of all glaucoma patients. Fixed-dose combination glaucoma products are also currently marketed in the United States, including Cosopt, the combination of a beta blocker with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, and Combigan, the combination of a beta blocker with an alpha agonist. There are no fixed-dose combinations of PGAs with other glaucoma drugs currently available in the United States.

New eye drops for the treatment of glaucoma continue to be developed by our competitors. The following table outlines publicly disclosed development programs for the treatment of glaucoma of which we are aware:

New MOA(s) 
Brand | MOA / Dosing | Status 
Rhopressa® (Aerie AR-13324) | ROCK inhibitor (qd) | U.S.: FDA-approvedEurope: Expect to submit MAA in the second half of 2018Japan: Phase 2
RoclatanTM (Aerie PG324) | ROCK inhibitor + PGA (qd) | U.S.: Expect to submit NDA to FDA in second quarter of 2018Europe: Phase 3 
New PGAs1 
Brand | MOA / Dosing | Status 
VyzultaTM (Valeant) | NO donating latanoprost (qd) | U.S.: FDA-approved 
DE-117 (Santen) | EP2 agonist (qd) | U.S.: Phase 2Japan: MAA filed in Japan 
DE-126 (Santen) | FP/EP3 agonist (qd) | U.S. and Japan: Phase 2 

1Not usable as add-on therapy to current PGAs. 
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. In November 2017, Bausch + Lomb Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., received FDA approval for a PGA indicated for the reduction of IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Early-stage companies are also developing treatments for glaucoma and other diseases of the eye and may prove to be significant competitors. We expect that our competitors will continue to develop new treatments for glaucoma and other diseases of the eye, which may include eye drops, oral treatments, surgical procedures, implantable devices or laser treatments. Alternative treatments beyond eye drops continue to develop.
Early-stage companies may also compete through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer adverse effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.
Our industry is highly competitive and is currently dominated by generic drugs, such as latanoprost and timolol, in the case of glaucoma treatment, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. Our ability to compete may be affected because in many cases insurers or other third-party payers encourage the use of generic products. We expect that Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM, if approved, will be priced at a premium over competitive generic products and consistent with other branded glaucoma drugs.
Sales and Marketing
FDA approval means that we can begin marketing Rhopressa® for the approved indication in the United States and we are implementing our plans to do so. We expect to launch Rhopressa® in the United States by mid-second quarter of 2018, and we anticipate having the first commercial sale within the United States by mid-2018. We are commercializing Rhopressa® and plan to commercialize RoclatanTM, if approved, in the United States with our own focused, specialized sales force. For the launch of Rhopressa®, we are in the process of hiring a commercial team that will include approximately 100 sales representatives to target approximately 12,000 high prescribing eye-care professionals throughout the United States. This sales force will initially be responsible for sales of Rhopressa®, and will also be responsible for sales of RoclatanTM, if approved.
11

We also plan to contract for formulary coverage for Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM, if approved, with U.S. payers for both commercial and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, and have started that process. We expect to obtain preferred formulary coverage for the majority of commercial payers for Rhopressa® by late 2018 and formulary coverage with the majority of Medicare Part D plans expected to commence in 2019.
Outside of the United States, if we obtain regulatory approval, we currently expect to commercialize Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM in Europe on our own, and likely partner for commercialization in Japan.
Manufacturing
We currently rely on our third-party manufacturers to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient and final drug product for clinical trials. Latanoprost, used in the manufacture of RoclatanTM, is available in commercial quantities from multiple reputable third-party manufacturers. We intend to procure quantities on a purchase order basis for our clinical and commercial production. 
With respect to commercial production of Rhopressa®, we plan on outsourcing the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. The commercial production of the final drug product is ultimately expected to be supported by a combination of internal and outsourced manufacturing. We have entered into a contractual relationship for drug product manufacturing for the commercialization of Rhopressa®. Our current contract manufacturer started producing commercial supply of Rhopressa® prior to Rhopressa® obtaining FDA approval in anticipation of such approval. We are also in the process of adding a second contract manufacturer, which we expect may produce commercial supply by as early as the end of 2018.
To date, our third-party manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements for clinical trials and our third-party manufacturer for Rhopressa® has passed a pre-approval inspection conducted by the FDA. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM to meet our anticipated clinical and commercial demands. If our existing third-party suppliers should become unavailable to us for any reason, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements, although we would experience a delay in our ability to obtain alternative suppliers.
In January 2017, we entered into a lease agreement for a new manufacturing plant in Athlone, Ireland. The building shell was constructed by the Industrial Development Agency of Ireland and we are currently building-out the plant. This will be our first manufacturing plant, which is expected to produce commercial supplies of Rhopressa® and, if approved, RoclatanTM, with commercial product supply from the plant expected to be available by 2020. The build-out of this manufacturing plant will require substantial funds and we need to continue to hire and train significant numbers of qualified employees to staff this facility.
We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. However, should a supplier or manufacturer on which we have relied to produce Rhopressa®, RoclatanTM or any future product candidate provides us with a faulty product or such product is later recalled, we would likely experience reputational harm, delays and additional costs, each of which could be significant.
Research and Development Expenses 
A significant portion of our operating expenses relates to research and development. Our research and development expenses totaled $72.1 million, $52.4 million, and $44.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Intellectual Property
We have obtained patent protection for Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM (patent protection for RoclatanTM arises from the patent protection we have secured for Rhopressa®), in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, including in Europe, Asia and the rest of the world, and will seek and are seeking patent protection in additional foreign jurisdictions from time to time as we deem appropriate. We intend to maintain and defend our patent rights to protect our technology, inventions, processes and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. Our existing patents or patents we obtain in the future may not be commercially useful in protecting our technology. In addition, our patents may not issue on any of our pending patent applications or patent applications we file in the future. Our commercial success also depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Our intellectual property consists of issued patents, and pending patent applications for compositions of matter, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use, and synthetic methods. We have patent protection for Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM in the United 
12

States through at least 2030. Additionally, we hold patents for composition of matter and method of use in certain foreign jurisdictions for Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM through dates ranging from 2030 to 2037. We also hold patents for other ROCK inhibitor molecules.
The following table summarizes the status of our pending and existing patents and patent applications:

Country | Number of Issued Patents | Number of Pending Patents | Estimated Expiration Date Range
United States | 21 | 14 | 2026 - 2038 
Australia | 3 | 4 | 2029 - 2036

Aerie® and Rhopressa® are registered trademarks of ours and we have an application pending from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) for the registration of our trademark RoclatanTM and for other trademarks.
In 2015, we revised our corporate structure to align with our business strategy outside of North America by establishing Aerie Pharmaceuticals Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary (“Aerie Limited”), and Aerie Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary (“Aerie Ireland Limited”). We assigned the beneficial rights to our non-U.S. and non-Canadian intellectual property for Rhopressa® and RoclatanTM to Aerie Limited (the “IP Assignment”). As part of the IP Assignment, we and Aerie Limited entered into a research and development cost-sharing agreement pursuant to which we and Aerie Limited will share the costs of the development of intellectual property and Aerie Limited and Aerie Ireland Limited entered into a license arrangement pursuant to which Aerie Ireland Limited will develop and commercialize the beneficial rights of the intellectual property assigned as part of the IP Assignment. In 2016, we assigned the beneficial rights to certain of our intellectual property in the United States and Canada to Aerie Distribution, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary (“Aerie Distribution”), and amended and restated the research and development cost sharing agreement to transfer our rights and obligations under the agreement to Aerie Distribution.
Regulatory Matters
FDA Regulation and Marketing Approval
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and related regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions and non-approval of product candidates. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA or an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) of a clinical hold on trials, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or related supplements, withdrawal of an approval, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Such actions by government agencies could also require us to expend a large amount of resources to respond to the actions. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
13

The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the research, clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products.
These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, post-approval monitoring, advertising, promotion, sampling and import and export of our products. Our drugs must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. See “—The NDA Approval Process” below.
The process required by the FDA before drugs may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices or other applicable regulations;


• | submission of an IND, which allows clinical trials to begin unless FDA objects within 30 days;


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use or uses conducted in accordance with FDA regulations, Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), which are international ethical and scientific quality standards meant to assure the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, investigators, administrators, and monitors;


• | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites; and


• | FDA approval of an NDA, which must occur before a drug can be marketed or sold.

IND and Clinical Trials
Prior to commencing the first clinical trial, an initial IND, which contains the results of preclinical tests along with other information, such as information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed protocol, must be submitted to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial within the 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during product development. Further, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. Informed consent must also be obtained from each trial subject. Regulatory authorities, including the FDA, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements.
For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in sequential phases that may overlap:

• | Phase 1—the drug is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. These trials may also provide early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.


• | Phase 2—trials are conducted in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 registration trials.


• | Phase 3—when Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range of the product appears effective and has an acceptable safety profile, and provide sufficient information for the design of Phase 3 registration trials, Phase 3 registration trials are undertaken to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval by the FDA. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug.

14

All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations, GCP requirements and their protocols in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes.
In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug. 
An investigational drug product that is a combination of two different drugs in the same dosage form must comply with an additional rule that requires that each component make a contribution to the claimed effects of the drug product. This typically requires larger studies that test the drug against each of its components. In addition, typically, if a drug product is intended to treat a chronic disease, as is the case with our products, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time, which can range from six months to three years or more. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates or new drugs for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
The NDA Approval Process
In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication. Each NDA submission requires a substantial user fee payment (currently exceeding $2.4 million for fiscal year 2018) unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent non-clinical, preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators that meet GCP requirements.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meetings to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 registration trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drugs. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life.
The results of product development, non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. An NDA must also contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indication in all relevant pediatric populations. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it files them. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA files it. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to conduct an initial review to determine whether the application will be filed based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If the NDA submission is filed, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured 
15

in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA has agreed to specific performance goals on the review of NDAs and seeks to review standard NDAs in 12 months from submission of the NDA. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. After the FDA completes its initial review of an NDA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the drug will either be approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that the NDA will not be approved in its current form and inform the sponsor of changes that must be made or additional clinical, non-clinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the application can be approved, with no implication regarding the ultimate approvability of the application or the timing of any such approval, if ever. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two to six months depending on the type of information included. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP, the FDA may determine the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the NDA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase 4 trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. In addition, the FDA now has express statutory authority to require sponsors to conduct post-marketing trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency. See “—Post-Marketing Requirements” below.
The FDA also has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the NDA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the NDA. Based on statutory standards, elements of a REMS may include “dear doctor letters,” a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. These elements are negotiated as part of the NDA approval, and in some cases if consensus is not obtained until after the PDUFA review cycle, the approval date may be delayed. Once adopted, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, including relevant pediatric data, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution, or post-marketing trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. We cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.
Adverse Event Reporting
The FDA requires reporting of certain information on side effects and adverse events reported during clinical studies and after marketing approval. Non-compliance with FDA safety reporting requirements may result in FDA regulatory action that may include civil action or criminal penalties. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede 
16

or prevent marketing approval. Similarly, adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the product's use and, potentially, withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market.
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, a portion of a product’s U.S. patent term that was lost during clinical development and regulatory review by the FDA may be restored. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide a process for listing patents pertaining to approved products in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the “Orange Book”) and for a competitor seeking approval of an application that references a product with listed patents to make certifications pertaining to such patents. In addition, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments provide for a statutory protection, known as non-patent exclusivity, against the FDA’s acceptance or approval of certain competitor applications.
Patent Term Restoration
Patent term restoration can compensate for time lost during product development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. Patent term restorations, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
Orange Book Listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims covering the applicant’s product or method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents identified in the application for the drug are then published in the FDA’s Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a Section VIII statement certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been filed by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
An applicant submitting an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, is required to certify to the FDA regarding any patents listed in the Orange Book for the approved product it references to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
17

Market Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity (“NCE”). A drug is entitled to NCE exclusivity if it contains a drug substance no active moiety of which has been previously approved by the FDA. This means that, in the case of a fixed-dose combination product, the FDA makes the NCE exclusivity determination for each drug substance in the drug product and not for the drug product as a whole. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification. For a drug that has been previously approved by the FDA, the FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the new conditions of use and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs for the original conditions of use, such as the originally approved indication. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Post-Marketing Requirements
Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, who may or may not grant approval or may include in a lengthy review process.
Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”), a part of the FDCA. In addition, Title II of the Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act or the DSCSA, has imposed new “track and trace” requirements on the distribution of prescription drug products by manufacturers, distributors, and other entities in the drug supply chain. These requirements are being phased in over a ten-year period. The DSCSA ultimately will require product identifiers (i.e., serialization) on prescription drug products in order to establish an electronic interoperable prescription product system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States. The DSCSA replaced the prior drug “pedigree” requirements under the PDMA, and preempts existing state drug pedigree laws and regulations. The DSCSA also establishes new requirements for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third-party logistic providers. These licensing requirements preempt states from imposing licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or otherwise encompassed by standards established by FDA pursuant to the DSCSA. Until FDA promulgates regulations to address the DSCSA’s new national licensing standard, current state licensing requirements typically remain in effect.
In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific facilities and in accordance with cGMP. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for 
18

the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such product or may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, the applicant under an approved NDA is subject to an annual program fee (replacing the old product and establishment fees), currently exceeding $300,000 per prescription drug product for fiscal year 2018. 
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, also known as Phase 4 testing, REMS to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, withdrawal of approval, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
Reimbursement, Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws and Other Regulatory Matters
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, state Attorneys General and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, as amended, the privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), as amended, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive regulatory approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-government payers.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our products, if any such products or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product 
19

could adversely affect the sales of our products. If third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our potential products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
As noted above, in the United States, we are subject to complex laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including, but not limited to, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal False Claims Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws, the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions, and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future sales and marketing practices and/or our future relationships with eye-care professionals might be challenged under anti-kickback laws, which could harm us. Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we have developed a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject.
The Federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payers, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been found liable under the Federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,000 and $25,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the Federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the Federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the Federal False Claims Act.
There are also an increasing number of state laws with requirements for manufacturers and/or marketers of pharmaceutical products. Some states require the reporting of expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and the reporting of gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justification of price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging. In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, as discussed below, a similar federal requirement requires manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state, and soon federal, authorities.
20

The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by required, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Government Programs for Marketed Drugs
Medicaid, the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and Medicare
Federal law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer, as a condition of having its products receive federal reimbursement under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, must pay rebates to state Medicaid programs for all units of its covered outpatient drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program under either a fee-for-service arrangement or through a managed care organization. This federal requirement is effectuated through a Medicaid drug rebate agreement between the manufacturer and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. CMS administers the Medicaid drug rebate agreements, which provide, among other things, that the drug manufacturer will pay rebates to each state Medicaid agency on a quarterly basis and report certain price information on a monthly and quarterly basis. The rebates are based on prices reported to CMS by manufacturers for their covered outpatient drugs. For innovator products, that is, drugs that are marketed under approved NDAs, the basic rebate amount is the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price (“AMP”) for the quarter or the difference between such AMP and the best price for that same quarter. The AMP is the weighted average of prices paid to the manufacturer (1) directly by retail community pharmacies and (2) by wholesalers for drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies. The best price is essentially the lowest price available to non-governmental entities. Innovator products are also subject to an additional rebate that is based on the amount, if any, by which the product’s current AMP has increased over the baseline AMP, which is the AMP for the first full quarter after launch, adjusted for inflation. For non-innovator products, generally generic drugs marketed under approved abbreviated new drug applications, the basic rebate amount is 13% of the AMP for the quarter. Until recent amendments to the statute, this was the only rebate applicable to non-innovator products. However, as a result of a November 2015 amendment, non-innovator products are subject to an additional rebate. The additional rebate is similar to that discussed above for innovator products, except that the baseline AMP quarter is the fifth full quarter after launch (for non-innovator multiple source drugs launched on April 1, 2013 or later) or the third quarter of 2014 (for those launched before April 1, 2013). The statutory definition of AMP was amended in 2010 by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, “PPACA”). In February 2016, CMS published a final rule to further define AMP and provide clarification on other parts of the rebate program.
The terms of participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in additional or lesser rebate liability, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates, if a manufacturer were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information.
A manufacturer must also participate in a federal program known as the 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available to pay for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Under this program, the participating manufacturer agrees to charge certain safety net healthcare providers no more than an established discounted price for its covered outpatient drugs. The formula for determining the discounted price is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and the unit rebate amount as calculated under the Medicaid drug rebate program, discussed above. Manufacturers have not been required to report any pricing information to the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”), but HRSA issued a notice proposing to collect such information from manufacturers on a quarterly basis and is in the process of preparing a system to operationalize this requirement. HRSA has also issued regulations relating to the calculation of the ceiling price as well as imposition of civil monetary penalties for each instance of knowingly and intentionally overcharging a 340B covered entity. 
Federal law also requires that manufacturers report data on a quarterly basis to CMS regarding the pricing of drugs that are separately reimbursable under Medicare Part B. These are generally drugs, such as injectable products, that are administered “incident to” a physician service and are not generally self-administered. The pricing information submitted by manufacturers is the basis for reimbursement to physicians and suppliers for drugs covered under Medicare Part B. As with the Medicaid drug rebate program, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information.
21

Medicare Part D provides prescription drug benefits for seniors and people with disabilities. Medicare Part D beneficiaries have a gap in their coverage (between the initial coverage limit and the point at which catastrophic coverage begins) where Medicare does not cover their prescription drug costs, known as the coverage gap. However, by 2020, Medicare Part D beneficiaries will pay 25% of drug costs after they reach the initial coverage limit - the same percentage they were responsible for before they reached that limit - thereby closing the coverage gap. The cost of closing the coverage gap is being borne by innovator companies and the government through subsidies. Beginning in 2011, each manufacturer of drugs approved under NDAs was required to enter into a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount agreement and provide a 50% discount on those drugs dispensed to Medicare beneficiaries in the coverage gap, in order for its drugs to be reimbursed by Medicare Part D. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the manufacturer’s subsidy under this program from 50% to 70% of the negotiated price, beginning in 2019.
Federal Contracting/Pricing Requirements
Manufacturers are also required to make their covered drugs, which are generally drugs approved under NDAs, available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”), of the General Services Administration. The law also requires manufacturers to offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing for purchases of their covered drugs by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense (“DoD”), the Coast Guard, and the Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service) in order for federal funding to be available for reimbursement or purchase of the manufacturer’s drugs under certain federal programs. FSS pricing to those four federal agencies for covered drugs must be no more than the Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”), which is at least 24% below the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (“Non-FAMP”) for the prior year. The Non-FAMP is the average price for covered drugs sold to wholesalers or other middlemen, net of any price reductions. 
The accuracy of a manufacturer’s reported Non-FAMPs, FCPs, or FSS contract prices may be audited by the government. Among the remedies available to the government for inaccuracies is recoupment of any overcharges to the four specified federal agencies based on those inaccuracies. If a manufacturer were found to have knowingly reported false prices, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the law provides for civil monetary penalties of $100,000 per incorrect item. Finally, manufacturers are required to disclose in FSS contract proposals all commercial pricing that is equal to or less than the proposed FSS pricing, and subsequent to award of an FSS contract, manufacturers are required to monitor certain commercial price reductions and extend commensurate price reductions to the government, under the terms of the FSS contract Price Reductions Clause. Among the remedies available to the government for any failure to properly disclose commercial pricing and/or to extend FSS contract price reductions is recoupment of any FSS overcharges that may result from such omissions. 
Tricare Retail Pharmacy Network Program
The DoD provides pharmacy benefits to current and retired military service members and their families through the Tricare healthcare program. When a Tricare beneficiary obtains a prescription drug through a retail pharmacy, the DoD reimburses the pharmacy at the retail price for the drug rather than procuring it from the manufacturer at the discounted FCP discussed above. In order for the DoD to realize discounted prices for covered drugs (generally drugs approved under NDAs), federal law requires manufacturers to pay refunds on utilization of their covered drugs sold to Tricare beneficiaries through retail pharmacies in DoD’s Tricare network. These refunds are generally the difference between the Non-FAMP and the FCP and are due on a quarterly basis. Absent an agreement from the manufacturer to provide such refunds, DoD will designate the manufacturer’s products as Tier 3 (non-formulary) and require that beneficiaries obtain prior authorization in order for the products to be dispensed at a Tricare retail network pharmacy. However, refunds are due whether or not the manufacturer has entered into such an agreement. 
Branded Pharmaceutical Fee
A branded pharmaceutical fee is imposed on manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs, generally drugs approved under NDAs. In each year between 2011 and 2018, the aggregate fee for all such manufacturers will range from $2.5 billion to $4.1 billion, and then will remain at $2.8 billion in 2019 and subsequent years. This annual fee is apportioned among the participating companies based on each company’s sales of qualifying products to or utilization by certain U.S. government programs during the preceding calendar year. The fee became effective January 1, 2011, and is not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Utilization of generic drugs, generally drugs approved under ANDAs, is not included in a manufacturer’s sales used to calculate its portion of the fee. 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
In March 2010, the PPACA was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:
22



• | As discussed above, effective in 2010, PPACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic agents to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. PPACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. CMS expanded Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well, effective April 1, 2020. In addition, PPACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the CMS, beginning in April 2016, also provided for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales.


• | Effective in 2010, PPACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication.


• | Effective in 2011, PPACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic agents to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”). The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the manufacturer’s subsidy under this program from 50% to 70% of the negotiated price, beginning in 2019.


• | Effective in 2011, PPACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications.


• | PPACA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers were required to track this information beginning in 2013, and the first reports were due in 2014. The information reported each year is made publicly available on a searchable website.


• | As of 2010, a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute was established pursuant to PPACA to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products.


• | PPACA created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which has the authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings.


• | PPACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.

There have been efforts by the Trump Administration and Congress to seek repeal of all or portions of PPACA. There is uncertainty with respect to the impact these changes, if any, may have, and any changes likely will take time to unfold.
European Union Drug Development
In the European Union (“EU”), our products and product candidates will also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained, and the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trial regulatory framework for pharmaceuticals by setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent 
23

Authority (“NCA”) and one or more Ethics Committees (“ECs”). All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial must be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. All clinical trials will have to conform to current Good Clinical Practice guidelines issued by the EU and the International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, in particular when the results of such trials are being used in marketing authorization procedures, and audits by EU inspectors on regulatory conformance of such clinical trials are likely.
In 2014, the new EU Clinical Trial Regulation 546/2014 was enacted. When it becomes applicable (currently expected beginning in 2019), it will govern all newly-commenced clinical trials. The new Regulation aims to make more uniform and streamline the clinical trials authorization process, ensure consistent rules for conducting clinical trials throughout the EU, increase the efficiency of clinical trials, and increase the transparency of authorization, conduct and results of clinical trials. All currently conducted clinical trials remain subjected to the Clinical Trials Directive of 2001. 
Generally, in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), for every product candidate, a pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”) will have to be submitted and approval be obtained, in addition to clinical trials conducted in adults. The clinical studies that sponsoring companies must carry out on children are to be set out in detail in the PIP. In most cases, the PIP will become a commitment when applying for a marketing authorization for a product candidate.
European Union Drug Review Approval
In the EEA, which is currently comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). There are two types of marketing authorizations in the EEA: the Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), a body of the EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA; and the National MA, which is issued by the competent authorities of each Member State of the EEA and only authorizes marketing in that Member State’s national territory and not in the EEA as a whole.
The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. The National MA is for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (“RMS”). If the RMS proposes to authorize the product, and the other Member States do not raise objections, the product is granted a national MA in all the Member States where the authorization was sought. Before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
Brexit
Unless otherwise agreed with the other member states of the EU, the United Kingdom will leave the EU in March 2019 (“Brexit”). As one of the Brexit consequences, the EMA will relocate from London to Amsterdam. It is unclear what impacts Brexit will have with respect to the cross-border acknowledgment of clinical trial results and marketing authorizations.
Other Countries
In addition to regulations in the United States and the EU, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our potential products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. In addition, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, commercial sales, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.

Other Regulations
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. In addition, our international operations and relationships with partners, collaborators, contract research organizations, vendors and other agents are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Failure to comply with the FCPA, or similar applicable laws and regulations in other countries, could expose us and our personnel to civil and criminal sanctions. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Employees
We had 160 full-time employees as of December 31, 2017. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees.
