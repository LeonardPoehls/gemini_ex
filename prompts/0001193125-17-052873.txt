 Market Opportunity 
 U.S. K-12 Market is Large and Growing 
 In the United States, which is our primary market in which we sell educational content for both public and private schools, the K-12 education market represents one of the largest industry segments, accounting for over $696 billion of expenditures, or about 4.0% of the 2011 U.S. gross domestic product as measured by the U.S Educations National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) for the 2014-2015 school year. The instructional supplies and services component of this market was estimated to be approximately $30 billion in 2011 and is expected to continue growing as a result of several secular and cyclical factors. From 2000-2001 to 2010-2011, current expenditures per student in public elementary and secondary schools increased by 14%, after adjusting for inflation. However, there can be no assurance that the U.S. K-12 market will grow. 
 
4 
 
In addition to its size, the U.S. K-12 education market is highly decentralized and is characterized by complex content adoption processes. It is comprised of approximately 13,500 public school districts across the 50 states and 132,000 public and private elementary and secondary schools. While we believe certain initiatives in the education sector such as the Common Core State Standards, a set of mathematics and English language arts standards, and Next Generation Science Standards, a set of science standards, each benchmarked to international standards, have increased standardization in K-12 education content, we also believe significant state standard specific customization still exists, and we believe the need to address customization provides an ongoing need for companies in the industry to maintain relationships with individual state and district policymakers and expertise in state-varying academic standards. 
 Growth in the U.S. K-12 market for educational materials and services is driven by, among other factors, the fiscal condition of state governments and school districts and, in particular, by the level of funding for public education generated by state and local tax collections. While the market has historically grown above the pace of inflation, averaging 7.2% growth annually since 1969, the sharp declines in tax revenues stemming from the 2008-2009 recession created a difficult operating environment for states and school districts, leading many to defer spending on educational materials and services. State and local tax receipts began to rebound in 2010 and have continued to grow, driving seven consecutive years of higher state general revenue spending and a much improved funding environment for K-12 institutions, although there are some indications that the rate of growth may be slowing, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers Fall 2016 Fiscal Survey of the States and there can be no assurance of any further improvement or that it will be significant. 
 State adoptions of instructional materials, which were often deferred during the recession, have for the most part returned to regular, pre-recession cyclical patterns. California purchased English language arts materials in 2016 and will continue such purchases in 2017 and 2018; Texas is scheduled to purchase in world languages in 2017, and is scheduled to adopt English language arts in 2018 (for purchase in 2019 and subsequent years); and Florida is slated to purchase new social studies programs in 2017 and subsequent years, and to adopt science programs in 2017 (for purchase in 2018 and subsequent years). We also expect modest growth in open territories. 
 Long-term growth in the U.S. K-12 education market is positively correlated with student enrollments. From 2013-2014 to 2025-2026, total public school enrollment is projected to increase by 3% to 51.4 million students, according to NCES. 
 In addition, increased investment in areas of government policy focus is expected to further drive market growth. We believe the adoption of new academic standards in many states, including states that have adopted the Common Core State Standards in mathematics and English language arts and states adopting or contemplating adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards, is also expanding the market for teacher professional development and school improvement services. 
 We estimate that our U.S. K-12 educational addressable market is expected to be approximately in the range of $2.6 billion to $3.2 billion from 2015 through 2019. We define our addressable market as the market that we primarily compete in with our products, with the exception of our trade products, our cognitive and summative assessment products, professional development products and products sold internationally. 
 Expansion of Market Opportunities 
 In the U.S. educational market, intervention and supplemental materials, professional services and early learning (pre-K) programs have demonstrated growth in recent years. Demand for intervention materials is significant and growing in the United States. More than 60 percent of students enrolled in the public school environment perform below their grade level and are strong candidates for intervention programs both in literacy and in mathematics. Demand for teacher training and professional development opportunities tied to the implementation of new or revised standards at the state level is expected to continue as there will be a significant 
 
5 
 
 number of new teachers entering the workforce over the next several years. Also, according to a January 2016 report from the Education Commission of the States, state funding for pre-K programs in FY 2015 totaled nearly $7 billion, representing a 12% increase over the prior year. This growing emphasis on early childhood education is further evidenced by language in recently enacted legislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) now known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), that authorizes continued funding for Preschool Development Grants, with an increased focus on coordinating programs, ensuring quality, and broadening access to early childhood education. 
 Increasing Focus on Accountability and Student Outcomes 
 U.S. K-12 education has come under significant political scrutiny in recent years, due to recognition of its importance to the U.S. society at large and concern over the perceived decline in U.S. students competitiveness relative to their international peers. An independent task force report published in March of 2012 by the Council on Foreign Relations, a non-partisan membership organization and think tank, observed that American students rank far behind global leaders in international tests of literacy, math and science, and concluded that the current state of U.S. education severely impairs the United States economic, military and diplomatic security as well as broader components of Americas global leadership. 
 These concerns helped lead to the passage in 2002 of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), which ushered in an era of stricter accountability, higher standards and increased transparency in education. Since the enactment of NCLB, states have been required to measure progress towards these standards through annual student testing and make results, disaggregated by demographic sub-group, publicly available. In 2010 the Common Core State Standards, new academic standards in math and English language arts developed under the auspices of governors and state chief school officers, were released. Forty-six states and the District of Columbia initially adopted the new standards. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which reauthorized and overhauled the ESEA and replaced the NCLB, allows states greater flexibility in how to carry out federal mandates but retain NCLBs focus on accountability, standards and transparency, including NCLBs requirements for annual student testing and disaggregated score reporting. 
 This heightened focus on accountability and international competitiveness and the adoption of new, more rigorous standards has elevated the importance of, and helped drive demand for, high-quality content that is aligned with these standards and empowers educators to meet new requirements. Schools have also increased their expenditures on services and professional development for educators that support teachers in implementing new programs effectively and provide district and school leaders with data management and assessment capabilities to measure progress. Although this trend may lead to increases in spending by schools and districts, educational mandates and expenditures can also be affected by other factors. 
 Growing Shift Towards Digital Materials 
 In the U.S. K-12 education market, an increasing number of schools are utilizing digital content in their classrooms and implementing online or blended learning environments, which mix the use of print and digital educational materials in the classroom. Technologies are also being adapted for educational uses via digital platforms, which permit the sharing of digital files and programs among multiple computers, mobile, or other devices in real time through a virtual network. 
 While the speed of technology adoption within the U.S. K-12 education market differs across districts and states due to varying resources and infrastructure, most schools are implementing more technology and are seeking partners to help them create effective digital learning environments. In some cases, districts are requiring providers of instructional materials to include flexible digital components in their offerings, and are exploring subscription-based models for acquiring content. Many educators also believe that the increased implementation of digital learning environments will enable the widespread use of learning analytics, which enhance the ability 
 
6 
 
 to monitor effectiveness and learning outcomes to ultimately help schools build better pedagogical methods, personalize learning, identify and support at-risk students and improve student retention. As demand for digital content and personalized learning solutions is growing, traditional distinctions between core, supplemental and intervention materials and assessments are blurring. 
 Rising Global Demand for Education 
 The global education market, especially in Asia and the Middle East, is experiencing rising enrollments and increasing government and consumer spending driven by the close connection between levels of educational attainment, evolving standards, personal career prospects and economic growth that will increase the demand for English language products. Population growth is a leading indicator for pre-primary school enrollments, which have a subsequent impact on secondary and higher education enrollments. Globally, according to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), rapid population growth has caused pre-primary enrollments in recent decadesin 2012, 184 million children were enrolled in pre-primary education worldwide, an increase of nearly two-thirds since 1999. Additionally, according to the United Nations, the world population of 7.4 billion in 2016 is projected to reach 9.9 billion by 2050, up 33% from 2016, as countries develop and improvements in medical conditions increase the birth rate. 
 Currently, we focus our offerings in international markets on English language education and instructional products. 
 Our Industry 
 K-12 Instructional Materials 
 Core Instructional Materials 
 In the U.S., K-12 core curriculum programs provides educational content and assessments to over 55.0 million students across approximately 132,000 public and private elementary and secondary schools. Core programs cover curriculum standards in a particular subject and include a comprehensive offering of teacher and student materials necessary to conduct the class throughout the year. Products and services include students print and digital offerings and a variety of supporting materials such as teachers editions, formative assessments, supplemental materials, whole group instruction materials, practice aids, educational games and services. 
 Core curriculum programs traditionally have been the primary resource for classroom instruction in most K-12 academic subjects, and as a result, enrollment trends are a major driver of industry growth. Although economic cycles may affect short-term buying patterns, school enrollments, a driver of growth in the educational content industry, are highly predictable and are expected to trend upward over the longer term. 
 Demand for core curriculum programs is also affected by changes in state curriculum standards, which drive instruction, assessment, and accountability in each state. A significant change in state curriculum standards requires that assessments, teacher training programs, and instructional materials be revised or replaced to align to the new standards, which historically has driven demand for new comprehensive curriculum programs. 
 The majority of states have recently transitioned to or are in the process of transitioning to new curriculum standards in two of the most important subject areas, mathematics and English language arts. For the most part, these new standards are based on the Common Core State Standards, the product of a multi-state effort to establish a single set of content standards in mathematics and English language arts for grades K-12. Forty-six states and the District of Columbia initially adopted the Common Core State Standards, and, while some states have nominally moved away from the standards, a majority of the original adopting states continue to use Common Core State Standards or curriculum standards closely based on them. Many states also have recently adopted or are in the process of developing new science standards, including 16 states that have adopted the multi-state Next Generation Science Standards. Most of these states are administering new student assessments aligned to the new standards.

Instructional Material Adoption Process 
 The process through which materials and curricula are selected and procured for classroom use varies throughout the United States. In nineteen states, known as adoption states, new programs are evaluated at the state level, usually every six to eight years, for alignment to standards and other criteria. Individual school districts then purchase instructional materials for local use, typically from the state-approved list, although in some adoption states districts are permitted to purchase instructional materials that are not on the state list, including textbooks, supplemental materials, digital media, digital courseware and online services. In all remaining states, known as open states or open territories, each individual school or school district evaluates and purchases materials independently and at any time, typically according to a five to ten year cycle. 
 The following chart illustrates the current adoption and open states: 
 


The student population in adoption states represents approximately 50% of the U.S. elementary and secondary school-age population. A number of adoption states, and a few open territory states, provide categorical state funding for instructional materials; that is, funds that cannot be used for any purpose other than to purchase instructional content or, in some cases, technology equipment used to deliver instruction. In some states, categorical instructional materials funds can be used only for the purchase of materials on the state-approved list. In states that do not provide categorical state instructional materials funding, districts pay for materials primarily out of general state formula aid and/or local funds. 
 In adoption states, the state education boards decision to approve a certain program developed by an educational content provider depends on recommendations from instructional materials review committees, which are often comprised of educators and curriculum specialists. Such committees typically recommend a program if it aligns to the states educational content standards. To ensure the approval and subsequent success of a new instructional materials program, educational content providers conduct extensive market research, which may include: discussions of the planned curriculum with state-level curriculum advisors to secure their support; development of prototype instructional materials that are focus-tested with educators, often against competing programs, to gather feedback on the programs content and design; and incorporation of qualitative input from existing customers in terms of classroom needs. 
 In open territory states, the procurement process is typically characterized by a presentation and the provision of sample materials to district-level instructional materials selection committees, which subsequently evaluate and recommend a particular program to district officials and school boards. Products are generally customized to meet the states curriculum standards with similar research methods as in adoption states. 
 We believe that a content providers ultimate success in a given state will depend on a variety of factors, including the quality of its programs and materials, alignment with state standards and the effectiveness of its marketing and sales efforts. As a result, educational content providers often implement formal market research efforts that include educator focus groups, prototypes of student and ancillary materials and comparisons against 
 
8 
 
 competing products. At the same time, marketing and editorial staffs work closely together to incorporate the results of research into products, while developing the most up-to-date, research- and needs-based curricula. 
 Intervention and Supplemental Materials 
 Intervention and supplemental materials include a wide range of product offerings targeted at addressing specific needs in key subject areas, such as literacy and mathematics. They provide students in need of targeted support with additional instruction, knowledge and practice as well as supplemental materials and solutions that educators can use in addition to core curriculum to tailor education programs for their classrooms. Intervention solutions are generally purchased by individual schools or districts, while supplemental materials are generally purchased by individual teachers whose purchases are not tied to adoption schedules. Demand for intervention materials is significant and growing in the United States. More than 60 percent of students enrolled in the public school environment perform below their grade level and are strong candidates for intervention programs both in literacy and mathematics. As demand for digital content and personalized learning solutions is growing, traditional distinctions between core, supplemental and intervention materials and assessments are blurring. 
 Intervention and supplemental products and services are funded through state and local funding as well as federal funding allocations pursuant to the ESSA and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Title I, the largest program within ESSA, provides funding to schools and school districts with high concentrations of students from low income families. Title I and other ESSA programs also provide targeted funding for specific activities, such as early childhood education, school improvement, response to intervention, dropout prevention, and before- and after-school programs. IDEA governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education and related services to children with disabilities. In addition, school districts in many states are now able to spend educational funds on instructional materials that include core and supplemental materials, computer software, digital media, digital courseware, and online services. 
 Professional Services 
 The Professional Services includes consulting and support services to assist individual schools and school districts in raising student achievement, implementing new programs and technology effectively, developing effective teachers, principals and leaders, as well as school and school-district turnaround and improvement solutions. We believe all districts and schools contract for some level of professional services. These services may include support for up-front training, in-classroom coaching, institutes, author workshops, professional learning communities, leadership development, technical support and maintenance, and program management. Historically, it has been challenging to measure the success of these investments or sustain their effects owing to the fragmented nature of initiatives and providers in a single district as well as the lack of sustained plans. 
 Professional development is directly addressed in ESSA. ESSA restructured Title II, the section of the law addressing teacher quality, and authorized over $2 billion in grants to support activities that promote teacher and principal effectiveness. ESSA also eliminated federal highly qualified teacher requirements and prohibits U.S. Department of Education mandates and incentives to evaluate teachers on the basis of student test scores, which in recent years have channeled resources and attention to the development of educator evaluation systems, measurement tools, and related training. Title II now focuses instead on the role of the profession in improving student achievement, including new requirements to ensure professional development is not only sustained (no one-day workshops), but also job-embedded, data-driven, and personalized. It is expected that school districts will need to focus their applications for teacher training to ensure teacher alignment with high quality standards as well as priorities for funds to low-performing schools where comprehensive support and improvement plans are in place. There are also significant funding opportunities for professional development as part of state programs, especially in states where they have consolidated program funding and want solutions that are evidence-based. 
 The professional development services segment, which is relatively fragmented in the United States, is expected to grow as the transition to digital learning in classrooms increases the need for technology 
 
9 
 
 training and implementation support for educators. We believe that the use of interim data, differentiation, teacher content knowledge (in mathematics) and the use of technology in the classroom are the areas in which teachers and leaders are most seeking support. Also, demand for teacher training and professional development opportunities tied to the implementation of new or revised standards at the state level is expected to continue. In addition, there is expected to be a need to develop new teachers as the next several years are expected to continue to see the greening of the teaching force, with approximately 200,000 new teachers entering the work force every year and roughly 50% attrition rate among new teachers. 
 Assessment 
 The assessment segment includes summative, formative or in-classroom, and cognitive assessments. Summative assessments are concluding or final exams that measure students proficiency in a particular subject or group of subjects on an aggregate level or against state standards. Formative assessments are on-going, in-classroom tests that occur throughout the school year and monitor progress in certain subjects or curriculum units. Cognitive assessments are designed to pinpoint areas of need and are often administered by specialists to identify learning difficulties and qualify individuals for special services under the requirements IDEA. 
 Many states and districts are currently utilizing teacher evaluation systems that measure teacher performance based on standardized test scores and other elements required to meet certain benchmarks set by policymakers. Additionally, Federal education policymakers have shifted the focus to children at even younger ages to provide intervention before significant achievement gaps are realized. As a result, this has led to additional opportunities in the early childhood assessment and intervention segments. 
 ESSA requires annual summative testing in reading and mathematics at grades 3 through 8 and one grade level of high school, as well as testing in science at a minimum of three grade levels. Under ESSA, states have greater flexibility than under NCLB in choosing their assessment approach and how they intervene with the lowest performing schools. In addition, the law prohibits federal incentives for states to adopt any particular set of standards, including the Common Core State Standards, and assessments. Several states that had initially participated in the Common Core-based Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) and the Partnership Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) have since dropped out of the consortia and decided to use other assessments to measure student achievement. Major challenges facing the future of the consortia are testing time, cost, and dependency for online assessment delivery. 
 As states plan for and implement new assessments and districts continue to transition to new standards, demand for quality measures and reporting systems that help educators prepare students for the content coverage and item types anticipated on the new assessments should continue to increase. 
 International 
 Internationally, we predominantly export and sell K-12 English language education products to premium private schools that utilize the U.S. curriculum, which are located primarily in Asia, the Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. Our international sales team utilizes a global network of distributors in local markets around the world. 
 Our immediate international strategy is to expand our addressable market through offering private schools in targeted international markets educational solutions comprising print and digital content, professional development services and a wide array of supplemental, intervention and assessment products, which are aimed at improving learning outcomes. 
 Early Learning 
 Over the last decade, the early childhood segment has seen significant growth in enrollments and increases in state and federal funding. These increases are driven by increased awareness of the value of quality pre-K

10 
 
 experiences to educational achievement, its economic benefits, as well as the growth in breadth and depth of state early learning standards. For example, ESSA, while eliminating and consolidating programs in other areas, created a new national program for early childhood education. The Preschool Development Grants program, with authorized annual funding of $250 million, provides grants to support the expansion of quality pre-K programs serving low-income and disadvantaged children. The program builds upon and codifies a similar grant program formerly administered by the U.S. Department of Education. We believe the key to the overall success of pre-K is the quality of the experience, from environments to teachers, with a special focus on instructional materials, an area in which we believe we are well-positioned to grow. 
 Trade Publishing 
 Trade Publishing includes childrens, fiction, nonfiction, culinary and reference titles. While print remains the primary format in which trade books are produced and distributed, demand for trade titles in digital format, primarily e-books, has developed rapidly over the past several years, as the industry evolves to embrace new technologies for developing, producing, marketing and distributing trade works. 
 Our Products and Services 
 We are organized along two reportable segments: Education and Trade Publishing. Our primary segment measures are net sales and Adjusted EBITDA. The Education segment is our largest business, representing approximately 88% of our total net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. 
Education 
 Our Education segment provides educational content, services, and technology solutions to meet the diverse needs of todays classrooms. The principal customers for our Education products are K-12 school systems, which purchase core curriculum materials, intervention and supplemental materials, professional development and school turnaround services, and an array of highly regarded assessment products. Additionally, we believe our increasing portfolio of educational content in the early learning and direct-to-consumer spaces puts us in a strong position for growth in these areas. 
 The Education segment net sales and Adjusted EBITDA were $1,207.1 million and $225.7 million, $1,251.1 million and $269.4 million, and $1,209.1 million and $298.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 Our Education products consist of the following offerings: 
 

 | Comprehensive Curriculum: Our core curriculum offerings include educational programs intended to provide a complete course of study in a subject, either at a single grade level or across multiple grade levels, and serve as the primary source of classroom instruction. We develop and market core curriculum programs for the pre-K-12 market utilizing the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt brands and focusing our content portfolio on the subjects that have consistently received the highest priority from educators and educational policy makers, namely reading, literature and language arts, mathematics, science, world languages and social studies. Within each subject, core learning programs are designed and then marketed with a variety of proprietary products to maximize teaching effectiveness, including digital and print programs, workbooks, teachers guides and resources, audio and visual aids and technology-based products.

professional books and developmental resources aimed at empowering pre-K-12 teachers; our Benchmark Assessment System, which allows teachers to evaluate students reading levels three times a year; and our Leveled Literacy Intervention System, which is a supplementary intervention program for children struggling with reading and writing. The intervention and supplemental materials group generates net sales and earnings that do not vary greatly with the adoption cycle. In addition, the development of intervention and supplemental materials tends to require significantly less capital investment than the development of a core curriculum program. However, as demand for personalized learning solutions is growing, traditional distinctions between core, supplemental and intervention materials and assessments are blurring.

In addition, we are increasingly leveraging the strength of our Trade Publishing brands and characters, such as Curious George, together with our expertise in developing educational solutions, to further penetrate the large and growing consumer market for at-home educational products and services. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Trade Publishing net sales and Adjusted EBITDA were approximately $165.6 million and $6.3 million, $164.9 million and $7.7 million, and $163.2 million and $12.7 million, respectively. 
 Seasonality 
 Approximately 88% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were derived from our Education segment, which is a markedly seasonal business. Schools conduct the majority of their purchases in the second and third quarters of the calendar year in preparation for the beginning of the school year. Thus, over our latest three completed fiscal years, approximately 68% of consolidated net sales were realized in the second and third quarters. Sales of K-12 instructional materials and customized assessment products are also cyclical, with some years offering more sales opportunities than others. The amount of funding available at the state level for educational materials also has a significant effect on year-to-year net sales. Although the loss of a single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our business, schedules of school adoptions and market acceptance of our products can materially affect year-to-year net sales performance. 
 Competition 
 We sell our products in highly competitive markets. In these markets, product quality, innovation and customer service are major differentiating factors between companies. Other factors affecting competition include: (i) competitive pricing, sampling and gratis costs; (ii) digitization and innovative delivery; and (iii) educational effectiveness of the program. In addition to national curriculum publishers, we also compete with a variety of specialized or regional publishers that focus on select disciplines and/or geographic regions in the K-12 market. There are also multiple competitors in the Trade Publishing, supplemental and assessment segments offering content that school districts increasingly are using as part of their core classroom instructional materials. In addition, school districts in many states are able to spend educational funds on instructional materials that include core and supplemental materials, computer software, digital media, digital courseware, and online services. Our larger competitors in the educational market include Pearson Education, Inc., McGraw Hill Education, Cengage Learning, Inc., Scholastic Corporation, K12 Inc., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., The College

Additionally, the trend towards digitalization of content and proliferation of distribution channels and learning management solutions and courseware systems has created additional opportunities for new entrants. 
 Printing and binding; raw materials 
 We outsource the printing and binding of our products, with approximately 55% of our printing requirements handled by one major supplier. We have procurement agreements that provide volume and scheduling flexibility and price predictability. We have a longstanding relationship with these parties. Approximately 20% of our printed materials (consisting primarily of teachers editions and other ancillary components) are printed outside of the United States and approximately 80% of our printed materials (including most student editions) are printed within the United States. Paper is one of our principal raw materials. We purchase our paper primarily through one paper merchant and also directly through suppliers for limited product types. We maintain various agreements that protect against supply availability and unbound price increases. We manage our paper supply concentration by having primary and secondary sources and staying ahead of dramatic market changes. 
 Distribution 
 We operate three distribution facilities from which we coordinate our own distribution process: one each in Indianapolis, Indiana; Geneva, Illinois; and Troy, Missouri. We also utilize select suppliers to assist us with coordinating the distribution process for a limited number of product types. Additionally, some adoption states require us to use in-state textbook depositories for educational materials sold in that particular state. We utilize delivery firms including United Parcel Service Inc., FedEx Freight, CH Robinson Worldwide Inc., YRC Freight, SAIA and USF Holland, Inc. to facilitate the principally ground transportation of products. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 4,500 employees, none of which were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These employees are substantially located in the United States with 243 employees located outside of the United States. We believe that relations with employees are generally good. 
 Intellectual property 
 Our principal intellectual property assets consist of our trademarks and copyrights in our content. Substantially all of our publications are protected by copyright, whether registered or unregistered, either in our name as the author of a work made for hire or the assignee of copyright, or in the name of an author who has licensed us to publish the work. Ownership of such copyrights secures the exclusive right to publish the work in the United States and in many countries abroad for specified periods: in the United States, in most cases, either 95 years from publication or for the authors life plus 70 years, but in any event a minimum of 28 years for works published prior to 1978 and 35 years for works published thereafter. In most cases, the authors who retain ownership of their copyright have licensed to us exclusive rights for the full term of copyright. Under U.S. copyright law, for licenses granted by an author during or after 1978, such exclusive licenses are subject to termination by the author or certain of the authors heirs for a five year period beginning at the end of 35 years after the date of publication of the work or 40 years after the date of the license grant, whichever term ends earlier. 
 We do not own any material patents, franchises or concessions, but we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in connection with our publishing businesses. We believe we have taken, and take in the ordinary course of business, appropriate available legal steps to reasonably protect our intellectual property in all material jurisdictions.

Environmental matters 
 We generally contract with independent printers and binders for their services, and our operations are generally not otherwise affected by environmental laws and regulations. However, as the owner and lessee of real property, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, the remediation of contaminated sites and the handling and disposal of wastes. It is possible that we could face liability, regardless of fault, and can be held jointly or severally liable, if contamination were to be discovered on the properties that we own or lease or on properties that we have formerly owned or leased. We are currently unaware of any material environmental liabilities or other material environmental issues relating to our properties or operations and anticipate no material expenditures for compliance with environmental laws or regulations.
