Company Overview 
We are a leading provider of cloud-based unified communication services (“UCaaS”) and information technology solutions to small and medium sized businesses (“SMB”) and enterprise customers nationwide. We offer a broad suite of cloud-based systems and services under the brand OfficeSuite® to our end-user customers nationwide. Our end-user customers have approximately 182,000 active licenses on our flagship product OfficeSuite® Phone. OfficeSuite® Phone comprises a growing percentage of our overall recurring revenue and the vast majority of our existing cloud-based revenue stream. In addition, we generate revenue from third-party service providers utilizing our technology and OfficeSuite® Phone on a white-label or wholesale basis. These third-party service providers offer services to their own end-user customers located in Canada, certain European countries and the United States with approximately 100,000 currently active licenses. 
 Our product portfolio provides bundled packages that include cloud-based services and network connectivity with a focus on addressing the productivity, mobility, flexibility, security and business continuity needs of end users. In addition, our growth initiatives focus sales channels on communications-intensive multi-location business customers who require multiple products and customers who are likely users of our cloud-based services. These customers generally purchase higher-margin services in multi-year contracts, resulting in higher customer retention rates and higher average monthly recurring revenue. For customers located within the footprint of 252 colocations in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regional markets, we offer additional IP-based and traditional communications services utilizing our network infrastructure. 
We benefit from software development expertise, proprietary technology and a strong next-generation IP network infrastructure. This allows us to offer our customers more than just cloud-based services, but additionally products that include advanced, converged communications services and network access by leveraging our network infrastructure, on a cost-effective basis. 
We have provided cloud-based services in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States since 2005 and offered cloud-based services nationwide since late 2009. We sell through multiple channels including a direct sales force primarily located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, and wholesale and channel partners nationwide. 
As of December 31, 2016, we provided our services to approximately 20,000 business customers nationwide. In 2016, cloud-based services, including both cloud-based computing services and cloud related access, generated 35% of total end-user voice and data revenue, up from 17% in 2012. Revenue for these services has grown at approximately a 14% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) since 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2016 relative to the fourth quarter of 2015, our end-user pure cloud revenue grew 20% and our end-user cloud access revenue grew 5%, resulting in overall end-user cloud revenue growth of 16%. Approximately 40% of our current cloud-based recurring revenue stream is from customers who were previously purchasing other services from us. As the benefits of cloud-based service offerings are more widely adopted by the customers we serve, we anticipate we will convert a growing percentage of our existing customers to our cloud-based service offerings.
We are investing in our cloud-based solutions, specifically by expanding the features and technology of our cloud-based unified communications system and expanding our portfolio of cloud computing services. We provide comprehensive network connectivity to our customers, utilizing our own network and the networks of other carriers through direct interconnections. Integrating cloud-based services and access enable us to offer SMB and enterprise customers unique business solutions on a cost-effective basis.

Professional IT Services
Our professional IT services provide customers with the expertise and tools needed to make the services and technology we offer work for them. We provide our customers with knowledge of current and emerging technologies, and assist them in charting a business plan to leverage those technologies to meet their business goals.
Customers can utilize our certified technicians and engineers on a project basis to help install, deploy and integrate systems. We also provide software tools and online applications that allow customers to, in real time, monitor system performance, create and view reports and make changes to their services. 
Network Access and Other Services
Integrated Services. We offer integrated voice and data packages to small- and medium-sized businesses, including a variety of service options designed to accommodate our customers’ needs. Our integrated offerings result in performance and cost efficiencies, as compared to discrete services purchased from separate competing carriers. We also provide multiple products in a bundle to increase utilization of a common circuit. Services are delivered over a variety of high-bandwidth broadband access methods including high bandwidth Ethernet services, Ethernet-over Copper (“EoC”) and one or more IP-based T-1s. These integrated packages drive increased revenue per customer and higher customer retention.

Industry and Competition
Overview
The communications industry was once defined by voice services, data services (Internet access and networking) and equipment providers. As the role of information technology advances in today’s business environment, the roles of security, mobility, business continuity, software and hardware have become increasingly important for both SMB and enterprise organizations and are increasingly integrated with the communications needs of these entities.
 The cloud-services market has expanded rapidly as high-speed network access has become more readily available and as new technology has allowed enterprise-grade systems (hardware and software) to be deployed inside a service provider’s network for end user availability. Many cloud service providers emerged offering various services that are “hosted” in the cloud. For example, dedicated servers have been collocated inside of provider owned facilities and rented out on a subscription basis. UC services, that combine traditional voice services with advanced services incorporating mobile, presence and chat are now hosted in the cloud and provided as a service and are known as UCaaS.
Technology advancements allowed for servers to be “virtualized” for fractional use by end-users to improve utilization of assets and to make computing resources even more cost-effective for customers whose needs didn’t demand dedicated resources.
Many service providers have adopted a “hosted” and “virtualized” approach to applications and systems to provide services. Private Branch Exchange (“PBX”) phone systems, Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) and Enterprise Resource Management platforms, and other similar systems are now capable of being provided in a hosted cloud environment. These developments have allowed market participants to change their revenue models from typical one-time purchases of software and equipment to monthly or annual subscriptions where access to the equipment, software, technology and features is essentially rented by the customer. Economies of scale have allowed service providers to offer functionality which previously was only cost effective for larger enterprises to a larger base of small- and medium-sized customers.
Today, the market for cloud-based services is expanding rapidly as businesses look for opportunities to improve operational efficiency, accessibility and employee productivity, while reducing risk. As a cloud service provider with the infrastructure, experience and support mechanisms already developed and in place, Broadview offers a portfolio of cloud-based services that address the communications and information technology needs of SMBs and enterprise customers. 
The market for communications services, particularly voice, has been historically dominated by the Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (“ILECs”) in the United States. These carriers include Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”), AT&T, Inc. (“AT&T”), CenturyLink Inc., Frontier Communications Corporation (“Frontier”), FairPoint Communications Inc. (“Fairpoint”), and Windstream Corporation (“Windstream”). While the ILECs own the majority of the local exchange networks providing basic network access in their respective operating regions, competitive communications providers hold significant market share. In recent years, the number of competitive communications providers in the United States has been reduced by industry consolidation and the leading cable companies (“CATVs”) have entered the residential and business communications markets, thereby reducing the market share held by ILECs. 
Historically, we believed that ILECs and CATVs did not adequately focus on SMB customers, which created a sustainable growth opportunity for competitive providers to service SMB customers with a broad array of services, including both traditional access services and cloud-based services. While we believe the opportunity still exists, the ILECs and CATVs are improving their ability to attract and serve our target customers.
Increased complexity in delivering communications and IT services, together with what has been a challenging economic climate has driven business customers to evaluate alternative approaches, including cloud-based products and services. As competitive pressures have commoditized more access services, we believe cloud-based services represent growth opportunities for competitive providers who are successful in tailoring cloud-based services to the needs of customers.
The cloud-based services, including UCaaS, and the access services industries are highly competitive. We believe we compete principally by offering focused customer service, greater ease of use, a powerful portal, accurate billing, a broad set of services and systems, unique technical solutions and competitive pricing. We compete with various different types of service providers, including companies focused solely on cloud-based services as well as ILECs, CATVs, internet service providers, premises-based and hosted Voice Over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) phone system and service providers, competitive local exchange carriers (“CLECs”), wireless companies, interexchange carriers, and other market participants, including vendors, installers and communications management companies.

Our Strengths
Cloud-Based Product Suite. As a Cloud Service Provider, we offer SMB and enterprise customers a variety of cloud-based services that allow organizations to move infrastructure and software 100% into the cloud, for more ubiquitous, secure, ease of use and cost-effective delivery. Services include OfficeSuite® Phone, our cloud-based UCaaS system, OfficeSuite® HD Meeting, our video conferencing and collaboration solution, MyOfficeSuite, our powerful administrative and end-user portal, hosted Microsoft Exchange®, hosted virtual and dedicated servers, data backup and recovery, and archiving, compliance and eDiscovery services, as well as a full complement of cloud-based security services.
Recognized Industry Leader and Innovator. We have received industry recognition for our innovative use of technology, our product development and our customer care. 
Large, Diversified Customer Base. We have approximately 20,000 SMB and enterprise customers who constitute a predictable base of recurring revenue and high quality customer relationships. We believe many of these organizations are target customers to move into the cloud with an experienced provider.
Foundation of Recurring Revenue and Visibility into Revenue and Cash Flows. Our diversified product set and our care for our customers has resulted in favorable quality of revenue trends and improving churn rates that we believe give us good forward visibility into revenue and cash flows. Our deployment of capital is largely success-based, meaning outlay is incurred incrementally only as we add new customers and new recurring revenue.
Customer Service. We closely monitor key operating and customer service performance metrics. Capturing and analyzing this information allows us to improve our internal operating functions, drive profitable revenue growth and quickly respond to changes in demographics, customer behavior and industry trends.
Software Design and Development. We have expertise in software design and development. This expertise extends through to customization and integration of commercially available software products, as well as development and enhancement of our proprietary unified cloud communications products and services. Specifically:
Proprietary Unified Communications Platform. We own the intellectual property and assets of our core 100% cloud-based UCaaS platform OfficeSuite® Phone, including the unified messaging and call center services technologies, and MyOfficeSuite, its companion administrative and end-user portal. As a result, we have direct control of the ongoing development and evolution of the services offered and the technology applied, minimizing license fees and directly controlling feature prioritization, and development schedules. This allows us to deliver unique solutions that are 100% cloud-based to our customers and target markets, including integrations with Salesforce.com®, Skype for Business® and other software and industry applications, differentiating OfficeSuite® from other service provider offerings.
Integrated OSS Infrastructure. We own and develop our internal operations and enterprise management software systems (our OSS), allowing us to continually innovate, develop and deliver automation across our product suite. Further leveraging our in-house software development expertise, we are continuing to evolve self-service tools and additional automation capabilities including integrations of the Salesforce.com® platform into our front-end sales processes. Fully developed in-house, our MyOfficeSuite portal, and its companion desktop and mobile clients, provides a single, adaptable portal for our OfficeSuite® customers to administer, operate and leverage their services from any device. Designed to be user-friendly for users and administrators alike, the MyOfficeSuite family provides full management, instantaneous changes from the online dashboard using customizable widgets and real-time presence, chat and call control.. We have further extended the MyOfficeSuite portal family to include the MyOfficeSuite Agent portal and MyOfficeSuite for white label wholesale customers, providing unprecedented visibility, management and control to our channel partners. 
Facilities-Based Network Infrastructure. We own and operate an IP-based network for the development and delivery of cloud-based services. Our northeastern U.S. network topology incorporates traditional and EoC access technologies, enabling us to cost-effectively provide data services in the Northeast and nationwide utilizing partner carriers.
Experienced Management Team. Our team of senior executives and operating managers has an average of more than 25 years in the industry and expertise integrating acquired assets with existing assets. In connection with our history of mergers and acquisitions, our senior management team has successfully consolidated back-office systems and processes into a single OSS, integrated operations and cultures, and combined products, strategies and sales channels.

Our Markets
We target SMB and enterprise customers nationwide with cloud-based services. Previously, our focus had been solely on markets across 10 states throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States, including the major metropolitan markets of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. While these markets remain important markets for us, our focus has evolved to a nationwide focus. We believe next-generation cloud- and IP-based communications services will continue to gain market share with SMB and enterprise customers. Additionally, we believe cloud-based services allow us to address a greater percentage of an SMB customer’s overall telecom and IT spending budget. As technology and network alternatives have evolved, it has become cost effective to offer our cloud-based communications services and products nationwide. 
Our Revenue and Customers
Our customer base consists of SMB and enterprise customers nationwide, with a historical focus on markets across 10 states throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States. Approximately 88% of our total revenue is generated from our end-users in a wide array of industries including professional services, health care, education, manufacturing, real estate, retail, automotive, non-profit groups and others with less than 1% coming from residential customers. Approximately 12% of total revenue is generated from wholesale, carrier access and other sources. Our wholesale line of business serves other communications providers with voice and data services including cloud-based services, data colocation and other value-added products and services. Similar to our end-user revenue, over 20% of our wholesale revenue stream consists of cloud-based services. The vast majority of revenue is under contract and is of a recurring nature.
We have been a provider of cloud-based communications services to our end-user customers in our Northeast and Mid-Atlantic markets since 2005 and have been providing these services nationwide since late 2009. The following table shows the trend of our cloud-based revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012 through December 31, 2016: 

 | Year Ended December 31,
$ in millions | 2012 | | 2013 | | 2014 | | 2015 | | 2016
End-user cloud-based revenue | $ | 50.6 | | | $ | 57.7 | | | $ | 63.0 | | $ | 72.7 | $ | 84.7
% growth | 20.9 | % | | 14.0 | % | | 9.2 | % | | 15.5 | % | 16.4 | % 

We target larger SMB and enterprise customers, typically generating over $500 in Monthly Recurring Revenue (“MRR”) with direct and channel partner sales teams. These customers generally purchase higher margin cloud-based services in multi-year contracts resulting in higher customer retention rates and profitability. The average MRR across our entire base of business customers has increased from approximately $747 at December 31, 2012 to approximately $1,006 at December 31, 2016. The following table shows the trend in average MRR per business customer as of the last month of each period: 

 | Last Month of Year Ended December 31,
 | 2012 | | 2013 | 2014 | | 2015 | 2016
Average MRR per Business Customer | $ | 747 | | $ | 807 | | $ | 865 | $ | 941 | $ | 1,006

For the month ended December 31, 2016, 90% of our end-user revenue was generated by customers whose MRR is greater than $500, and approximately 78% was generated by customers with MRR of greater than $1,000 per month. The following table shows the five-year trend in the composition of our end-user revenue base in terms of monthly spend as of the last month of each period: 

Trended MRR by Customer Size | Last Month of Year Ended December 31,
 | 2012 | | 2013 | | 2014 | 2015 | | 2016
$0 - $500 | 13 | % | | 12 | % | 12 | % | | 11 | % | 10 | %
>$500 - $1000 | 16 | % | | 15 | % | 14 | % | | 13 | % | 12 | %
>$1,000 | 71 | % | | 73 | % | 74 | % | | 76 | % | 78 | %
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Although we continue to focus on serving larger customers, due to our recent product additions and because we now offer our services nationwide, we are more focused on the UCaaS application portion (cloud-based services) of the potential revenue stream, in preference to the access portion (T-1 and IP voice and data circuits). Access, or last mile connectivity, is the primary 
10

function and focus of the traditional telecommunications providers (ILECs, CLECs, CATVs). Although historically we focused on the access portion, we believe that as a result of technology evolution in our industry, access is increasingly commoditized and there are numerous alternatives for access services at competitive prices. As such, we focus our new sales efforts on the application portion of the revenue stream which we believe provides the greatest “value add” to the customer, often allowing the customer to choose their own method of access from a variety of access providers. This is often referred to as Bring Your Own Broadband or BYOB. Within our network footprint, we continue to also offer access services at competitive prices, providing our customers a choice of which access method works best for them.
As a result of our evolution in focus from access to UCaaS application, our average revenue per new customer and our average revenue per existing business customer is flattening and may decrease over time. In many circumstances, particularly outside of our network footprint, we anticipate being able to generate similar profitability on each new customer, but with lower revenue per customer when we do not provide the access product. 
Customer Service and Retention
We improved our average monthly end-user revenue loss level from 1.7% for the year ended December 31, 2012 to 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016, in part due to our continued shift towards larger customers, our focus on improving customer service and our focus on cloud-based products. The following chart shows the five-year trend for each year for the years ended December 31, 2012 through 2016.

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2012 | | 2013 | | 2014 | 2015 | | 2016
Average Monthly Revenue Loss (1) | 1.7 | % | | 1.7 | % | 1.6 | % | | 1.4 | % | 1.2 | %

(1)     Our calculation of revenue loss is a comprehensive metric and may not be comparable to revenue loss or churn metrics reported by other companies in the industry. Our method is to include all sources of revenue loss including revenue write-down and repricing.
We service customers in a multi-tiered, multi-channel approach. Our inbound contact center, 1-800-BROADVIEW, is staffed 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year both internally and through a third party relationship, who handle all aspects of a customer’s questions, payments, repairs, changes of service, and new service requests. Larger customers are serviced through our dedicated support, project and sales representatives assigned to each customer. 
Customers can choose to utilize our interactive voice response system for automated support, online chat, our OfficeSuite Community, and our award-winning e-Care Enterprise web-based application that provides an array of self-management tools for customers and partners. 

Providing a superior customer experience is a major focus of our customer relationship management team. We collect statistical and direct feedback from customers through direct surveys and other methods regarding their satisfaction, after recent service experience and after disconnect, and use the information to refine and improve our processes as well as to measure the effectiveness of the organization. 
Our Network
Our network architecture leverages multiple data centers and hundreds of collocations connected by IP and MPLS technologies from Juniper Networks and Cisco Systems, VoIP softswitches from MetaSwitch, including call agents and gateways, Ethernet over Copper and other broadband access, to deliver cloud-based unified communications and computing services to our customers. We reach our customers through the customer's own Internet access or by providing access on our own network or leveraging last mile connections through numerous carrier agreements. Our core network operates with 99.999% of availability and our Network Operations Center (“NOC”) monitors our network 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year.
11

Data Centers
We operate two data centers located within our central offices, which we utilize primarily for providing space, power and services for hosting customer-owned equipment as well as for hosting our OSS and servers. In addition, we provide our cloud computing services through cloud services partners, leveraging multiple data centers in diverse geographic locations nationwide.
Fiber Network and Fiber Equipment
We operate a multi-state fiber network consisting of local metropolitan fiber rings and interstate long haul fiber systems. The fiber network consists of our owned fiber, dark fiber, Indefeasible Right of Use (“IRU”), and light-wave IRU from multiple providers. We have approximately 3,000 fiber route miles consisting of both our owned fiber and dark fiber, primarily pursuant to IRUs.
Service Agreements with Carriers
We obtain last mile access services from Verizon through state-specific interconnection agreements, commercial agreements, local wholesale tariffs and interstate contract tariffs. We also maintain agreements with a number of other carriers for the provision of network facilities, including fiber routes and high capacity loops and transport, internet service providers, and local voice and data services. These agreements often provide cost-effective alternatives for last mile connections to customers. 
Integrated Operational Support Systems (“OSS”)
We have developed and continue to improve and update our integrated sales automation, order processing, service provisioning, billing, payment, collection, customer service, network surveillance, testing, repair and information systems that enable us to offer and deliver high-quality, easy-to-use, competitively priced communications services to our customers. Our software platform and business process is designed to maximize resource efficiency by ensuring single entry and flow-through of all data elements needed to provision and bill for services, from the initial sales proposal through the final order, as well as by providing self-service through online portals to customers and agents.
Sales, Order Entry and Provisioning Systems
Our sales automation, order entry and provisioning systems enable us to collect, leverage, distribute and manage sales leads, shorten the customer provisioning time cycle and reduce associated costs. The sales management toolset begins with iLead, a unified web-based customer relationship management portal built on the Salesforce.com® platform, which offers an extensive array of sales tools and capabilities. These include lead and funnel management, sales forecasting, hierarchical dashboards and reports, and full automation from proposal generation to e-signature to sales close, along with subsequent automated workflow through to design, provisioning and project management, leading to service turn-up and billing.
To support our channel partners, we created PartnerConnect, a purpose built variant of iLead. Through our iLead and PartnerConnect portals, our sales team, and channel partners can track order status, trouble reports and commissions in real-time
Customer Relationship Management System
Our CRM solutions include e-Care Enterprise and OpenCafe. e-Care Enterprise, a recipient of multiple awards for customer service and applications of business technology, allows our customers to directly monitor and manage their accounts and services online. OpenCafe, our internal CRM application, provides our customer service representatives with real time access to all information pertinent to the customer, in an organized and easy to use front-end system. In addition, OpenCafe is directly integrated with our trouble ticketing and repair tracking systems, allowing instant access to repair status and reporting. We continue to develop and implement improvements to e-Care Enterprise and OpenCafe, delivering more capabilities to our customer service representatives and customers. These CRM platforms are integrated with our MyOfficeSuite portal, which provides our customers with a high level of visibility, management and control of their OfficeSuite and related services through an intuitive user interface.
Our in-house developed billing system enables us to run multiple bill cycles with full color for the many different, tailored service packages, increasing customer satisfaction while minimizing revenue leakage and providing billing information on-line via various portals, including e-Care Enterprise and MyOfficeSuite. Our automated collections management system, integrated with our billing system, allows us to increase the efficiency of the collections process, which accelerates the collection of accounts receivable.
12

Network Management Systems
Our network management systems include core licensed applications, such as TEOCO Corporation’s Netrac. With these core licensed applications, our in-house software developers have, through APIs, developed overarching control and management software applications to leverage these systems on an automated basis, and coupled the functionality to our business support applications to deliver seamless service, provisioning and billing. In addition, we have leveraged these applications to deliver Web-D, our work force management, project scheduling, assigning and tracking application, maximizing the efficiency of our field workforce. 
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements, third party non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. No individual patent, trademark or copyright is material to our business. We own a collection of patents registered in the United States, Canada and other countries relating to network design and technology for the delivery of enhanced voice services, as well as a process patent relating to our network hot-cut process. We have granted security interests in our trademarks, copyrights and patents to our lenders pursuant to the Company's $25.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and the indenture governing the $150.0 million of 10.5% Senior Secured Notes due November, 2017 (the “Notes”).
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 745 employees, including approximately 115 quota-bearing representatives across all sales channels. In addition, we had approximately 165 associates at December 31, 2016 working on our behalf, but employed by service partners of the Company. Our employees are not members of any labor unions. We believe that relations with our employees are good. We have not experienced any work stoppage due to labor disputes.

REGULATION
Overview
We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, and orders affecting the rates, terms, and conditions of certain of our service offerings, our costs, and other aspects of our operations, including our relations with other service providers. Regulation varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and may change in response to judicial proceedings, legislative and administrative proposals, government policies, competition, and technological developments. 
The Federal Communication Commission (the “FCC”) has jurisdiction over our facilities and services to the extent they are used in the provision of interstate or international communications services. State regulatory public utility commissions generally have jurisdiction over facilities and services to the extent they are used in the provision of intrastate services. Local governments may regulate aspects of our business through zoning requirements, permit or right-of-way procedures, and franchise fees. Foreign laws and regulations apply to communications that originate or terminate in a foreign country. Generally, the FCC and state public utility commissions either do not or minimally regulate Internet, video conferencing, or certain data services, although the underlying communications components of such offerings are generally regulated. Our operations also are subject to various environmental, building, safety, health, and other governmental laws and regulations.
Federal law generally preempts state statutes and regulations that restrict the provision of competitive local, long distance and enhanced services. Because of this preemption, we are generally free to provide the full range of local, long distance and data services in every state. While this federal preemption increases our potential for growth, it also increases the amount of competition to which we may be subject. 
Federal Regulation
The Communications Act of 1934 (the “Communications Act”) grants the FCC authority to regulate interstate and foreign communications by wire or radio. The FCC imposes extensive regulations on common carriers that have some degree of market power such as ILECs. The FCC imposes less regulation on common carriers without market power, such as us. The FCC permits these non-dominant carriers to provide domestic interstate services (including long distance and access services) without prior authorization; but it requires carriers to receive authorization to construct and operate telecommunications facilities and to provide or resell communications services, between the United States and international points. Further, we remain subject to numerous requirements of the Communications Act, including certain provisions of Title II applicable to all common carriers which require us to offer service upon reasonable request and pursuant to just and reasonable charges and terms, and which prohibit any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges or terms. The FCC has authority to impose additional requirements on non-dominant carriers.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the “Telecommunications Act”) amended the Communications Act to eliminate many barriers to competition in the U.S. communications industry. Under the Telecommunications Act, any entity, including cable television (“CATV”) companies and electric and gas utilities, may enter any communications market, subject to reasonable state certification requirements and regulation of safety, quality and consumer protection. The Telecommunications Act was intended to increase competition. Among other things, the Telecommunications Act opened the local exchange services market by requiring ILECs to permit competitive carriers to interconnect to their networks at any technically feasible point and required them to utilize certain parts of their networks at FCC-regulated (generally cost based) rates; it also established requirements applicable to all local exchange carriers, including competitive local exchange carriers (“CLEC”). Examples include:
•Reciprocal Compensation.  Required all ILECs and CLECs to complete calls originated by competing carriers under reciprocal arrangements at prices based on a reasonable approximation of incremental cost or through mutual exchange of traffic without explicit payment.
•Resale.  Required all ILECs and CLECs to permit resale of their communications services without unreasonable or discriminatory restrictions or conditions. In addition, ILECs were required to offer for resale, wholesale versions of all communications services that the ILEC provides at retail to subscribers that are not telecommunications carriers at discounted rates, based on the costs avoided by the ILEC in the wholesale offering.
14

•Access to Rights-of-Way.  Required all ILECs and CLECs and any other public utility that owns or controls poles, conduits, ducts, or rights-of-way used in whole or in part for wire communications, to permit competing carriers (and CATV systems) access to those poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way at regulated prices. CLEC rates for access to its poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way, however, are not regulated.
The Telecommunications Act also codified the ILECs’ equal access and nondiscrimination obligations and preempted inconsistent state regulation.
Legislation.  Congress is considering rewriting the Telecommunications Act. The prospects and timing of the potential legislative initiative remain unclear, and as such, we cannot predict the outcome of any such legislative effort.
Unbundled Network Elements.  The Telecommunications Act required ILECs to provide requesting telecommunications carriers with nondiscriminatory access to network elements on an unbundled basis at any technically feasible point on rates, terms and conditions that are just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory, in accordance with the other requirements set forth in Sections 251 and 252 of the Communications Act. The Telecommunications Act gave the FCC authority to determine which network elements must be made available to requesting carriers such as us. The FCC was required to determine whether the failure to provide access to such network elements would impair the ability of the carrier seeking access to provide the services it sought to offer. Based on this standard, the FCC developed an initial list of Regional Bell Operating Company (“RBOC”) network elements that must be unbundled on a national basis in 1996. Those initial rules were set aside by the U.S. Supreme Court and the FCC subsequently developed revised unbundling rules, which also were set aside on appeal.
In August 2003, in the Triennial Review Order (“TRO”), the FCC substantially modified its rules governing access to unbundled network elements (“UNEs”). The FCC limited requesting carrier access to certain aspects of the loop, transport, switching and signaling/databases UNEs but continued to require some unbundling of these elements. In the TRO, the FCC also determined that certain broadband elements, including “fiber-to-the-home loops” in “greenfield” situations, broadband services over fiber-to-the-home loops in overbuild situations, packet switching, and the packetized portion of hybrid loops, were not subject to unbundling obligations. On March 2, 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated certain portions of the TRO and remanded to the FCC for further proceedings.
In December 2004, the FCC issued an Order on Remand of the TRO (“TRRO”), which became effective on March 11, 2005. The TRRO further modified the unbundling obligations of ILECs. Under certain circumstances, the FCC removed the ILECs’ unbundling obligations with regard to high capacity local loops and dedicated transport and eliminated the obligation to provide local switching. Under the FCC’s new rules, the availability of high capacity loops and transport depends upon new tests based on the capacity of the facility, the business line density of incumbent wire centers, and the existence of colocated fiber providers in incumbent wire centers. 
FCC rules implementing the local competition provisions of the Telecommunications Act permitted CLECs to lease UNEs at rates determined by state public utility commissions employing the FCC’s Total Element Long Run Incremental Cost forward-looking, cost-based pricing model. On September 15, 2003, the FCC opened a proceeding reexamining the Total Element Long Run Incremental Cost (“TELRIC”) methodology and wholesale pricing rules for communications services made available for resale by ILECs in accordance with the Telecommunications Act. This proceeding was intended to determine whether the TELRIC pricing model produced unpredictable pricing inconsistent with appropriate economic signals; failed to adequately reflect the real-world attributes of the routing and topography of an ILEC’s network; and created disincentives to investment in facilities by understating forward-looking costs in pricing RBOC network facilities and overstating efficiency assumptions. 
In orders released in August 2004, the FCC extended the unbundling relief it had previously provided to fiber-to-the-home loops to “fiber-to-the-curb loops.” On October 27, 2004, the FCC issued an order granting requests by the Regional Bell Operating Companies (“RBOCs”) that the FCC forbear from enforcing the independent unbundling requirements of Section 271 of the Communications Act with regard to the broadband elements that the FCC had previously determined were not subject to unbundling obligations (fiber-to-the-home loops, fiber-to-the-curb loops, the packetized functionality of hybrid loops, and packet switching). 
On September 16, 2005, the FCC partially granted a petition filed by Qwest Communications International, Inc. (“Qwest”) seeking forbearance from the application of the FCC’s dominant carrier regulation of interstate services, and Section 251(c) requirements throughout the Omaha, Nebraska Metropolitan Statistical Area (“MSA”). The FCC granted Qwest the requested relief in nine of its 24 Omaha central offices where it determined that competition from intermodal (cable) service providers was “extensive.” Although the FCC required that Qwest continue to make UNEs available in the nine specified central offices, Qwest was only required to do so at non-Total Element Long Run Incremental Cost rates. The FCC did not grant Qwest the requested relief regarding its colocation and interconnection obligations. On January 30, 2007, the FCC partially granted ACS of Anchorage, Inc.’s (“ACS”) petition seeking forbearance from the application of the FCC’s dominant carrier regulation of interstate services, 
15

and Section 251(c) requirements throughout the Anchorage, Alaska local exchange carrier study area. The FCC granted ACS the requested relief in five of its 11 Anchorage central offices where it determined that “competition by the local cable operator . . . ensures that market forces will protect the interests of consumers.” Although the FCC required that ACS continue to make UNEs available in the five central offices in which the requested relief was granted, it was only required to do so at commercially negotiated rates. 
In December 2007, the FCC denied a Verizon petition for relief comparable to that accorded Qwest and ACS - forbearance from the application of the FCC’s dominant carrier regulation of interstate services, and Section 251(c) unbundling requirements - in six MSAs, including the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-PA MSA, the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington-Baltimore PA-NJ-DE-MD MSA and the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy, MA-NH MSA. On June 19, 2009, the D.C. Circuit remanded the Verizon forbearance decision to the FCC for further consideration and explanation. On August 20, 2009, the FCC initiated a proceeding to address the remand of the Verizon forbearance decision, as well as the remand of another order denying Qwest UNE-forbearance relief in four of its largest markets. Both Verizon and Qwest withdrew their UNE-forbearance petitions following denial by the FCC of Qwest’s Phoenix UNE-forbearance request. In denying the Qwest Phoenix UNE-forbearance petition, the FCC established a new market-power analytical framework for assessing future forbearance petitions. 
On September 23, 2005, the FCC issued an order that largely deregulates “wireline broadband Internet access service.” The FCC refers to “wireline broadband Internet access service” as a service that uses existing or future wireline facilities of the telephone network to provide subscribers with access to the Internet, including by means of both next generation fiber-to-the-premises services and all digital subscriber lines. This decision by the FCC follows the decision by the United States Supreme Court in the “Brand X Case”, issued June 27, 2005, in which the Court held that cable systems are not legally required to lease access to competing providers of Internet access service. Consistent with the FCC’s previous classification of cable modem service as an information service, the FCC classified broadband Internet access service as an information service because it intertwines transmission service with information processing and is not, therefore, a “pure” transmission service such as frame relay or ATM, which remained classified as telecommunications services. The FCC required that existing transmission arrangements between broadband Internet access service providers and their customers be made available for a one-year period from the effective date of this decision. This decision did not affect CLECs’ ability to obtain UNEs, but did relieve the ILECs of any duty to offer DSL transmission services subject to regulatory oversight.
On March 19, 2006, the FCC, by inaction, granted Verizon’s Petition for Forbearance from the application of the FCC’s Computer II and Title II requirements to Verizon’s Broadband service offerings. Arguably, the grant of Verizon’s petition permitted Verizon to offer DSL, ATM, Frame Relay and T-1 services on a non-common carrier basis, free from unbundling and Total Element Long Run Incremental Cost pricing requirements, although Verizon appeared to narrow its petition to ask for far more limited relief, limiting the requested relief to a select group of service offerings. Other ILECs have sought and been granted similar relief. On October 12, 2007, the FCC agreed that AT&T’s existing packet-switched broadband telecommunications services and existing optical transmission services could be treated as non-dominant and would no longer be subject to certain regulatory requirements. Other ILECs have sought and been granted similar relief.
In June 2009, the FCC adopted new rules governing forbearance requests. These rules require, among other things, that forbearance petitions be complete when filed, state explicitly the scope of the relief requested, identify any other relevant proceedings and comply with certain format requirements. The rules also limit the petitioner’s right to withdraw the petition or narrow its scope. 
In December 2015, the FCC granted in substantial part a forbearance petition filed by the U.S. Telecom Association on October 6, 2014. The FCC elected to forebear from, among other things, (i) further application to the RBOCs of Sections 271 and 272 of the Telecommunications Act and (ii) the requirement that ILECs provide a 64 kbps voice channel where copper loops have been retired. Other petitions pending before the FCC seek to reverse forbearance authority previously granted to the ILECs.
In August 2015, the FCC released a Report and Order which formally addressed the transition from networks based on Time-Division Multiplexing (“TDM”) circuit-switched voice services running on copper loops to all- Internet Protocol (“IP”) multi-media networks using copper, coaxial cable, wireless and fiber as physical infrastructure. In its Report and Order, the FCC identified the principals which should guide this transition which include competition, consumer protection, universal service, public safety and national security. The FCC concluded that while transitioning from TDM to IP, it was critical to preserve competition by maintaining wholesale access to network facilities for competitive providers. While the FCC did not impose any new wholesale access obligations on ILECs during the transition, it did strengthen its copper retirement and service discontinuation rules so that wholesale network access would remain viable.
In its 2015 “Open Internet Order,” the FCC reclassified broadband Internet access as a common-carrier service. In so doing, the FCC subjected broadband Internet access to Title II regulation under the Communications Act, although it did not apply certain Title II requirements. The FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order was upheld on appeal in June 2016.
16

Special Access.  Over the past decade, the FCC has undertaken a lengthy and comprehensive review of its rules governing the pricing of special access service offered by ILECs subject to price cap regulation. Special access pricing by these carriers currently is subject to price cap rules, as well as pricing flexibility rules that permit these carriers to offer volume and term discounts and contract tariffs (“Phase I pricing flexibility”) and/or remove from price caps regulation special access service in a defined geographic area (“Phase II pricing flexibility”) based on showings of competition. In a Tariff Investigating Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, issued on April 28, 2016 the FCC tentatively concluded that it would continue to permit pricing flexibility where competitive market forces would be sufficient to constrain special access prices, but undertook an examination of whether the current triggers for pricing flexibility had accurately gauged competition levels and worked as intended. The FCC has also requested comments on, amoung other things, whether certain aspects of ILEC special access tariff offerings (e.g., basing discounts on previous volumes of service; tying nonrecurring charges and termination penalties to term commitments; and imposing use restrictions in connection with discounts) are unreasonable. While the FCC would have adopted many of the pro-competitive changes proposed in its NPRM in a proposed Report in Order circulated before the November presidential election, the recent change in administrations has rendered such an outcome highly unlikely.
Interconnection Agreements.  Pursuant to FCC rules implementing the Telecommunications Act, we negotiate interconnection agreements with ILECs to obtain access to UNE services, generally on a state-by-state basis. These agreements typically have three-year terms. We currently have interconnection agreements in effect with Verizon for, among other states, New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware and Rhode Island, as well as the District of Columbia. In the states of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, we have interconnection agreements with FairPoint following its acquisition of Verizon’s network assets in these states. We have entered into a multi-state interconnection agreement with AT&T covering its entire ILEC service area and are currently negotiating agreements with other ILECs to support our nationwide service offering outside the Verizon Northeast and Mid-Atlantic service areas. 
We are in the process of renegotiating our interconnection agreement with Verizon in New York. If the negotiation process does not produce, in a timely manner, an interconnection agreement that we find acceptable, we may petition the New York public utility commission to arbitrate any disputed issues. Arbitration decisions in turn may be appealed to federal courts. As an alternative to negotiating an interconnection agreement, we may adopt, in its entirety, another carrier’s approved agreement.
Colocation.  FCC rules generally require ILECs to permit competitors to colocate equipment used for interconnection and/or access to UNEs. Changes to those rules, upheld in 2002 by the D.C. Circuit, allow competitors to colocate multifunctional equipment and require ILECs to provision cross-connects between colocated carriers. 
Regulation of ISPs.  To date, the FCC has treated Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) as enhanced service providers, which are generally exempt from federal and state regulations governing common carriers. Nevertheless, in its recently released “Open Internet Order,” the FCC recently reclassified broadband Internet access as a common-carrier service and subjected broadband Internet access providers to a number of the core consumer protection requirements of Title II of the Communications Act.
Moreover, Congress has passed a number of laws that concern the Internet and Internet users. Generally, these laws limit the application of taxes to and the potential liability of ISPs. 
Network Management and Internet Neutrality. In August 2005, the FCC adopted a policy statement that outlined four principles intended to preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the Internet. The FCC, the Obama Administration and Congress have expressed interest in imposing these so-called “net neutrality” requirements on broadband Internet access providers, which address whether, and the extent to which, owners of network infrastructure should be permitted to engage in network management practices that prioritize data packets on their networks through commercial arrangements or based on other preferences. In its 2005 policy statement the RFCC expressed the view that consumers are entitled to access lawful Internet content and to run applications and use services of their choice, subject to the needs of law enforcement and reasonable network management. In an August 2008 decision, the FCC characterized these net neutrality principles as binding and enforceable and stated that network operators have the burden to prove that their network management techniques are reasonable. In that order, which was overturned by a court decision in April 2010, the FCC imposed sanctions on a broadband Internet access provider for managing its network by blocking or degrading some Internet transmissions and applications in a way that the FCC found to be unreasonably discriminatory. In December 2010, the FCC issued new rules to govern network management practices and prohibit unreasonable discrimination in the transmission of Internet traffic. The FCC’s decision adopting these rules was vacated and remanded to the agency for further consideration
. 
17

On February 26, 2015, the FCC released its “Open Internet Order,” adopting new net neutrality rules for broadband providers. In addition to reclassifying broadband internet access as a common carrier service subject to Title II of the Communication Act, the order adopts three main prohibitions: (i) no “blocking,” (ii) no “throttling” and (iii) no “paid prioritization.” As a standard of conduct, the FCC ruled that providers may not unreasonably interfere with or unreasonably disadvantage (i) end users’ ability to select, access and use broadband Internet access service or the lawful Internet content, applications, services or devices of their choice, or (ii) edge providers’ ability to make lawful content, applications, services or devices available to end users. The FCC also adopted enhanced transparency rules which apply, among other things, to price, performance characteristics and network practices. Finally, the FCC declined to forbear from application of Title II’s core consumer safeguards, but did forbear from unbundling and network access requirements such as those impose by Title II on ILECs. The FCC’s “Open Internet” rules were upheld on appeal, but are likely to be rolled back by the new Trump administration.
Long Distance Competition.  Section 271 of the Communications Act, enacted as part of the Telecommunications Act, established a process by which an RBOC could obtain authority to provide long distance service in a state within its region. Each RBOC was required to demonstrate that it had satisfied a “14-point competitive checklist” and that granting such authority would be in the public interest. All of the RBOCs have received FCC approval to provide in-state long distance service within their respective regions. Receipt of Section 271 authority by the RBOCs has resulted in increased competition in certain markets and services.
The RBOCs have a continuing obligation to comply with the 14-point competitive checklist, and are subject to continuing oversight by the FCC and state public utility commissions. Each RBOC must provide unbundled access to UNEs at just and reasonable rates and comply with state-specific Performance Assurance Plans pursuant to which a RBOC that fails to provide access to its facilities in a timely and commercially sufficient manner must provide affected CLECs compensation in the form of cash or service credits. 
On November 8, 2013, the FCC released its “Rural Call Completion Order” which adopted new rules designed to strengthen its ability to ensure the provision of a reasonable and nondiscriminatory level of service to rural areas. To this end, the FCC adopted rules that require, among other things, certain originating long-distance providers to record, retain and report information on long distance call completion. The data so gathered is intended to allow the FCC to monitor service so as to ensure that the percentage delivery and service quality of calls to rural areas is comparable to the percentage delivery and service quality of calls to non-rural areas. The FCC has entered into a number of consent decrees and imposed substantial finds on large interexchange carriers (“IXCs”) whose rural call completion results failed to pass muster. 
Detariffing.  The FCC has largely eliminated carriers’ obligations to file with the FCC tariffs containing prices, terms and conditions of service and has required carriers to withdraw all of their federal tariffs other than those relating to access services. Our interstate and international rates nonetheless must still be just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory. Our state tariffs generally remain in place, although an increasing number of states are following the FCC’s lead and eliminating tariffs. Detariffing precludes our ability to rely on filed rates, terms and conditions as a means of providing notice to customers of prices, terms and conditions under which we offer services, and requires us instead to rely on individually negotiated agreements with end-users. We have, however, historically relied primarily on our sales force and marketing activities to provide information to our customers regarding the rates, terms, and conditions of service and expect to continue to do so. Further, in accordance with the FCC’s orders we maintain a schedule of our rates, terms and conditions for our interstate and international services on our web site. 
Intercarrier Compensation.  The FCC’s intercarrier compensation rules include rules governing access charges, which govern the payments that IXCs and wireless service providers make to local exchange carriers (“LECs”) to originate and terminate long distance calls, and reciprocal compensation rules, which generally govern the compensation between telecommunications carriers for the transport and termination of local traffic. On March 3, 2005, the FCC released a further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on a variety of proposals to replace the current system of intercarrier payments, under which the compensation rate depends on the type of traffic at issue, the type of carriers involved, and the end points of the communication, with a unified approach for access charges and reciprocal compensation. In connection with the FCC’s rulemaking proceeding, a number of industry groups attempted to negotiate a plan that would bring all intercarrier compensation and access charges to a unified rate over a negotiated transition period. The FCC called for public comment on one such plan designated the “Missoula Plan.” In November 2008, the FCC issued a further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking setting forth various proposals for the reform of its intercarrier compensation regime. In its “National Broadband Plan,” released on March 16, 2010, the FCC recommended that per-minute intercarrier compensation charges be eliminated over time: first, by moving intrastate switched access charges to interstate levels over a period of two to four years; second, by moving switched access charge rates to reciprocal compensation levels; and third, by phasing out per-minute intercarrier compensation rates altogether.
18

In November 2011, the FCC adopted policy changes that will over time ultimately reduce carriers’ access rates applicable for all telecommunications traffic exchanged with an LEC to a uniform “bill-and-keep” framework for both intrastate and interstate access traffic. The reforms required by the FCC’s new rules are being phased in over a multi-year transition. Specifically, effective December 29, 2011, the following rates were capped: (1) all interstate access rate elements and reciprocal compensation rates; (2) for price cap carriers and CLECs operating in their areas, all intrastate access rates; and (3) for rate-of-return carriers and CLECs operating in their areas, terminating access rates only. In addition, competitive carriers were required to reduce their intrastate tariffed access charges by July 2013 to those no greater than the incumbent carriers with which they compete, as was currently required with CLEC’s interstate access charges. From 2015 through 2018, further reductions in both intrastate and interstate access charges and reciprocal compensation rates are required, with a “bill-and-keep” framework ultimately applicable for all charges. These new rules significantly alter the manner in which all carriers, including carriers such as us that use different service platforms such as wireless and VoIP, are compensated for the origination and termination of telecommunications traffic and the rates that we pay for these services. The FCC new intercarrier compensation regime was upheld on appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. While in their current form, these new rules will result in a loss of revenues for carriers such as us, the FCC has authorized carriers such as us to recover lost revenue attributable to the FCC action through price increases and charges to the end user customer.
On April 18, 2001, the FCC issued a new order regarding intercarrier compensation for ISP-bound traffic. In that Order, the FCC established a new intercarrier compensation mechanism for ISP-bound traffic with declining rates over a three-year period. In addition to establishing a new rate structure, the FCC capped the amount of ISP-bound traffic that would be “compensable” and prohibited payment of intercarrier compensation for ISP-bound traffic to carriers entering new markets. The April 2001 order was appealed to the D.C. Circuit, which ultimately found that the FCC had not provided an adequate legal basis for its ruling, and therefore remanded the matter to the FCC. In the interim, the court let the FCC’s rules stand. In November 2008, the FCC issued revised rules governing the intercarrier compensation regime that would govern ISP-bound traffic. These rules have been upheld on appeal. On October 8, 2004, the FCC issued an order in response to a July 2003 Petition for Forbearance filed by Core Communications (the “Core Petition”) asking the FCC to forbear from enforcing the rate caps, growth cap, and new market and mirroring rules of the remanded April 2001 order. The FCC granted the Core Petition with respect to the growth cap and the new market rules, but denied the Core Petition as to the rate caps and mirroring rules.
CALEA.  The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (“CALEA”) requires communications providers to provide law enforcement officials with call content and/or call identifying information under a valid electronic surveillance warrant, and to reserve a sufficient number of circuits for use by law enforcement officials in executing court-authorized electronic surveillance. 
CPNI.  FCC rules protect the privacy of certain information about customers that communications carriers, including us, acquire in the course of providing communications services. CPNI includes information related to the quantity, technological configuration, type, destination and the amount of use of a communications service. The FCC’s initial CPNI rules prevented a carrier from using CPNI to market certain services without the express approval of the affected customer, referred to as an “opt-in” approach. In July 2002, the FCC revised its opt-in rules in a manner that limits our ability to use the CPNI of our subscribers without first engaging in extensive customer service processes and recordkeeping. Recently, the FCC further modified its CPNI requirements to, among other things, extend CPNI regulations to interconnected VoIP providers, require annual carrier certifications and to impose additional limitations on the release of CPNI without express customer approval. Congress has recently overturned the FCC action extending privacy rules to interconnected VoIP providers.
Universal Service.  Section 254 of the Communications Act and the FCC’s implementing rules require all communications carriers providing interstate or international communications services to periodically contribute to the Universal Service Fund (“USF”). The USF supports several programs administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company (“USAC”) with oversight from the FCC, including: (i) communications and information services for schools and libraries, (ii) communications and information services for rural health care providers, (iii) basic telephone service in regions characterized by high communications costs, (iv) basic telephone services for low-income consumers, and (v) interstate access support. Based on the total funding needs for these programs, the FCC determines a contribution factor, which it applies to each contributor’s interstate and international end-user communications revenues. We measure and report our revenues in accordance with rules adopted by the FCC. The contribution rate factors are calculated and revised quarterly and we are billed for our contribution requirements each month based on projected interstate and international end-user communications revenues, subject to periodic true-up. USF contributions may be passed through to consumers on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis either as a component of the rate charged for communications services or as a separately invoiced line item.
In its “National Broadband Plan,” the FCC offered a series of ambitious proposals to transform the then current universal voice service mandate into one directly supporting universal access to broadband services, phasing out support for voice-only telephone services and replacing it with support for voice-enabled broadband platforms. In November 2011, the FCC expanded the USF to include broadband services as part of the Connect America Fund (“CAF”). The new fund also includes a “Mobility Fund,” making mobile broadband an independent universal service objective.

Telephone Numbering.  The FCC oversees the administration and the assignment of local telephone numbers, an important asset to voice carriers, by NeuStar, Inc., in its capacity as North American Numbering Plan Administrator (“NANC”). Extensive FCC regulations govern telephone numbering, area code designation, and dialing procedures. Since 1996, the FCC has permitted businesses and residential customers to retain their telephone numbers when changing local telephone companies, referred to as local number portability. The availability of number portability is important to competitive carriers like us, because customers, especially businesses, may be less likely to switch to a competitive carrier if they cannot retain their existing telephone numbers. 
On May 14, 2009, the FCC issued an order that requires carriers to complete simple wireline and simple intermodal number ports within one business day. The order requires the North American Numbering Council (“NANC”) to develop new process flows that take into account the shortened porting interval. 
Slamming.  A customer’s choice of local or long distance communications company is encoded in the customer’s record, which is used to route the customer’s calls so that the customer is served and billed by the desired company. A customer may change service providers at any time, but the FCC and some states regulate this process and require that specific procedures be followed. Slamming occurs when these specific procedures are not followed, such as when a customer’s service provider is changed without proper authorization or as a result of fraud. The FCC has levied substantial fines for slamming. 
Taxes and Regulatory Fees.  We are subject to numerous local, state and federal taxes and regulatory fees, including but not limited to a three percent federal excise tax on local service, FCC regulatory fees and public utility commission regulatory fees. We have procedures in place to ensure that we properly collect taxes and fees from our customers and remit such taxes and fees to the appropriate entity pursuant to applicable law and/or regulation. 
The Internet Tax Freedom Act placed a moratorium on taxes on Internet access and multiple, discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. Certain states have enacted various taxes on Internet access and electronic commerce, and selected states’ taxes are being contested on a variety of bases. 
State Regulation
The Communications Act maintains the authority of individual states to impose their own regulation of rates, terms and conditions of intrastate services, so long as such regulation is not inconsistent with the requirements of federal law or has not been preempted. Because we provide communications services that originate and terminate within individual states, including both local service and in-state long distance toll service, we are subject to the jurisdiction of the public utility commission and other regulators in each state in which we provide such services. For instance, we must obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (“CPCN”) or similar authorization before we may commence the provision of communications services in a state. We are certified to provide facilities-based and resold competitive local and interexchange service throughout the contiguous United States the State of Hawaii and the District of Columbia.
In addition to requiring certification, state regulatory authorities often impose tariff and filing requirements and obligations to contribute to state universal service and other funds. State public utility commissions also regulate, to varying degrees, the rates, terms and conditions upon which we and our competitors conduct retail business. In general, state regulation of ILEC retail offerings is greater than the level of regulation applicable to CLECs. In a number of states, however, ILECs either have obtained or continue to actively seek some level of increased pricing flexibility or deregulation, either through amendment of state law or through proceedings before state public utility commissions. 
We also are subject to state laws and regulations regarding slamming, cramming, and other consumer protection and disclosure regulations. States further retain the right to sanction a service provider or to revoke certification if the service provider violates relevant laws or regulations. Finally, we may be subject to requirements in some states to obtain prior approval for, or notify the state commission of, any transfers of control, sales of assets, corporate reorganizations, issuance of stock or debt instruments and related transactions.
Rates for intrastate switched access services, which we provide to IXCs to originate and terminate in-state toll calls, are subject to the jurisdiction of the state in which the call originated and/or terminated. State public utility commissions also regulate the rates ILECs charge for interconnection, access to network elements, and resale of services by competitors. 
State regulators establish and enforce wholesale service quality standards that RBOCs must meet in providing network elements to CLECs like us. These plans sometimes require payments from the ILECs to the CLECs if quality standards are not met. ILECs are actively petitioning various state commissions to modify the state wholesale quality plans in ways that would reduce or eliminate certain wholesale quality standards.

Local Regulation
Local governments may regulate aspects of our business through zoning requirements, permit or right-of-way procedures, and franchise fees. In some municipalities where we have installed facilities, we may be required to pay license or franchise fees based on a percentage of our revenues generated from within the municipal boundaries. 
Regulation of VoIP
Federal and State
The use of the public Internet and private Internet protocol networks to provide voice communications services, including VoIP, has been largely unregulated within the United States. To date, the FCC has not imposed regulatory surcharges or most forms of traditional common carrier regulation upon providers of Internet communications services, although it has ruled that VoIP providers must contribute to the USF. The FCC has also imposed obligations on providers of two-way interconnected VoIP services to provide E911 service, and it has extended CALEA obligations to such VoIP providers. The FCC has also imposed on VoIP providers the obligation to “port” customers’ telephone numbers when customers switch carriers and desire to retain their numbers. Other aspects of VoIP and Internet telephony services, such as regulations relating to the confidentiality of data and communications, copyright issues and taxation of services, may be subject to federal or state regulation. 
In a series of decisions issued in 2004, the FCC clarified that the FCC, not the state public utility commissions, has jurisdiction to decide the regulatory status of IP-enabled services, including VoIP. On November 12, 2004, in response to a request by Vonage Holdings Corp., a VoIP services provider, the FCC issued an order preempting traditional telephone company regulation of VoIP service by the Minnesota Public Utility Commission, finding that the service cannot be separated into interstate and intrastate communications without negating federal rules and policies. In April 2004, the FCC issued an order concluding that, under current rules, AT&T’s phone-to-phone IP telephony service is a telecommunications service upon which interstate access charges may be assessed. This decision, however, is limited to interexchange service that: (1) uses ordinary customer premises equipment with no enhanced functionality; (2) originates and terminates on the PSTN; and (3) undergoes no net protocol conversion and provides no enhanced functionality to end-users due to the provider’s use of IP technology. The FCC made no determination regarding retroactive application of its ruling, and stated that the decision does not preclude it from adopting a different approach when it resolves the IP-enabled services or intercarrier compensation rulemaking proceedings.
In November 2011, the FCC adopted intercarrier compensation rules under which all traffic, including VoIP-PSTN traffic, ultimately will be subject to a bill-and-keep framework. As of December 29, 2011, default rates for toll VoIP-PSTN traffic were required to be equal to interstate access rates applicable to non-VoIP traffic both in terms of rate level and rate structure; default rates for other VoIP-PSTN traffic were required to be reciprocal compensation rates. In addition, VoIP-PSTN traffic is subject to the same phase-down of access rates as are applied to traditional voice traffic. By a Declaratory Ruling released on February 11, 2015, the FCC clarified the applicability of the “VoIP symmetry rule” adopted in the action described above, making it clear that the VoIP symmetry rule is technology and facilities neutral and that, therefore, whether a CLEC partners with a facilities-based or an “over-the-top” VoIP provider, the CLEC is nonetheless deemed to be providing the “functional equivalent” of end office switching for access charge purposes.
Other Domestic Regulation
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, safety and health laws, and governmental regulations. These laws and regulations govern matters such as the generation, storage, handling, use, and transportation of hazardous materials, the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the atmosphere, the emission of electromagnetic radiation, the protection of wetlands, historic sites, and endangered species and the health and safety of employees. We also may be subject to laws requiring the investigation and cleanup of contamination at sites we own or operate or at third-party waste disposal sites. Such laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the contamination.
