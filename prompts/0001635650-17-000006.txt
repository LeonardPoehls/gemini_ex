 ﻿
 References to “we,” “our,” “us” or the “partnership” used in present tense for periods beginning on or after July 1, 2015, refer to Green Plains Partners LP and its subsidiaries. References to the “MLP predecessor” used in a historical context for periods ended on or before June 30, 2015, refer to BlendStar LLC and its subsidiaries, the partnership’s predecessor for accounting purposes, and the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the ethanol storage and leased railcar assets contributed by Green Plains in connection with the IPO on July 1, 2015. References to our “sponsor” in transactions subsequent to the IPO refer to Green Plains.     ﻿ Formation and Initial Public Offering and Subsequent Drop Downs
 ﻿
 We are a master limited partnership formed by our parent on March 2, 2015. On July 1, 2015, we completed our IPO of 11,500,000 common units representing limited partner interests. Our common units are traded under the symbol “GPP” on Nasdaq. After completing the IPO, in addition to the interests of BlendStar, we received the assets and liabilities of the ethanol storage and leased railcar assets, previously owned and operated by our parent, in a transfer between entities under common control.
 ﻿
 On January 1, 2016, we acquired the ethanol storage and leased railcar assets of the Hereford, Texas and Hopewell, Virginia ethanol production facilities from our sponsor in a transfer between entities under common control. The assets were recognized at historical cost and reflected retroactively along with related expenses for periods prior to the effective date of the acquisition, subsequent to the initial dates the assets were acquired by our sponsor, on October 23, 2015, and November 12, 2015, for Hopewell and Hereford, respectively. There were no revenues related to these assets for periods before January 1, 2016, when amendments to our commercial agreements related to the drop down became effective.
 ﻿
 On September 23, 2016, we acquired the ethanol storage assets located in Madison, Illinois; Mount Vernon, Indiana and York, Nebraska related to three ethanol plants, which occurred concurrently with the acquisition of these facilities by Green Plains from subsidiaries of Abengoa S.A. The transaction was accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control and the assets were recognized at the preliminary value recorded in Green Plains’ purchase accounting. No retroactive adjustments were required.
 ﻿
 Overview
 ﻿
 Green Plains Partners provides fuel storage and transportation services by owning, operating, developing and acquiring ethanol and fuel storage facilities, terminals, transportation assets and other related assets and businesses. We were formed by Green Plains, a vertically integrated ethanol producer, to support its marketing and distribution activities as its primary downstream logistics provider.
 ﻿
 We generate a substantial portion of our revenues under fee-based commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade for receiving, storing, transferring and transporting ethanol and other fuels, which are supported by minimum volume or take-or-pay capacity commitments. We do not take ownership or receive any payments based on the value of ethanol or other fuels we handle. As a result, we do not have direct exposure to fluctuating commodity prices.

 Our parent owns a 62.5% limited partner interest in us, consisting of 4,389,642 common units and 15,889,642 subordinated units, a 2.0% general partner interest and all of our incentive distribution rights. The public owns the remaining 35.5% limited partner interest. The following diagram depicts our simplified organizational structure at December 31, 2016:
 ﻿

 Our Assets and Operations
 ﻿
 Ethanol Storage.  Our ethanol storage assets are the principal method of storing ethanol produced at our parent’s ethanol production plants. Most of our parent’s ethanol production plants are located near major rail lines. Ethanol can be distributed from our storage facilities to bulk terminals via truck, railcar or barge.
 ﻿
 We own or lease 39 ethanol storage facilities and approximately 56 acres of land. Our storage tanks are located at or near our parent’s 17 ethanol production plants in Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.    ﻿

 Our ethanol storage tanks have combined storage capacity of approximately 38.6 mmg and aggregate throughput capacity sufficient for our parent’s current production capacity of 1,470 mmgy. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the ethanol storage assets had throughput of approximately 1,148 mmg, representing 90.0% of our parent’s daily average production capacity. The following table presents additional ethanol production plant details by location:

  ﻿
 (1) Throughput for the year ended December 31, 2016, relates only to the period since February 8, 2016, when Hopewell plant operations resumed.
 (2) The ethanol storage and railcar assets at the Madison, Mount Vernon and York plants were acquired on September 23, 2016. Throughput for the year ended December 31, 2016, relates only to the period since the assets were acquired. These plants allow us to access markets through multiple class one railroads, truck or barge.
 ﻿
 Terminal and Distribution Services. We own and operate eight fuel terminals with combined total storage capacity of approximately 7.4 mmg in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee and Oklahoma and access to major rail lines. We also own approximately five acres of land and lease approximately 19 acres of land where our fuel terminals are located. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the aggregate throughput at these facilities was approximately 308.2 mmg.    ﻿
 Ethanol is transported from our terminals to third-parties for blending with gasoline and transferred to a loading rack for delivery by truck to retail gas stations. Our Birmingham facility is one of 20 facilities in the United States capable of efficiently receiving and offloading ethanol and other fuels from unit trains.
 ﻿
 The following table presents additional fuel terminal details by location:
 ﻿
 ﻿

﻿ | | | 
------------------------------------------+------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+---------------------------

Other Fuel Terminal Facilities | (1) | 880 | 522 
﻿ | | 7,422 | 822 

  ﻿
 (1) Access to our seven other fuel terminal facilities is available from BNSF, KCS, Canadian National, Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and CSX.
 ﻿
 Transportation and Delivery. Ethanol deliveries to distant markets are shipped using major U.S. rail carriers that can switch cars to other major railroads or barge delivery to national or international ports. Currently, our leased railcar fleet consists of approximately 3,100 railcars with an aggregate capacity of approximately 90.6 mmg. We expect our railcar volumetric capacity to fluctuate over the normal course of business as our existing railcar leases expire and we enter into or acquire new railcar leases. Our volumetric capacity is used to transport product primarily from our ethanol storage facilities and third-party production facilities to other fuel terminals, including our own, international export terminals and refineries located throughout the United States.

We also own and operate a fleet of seven trucks that transport ethanol and other biofuels. Six additional trucks were ordered in January 2017.
 ﻿
 Segments 
 ﻿
 Our operations consist of one reportable segment with all business activities conducted in the United States.
 ﻿
 Our Relationship with Green Plains
 ﻿
 Our parent is a vertically integrated producer, marketer and distributor of ethanol and the second largest consolidated owner of ethanol plants in North America. Our parent mitigates commodity price volatility by owning and operating assets throughout the ethanol value chain, which differentiates it from companies focused only on ethanol production.
 ﻿
 We benefit significantly from our relationship with our parent. Our assets are the principal method of storing and delivering the ethanol our parent produces. Our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade account for a substantial portion of our revenues.
 ﻿
 Our parent has a majority interest in us through the ownership of our general partner, a 62.5% limited partner interest and all of our incentive distribution rights. We believe our parent will continue to support the successful execution of our business strategies given its significant ownership in us and the importance of our assets to Green Plains’ operations.
 ﻿
 We entered into several agreements with our parent, which were established in conjunction with the IPO, including: an omnibus agreement; a contribution, conveyance and assumption agreement; an operational services and secondment agreement; and various commercial agreements described below. For additional information, please refer to Note 3 – Initial Public Offering to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. For the agreements in their entirety and any subsequent amendments, please refer to Item 15 – Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules.
 ﻿
 Commercial Agreements with Affiliate
 ﻿
 A substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows are derived from our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade, our primary customer, including a (1) fee-based storage and throughput agreement, (2) Birmingham terminal services agreement, (3) fee-based rail transportation services agreement and (4) various other transportation and terminal services agreements. 
 ﻿
 Minimum Volume Commitments. Our storage and throughput agreement and certain terminal services agreements with Green Plains Trade are supported by minimum volume commitments. Our rail transportation services agreement is supported by minimum take-or-pay capacity commitments. Green Plains Trade is required to pay us fees for these minimum commitments regardless of actual throughput or volume, capacity used or the amount of product tendered for transport, which is intended to provide some assurance that we will receive a certain amount of revenue during the terms of these agreements. The nature of these arrangements is intended to provide stable and predictable cash flows over time.
 ﻿
 Storage and Throughput Agreement. Under our storage and throughput agreement, Green Plains Trade is obligated to throughput a minimum of 296.6 mmg of product per calendar quarter at our storage facilities. In addition, Green Plains Trade is obligated to pay $0.05 per gallon on all throughput volumes, subject to an inflation escalator based on the producer price index following the last day of the primary term’s fifth year. If Green Plains Trade fails to meet its minimum volume commitment during any quarter, Green Plains Trade will pay us a deficiency payment equal to the deficient volume multiplied by the applicable fee. The deficiency payment may be applied as a credit toward volumes throughput by Green Plains Trade in excess of the minimum volume commitment during the next four quarters, after which time any unused credits will expire. Green Plains Trade has met its minimum volume commitments for each of the quarters since inception of the storage and throughput agreement. At December 31, 2016, the remaining primary term of our storage and throughput agreement was 8.5 years. The storage and throughput agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 360 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term.
 ﻿
 The current minimum volume commitment was increased from 212.5 mmg to 296.6 mmg of product per calendar quarter in connection with the acquisitions of ethanol storage and leased railcar assets, effective January 1, 2016, and September 23, 2016. All other terms and conditions are substantially the same as the initial agreement.
 ﻿

 Terminal Services Agreement. Under our terminal services agreement for the Birmingham facility, Green Plains Trade is obligated to pay $0.036 per gallon on all throughput volumes, subject to a minimum volume commitment of approximately 2.8 mmg per month of ethanol and other fuels, equivalent to 33.2 mmgy, as well as fees for ancillary services, effective January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2019. Previously, the rate was $0.0355 per gallon. The agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 90 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term. Our other terminal services agreements with Green Plains Trade and third parties also contain minimum volume commitments with various remaining terms.    ﻿
 Rail Transportation Service Agreement. Under our rail transportation services agreement, Green Plains Trade is obligated to transport ethanol and other fuels by rail from identified receipt and delivery points and pay an average monthly fee of approximately $0.0243 per gallon for all railcar volumetric capacity provided over the remaining life of the agreement. The minimum railcar volumetric capacity commitment we provide to Green Plains Trade for our leased railcar fleet is currently 90.6 mmg and the weighted average remaining term of all railcar lease agreements is 3.1 years. At December 31, 2016, the remaining term of our rail transportation services agreement was 8.5 years. The rail transportation services agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 360 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term. 
 ﻿
 Effective November 30, 2016, the rail transportation services agreement was amended to extend the initial term of the agreement, effective July 1, 2015, from a six-year term to a ten-year term. All other terms and conditions remained the same as the initial agreement, as previously amended.
 ﻿
 We lease our railcars from third parties under multiple lease agreements with various terms. The minimum take-or-pay capacity commitment under the rail transportation services agreement is closely aligned with our existing railcar lease agreements. As a result, when current railcar lease agreements expire, the volumetric capacity provided under the rail transportation services agreement declines accordingly. We enter new lease agreements to replace scheduled capacity reductions under the rail transportation services agreement or provide incremental capacity as requested by Green Plains Trade. We do not speculate on capacity by leasing additional railcars that are not covered by the rail transportation services agreement.
 ﻿
 Green Plains Trade is also obligated to pay a monthly fee of approximately $0.0013 per gallon for logistical operations management and other services based on railcar volumetric capacity obtained by Green Plains Trade from third parties.    ﻿
 Trucking Transportation Agreement. Under our trucking transportation agreement, Green Plains Trade pays us to transport ethanol and other fuels by truck from identified receipt points to various delivery points. Green Plains Trade is obligated to pay a monthly trucking transportation services fee equal to the aggregate amount of product volume transported in a calendar month multiplied by the applicable rate for each truck lane, which is defined as a specific, routine route between point of origin and point of destination. Rates for each truck lane are negotiated based on product, location, mileage and other factors. At December 31, 2016, the remaining term of our trucking transportation agreement was six months. The trucking transportation agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 30 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term.
 ﻿
 Competitive Strengths
 ﻿
 We believe that the following competitive strengths position us to successfully execute our business strategies:
 ﻿
 Stable and Predictable Cash Flows. A substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows are derived from long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade, including a storage and throughput agreement, rail transportation services agreement, terminal services agreement and other transportation agreements. Our storage and throughput agreement and certain terminal services agreements are supported by minimum volume commitments, and our rail transportation services agreement is supported by minimum take-or-pay capacity commitments. Green Plains Trade is obligated to pay us fees for these minimum commitments regardless of actual throughput or volume, capacity used or the amount of product tendered for transport. 
 ﻿
 Advantageous Relationship with Our Parent. Our assets are the principal method of storing and delivering the ethanol our parent produces, and the related agreements with Green Plains Trade include minimum volume or take-or-pay capacity commitments. Furthermore, as general partner and owner of a 62.5% limited partner interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights, our parent directly benefits from our growth, which provides incentive to pursue projects that directly or indirectly enhance the value of our business and assets. This can be accomplished through organic expansion, accretive acquisitions or the development of downstream distribution services. Under the omnibus agreement, we are granted the right 

 
9

 
of first offer, for a period of five years from the date of the IPO, on any ethanol storage asset, fuel terminal facility or transportation asset our parent owns, constructs, acquires or decides to sell.
 ﻿
 Quality Assets. Our portfolio of assets has an expected remaining weighted average useful life of over 20 years. Our ethanol storage and fuel terminal assets are strategically located in fifteen states near major rail lines and barge service, which minimizes our exposure to weather-related downtime and transportation congestion, while enabling access to markets across the United States. Given the nature of our assets, we expect to incur only modest maintenance-related expenses and capital expenditures in the near future.
 ﻿
 Financial Strength and Flexibility. Our borrowing capacity and ability to access debt and equity capital markets provide financial flexibility necessary to achieve our organic and acquisition growth strategies.
 ﻿
 Proven Management Team.  Each member of our senior management team is an employee of our parent who also devotes time to manage our business affairs. We believe the level of commercial, operational and financial expertise of our senior management team, which averages more than 25 years of industry experience, allows us to successfully execute our business strategies.
 ﻿
 Business Strategy
 ﻿
 We believe ethanol could become an increasingly larger portion of the global fuel supply driven by volatile oil prices, heightened environmental concerns, energy independence and national security concerns. We intend to further develop and strengthen our business by pursuing the following growth strategies:    ﻿
 Generate Stable, Fee-Based Cash Flows.  A substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows are derived from our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade. Under these agreements, we do not have direct exposure to fluctuating commodity prices. We intend to continue to establish fee-based contracts with our parent and third parties that generate stable and predictable cash flows.
 ﻿
 Grow Organically.  We will collaborate with our parent and other potential third-party customers to identify opportunities to construct assets that provide us long-term returns on our investment. Plant expansion that increases our parent’s production capacity also increases annual throughput at our facilities. Capital expenditures associated with expansion are minimal since our ethanol storage facilities have available capacity to accommodate volume growth. 
 ﻿
 Acquire Strategic Assets.  We intend to pursue strategic acquisitions independently and jointly with our parent to grow our business. Our parent has a proven history of identifying, acquiring and integrating assets that are accretive to its business. Under the omnibus agreement, we have a right of first offer, for a period of five years from the date of the IPO, on any fuel storage, terminal or transportation asset our parent owns, constructs or acquires and decides to sell. In addition, we intend to continually monitor the marketplace to identify and pursue assets that complement or diversify our existing operations, including fuel storage and terminal assets in close proximity to our existing asset base.
 ﻿
 Development of Downstream Distribution Services.  Our parent will continue to use its logistical capabilities and expertise to further develop downstream ethanol distribution services that leverage the strategic locations of our ethanol storage and fuel terminal facilities.
 ﻿
 Conduct Safe, Reliable and Efficient Operations. We are committed to maintaining safe, reliable and environmentally compliant operations and conduct routine inspections of our assets in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. We seek to improve our operating performance through preventive maintenance, employee training, and safety and development programs. 
 ﻿
 Recent Developments
 ﻿
 The following is a summary of our significant developments during 2016. Additional information about these items can be found elsewhere in this report or in previous reports filed with the SEC.
 ﻿
 On January 1, 2016, we acquired the ethanol storage and leased railcar assets of the Hereford, Texas and Hopewell, Virginia ethanol production facilities from our parent for approximately $62.3 million. We used our revolving credit facility and cash on hand to fund the purchase. The acquired assets include three ethanol storage tanks that support the plants’ combined production capacity of approximately 160 mmgy and 224 leased railcars with volumetric capacity of approximately 6.7 mmg. We amended the storage and throughput agreement with Green Plains Trade, increasing the 

 
10

 
minimum volume commitment from 212.5 mmg to 246.5 mmg per calendar quarter. We also adjusted the rail transportation services agreement, increasing the minimum railcar volumetric capacity commitment 6.7 mmg to 79.6 mmg.
 ﻿
 On June 14, 2016, our parent and Jefferson Gulf Coast Energy Partners, a subsidiary of Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure Investors LLC, announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture to construct and operate an intermodal export and import fuels terminal at Jefferson’s existing Beaumont, Texas terminal. The joint venture is expected to invest approximately $55 million in its Phase I development, which will initially focus on storage and throughput capabilities for multiple grades of ethanol. The terminal will have direct access to multiple transportation options, including Aframax vessels, inland and coastwise barges, trucks, and unit trains with direct mainline service from the Union Pacific, BNSF and KCS railroads. Green Plains will offer its interest in the joint venture to the partnership once commercial development is complete, which is expected during the second half of 2017.
 ﻿
 On August 25, 2016, the partnership filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, registering an indeterminate number of debt and equity securities with a total offering price not to exceed $500,000,250 that was declared effective September 2, 2016. The partnership also registered 13,513,500 common units, consisting of 4,389,642 common units and 9,123,858 common units that may be issued upon conversion of subordinated units, in each case, currently held by Green Plains.
 ﻿
 On September 23, 2016, we acquired the ethanol storage assets located in Madison, Illinois; Mount Vernon, Indiana and York, Nebraska for $90 million related to three ethanol plants, which occurred concurrently with the acquisition of these facilities by Green Plains from subsidiaries of Abengoa S.A. The acquired assets include ethanol storage tanks that support the plants’ combined annual production capacity of approximately 236 million gallons. We used our amended revolving credit facility to fund the purchase. We amended the storage and throughput agreement with Green Plains Trade, increasing the minimum volume commitment from 246.5 mmg to 296.6 mmg per calendar quarter.
 ﻿
 In November 2015, we announced plans to form a joint venture to build an ethanol unit train terminal in the Little Rock, Arkansas area capable of unloading 110-car unit trains in less than 24 hours. Effective February 13, 2017, we entered into an agreement with Delek Renewables, LLC to form NLR Energy Logistics LLC, as a 50/50 joint venture. The project is expected to be completed in the second half of 2017 at a total cost of approximately $6.5 million, subject to issuance of various permits and execution of other necessary agreements. 
 ﻿
 Our Competition
 ﻿
 Our contractual relationship with Green Plains Trade and the integrated nature of our storage tanks with our parent’s production facilities minimizes potential competition for storage and distribution services provided under our commercial agreements from other third-party operators.
 ﻿
 We compete with independent fuel terminal operators and major fuel producers for terminal services based on terminal location, services provided, safety and cost. While there are numerous fuel producers and distributors that own terminal operations similar to ours, they are not typically focused on providing services to third parties. Independent operators are often located near key distribution points with cost advantages and provide more efficient services and distribution capabilities into strategic markets with a variety of transportation options. Companies often rely on independent operators when their own storage facilities cannot handle their volumes or manage their throughput adequately due to lack of expertise, market congestion, size constraints, optionality or the nature of the materials being stored.
 ﻿
 We believe we are well-positioned to compete effectively in a growing market due to our expertise managing third-party terminal services and logistics. We are a low-cost operator, focused on safety and efficiency, capable of managing the needs of multiple constituencies across geographical markets. While the competitiveness of our services can be impacted by competition from new entrants, transportation constraints, industry production levels and related storage needs, we believe there are significant barriers to entry that partially mitigate these risks, including significant capital costs, execution risk, complex permitting requirements, development cycle, financial and working capital constraints, expertise and experience, and ability to effectively capture strategic assets or locations.
 ﻿
 Seasonality
 ﻿
 Our business is directly affected by the supply and demand for ethanol and other fuels in the markets served by our assets. However, the effects of seasonality on our revenues are substantially mitigated through our fee-based commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade, which include minimum volume or take-or-pay capacity commitments.
 ﻿

Major Customer
 ﻿
 Revenues from Green Plains Trade totaled approximately $95.5 million, or 92.0%, and $42.5 million, or 83.5%, of our consolidated revenues during 2016 and 2015, respectively. We are highly dependent on Green Plains Trade and expect to derive most of our revenues from them in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the business risks of Green Plains Trade and any development that materially and adversely affects its operations, financial condition or market reputation could have a material adverse impact on us. For additional information, please read Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business.
 ﻿
 Regulatory Matters
 ﻿
 Government Ethanol Programs and Policies
 ﻿
 We are sensitive to government programs and policies that affect the demand for ethanol and other fuels, which in turn may impact the volume of ethanol and other fuels we handle. In the United States, the federal government mandates the use of renewable fuels under RFS II. The EPA assigns individual refiners, blenders and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are obligated to use based on their percentage of total fuel sales. The EPA has the authority to waive the mandates in whole or in part if there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply, or the requirement severely harms the economy or the environment.
 ﻿
 RFS II has been a driving factor in the growth of ethanol usage in the United States. When RFS II was established in October 2010, the required volume of renewable fuel to be blended with gasoline was to increase each year until it reached 15.0 billion gallons in 2015, which left the EPA to address existing limitations in both supply (ethanol production) and demand (usage of ethanol blends in older vehicles). On November 23, 2016, the EPA announced the final 2017 renewable volume obligations for conventional ethanol, which met the 15.0-billion-gallon congressional target for the first time, up from 14.50 billion gallons in 2016 and 14.05 billion gallons in 2015.
 ﻿
 In January 2017, the Trump administration imposed a government-wide freeze on new and pending regulations, which included the 2017 renewable volume obligations that was originally intended to go into effect on February 10, 2017. Regulatory freezes are a common practice during a change in administration and we currently believe the new presidential administration will continue to be supportive of ethanol in accordance with the current laws.
 ﻿
 On January 18, 2017, Valero Energy Corporation filed an action against the EPA, seeking to compel the EPA to perform certain non-discretionary duties required by the RFS program under the Clean Air Act. Within the filed action, Valero claims the EPA has failed to appropriately perform these duties, namely periodic reviews of the feasibility of achieving compliance with the requirements and the impact of the requirements on each individual and entity regulated under the program, i.e, point of obligation, since 2010. Valero has requested an injunction, which if granted would require the EPA to promptly conduct rulemaking to ensure the requirements of the program are met.
 ﻿
 Environmental Regulation
 ﻿
 Our operations are subject to environmental regulations, including those that govern the handling and release of ethanol, crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbon materials. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations may increase our overall cost of doing business, including capital costs to construct, maintain, operate, and upgrade equipment and facilities.
 ﻿
 Under the omnibus agreement, our parent is required to indemnify us from all known and certain unknown environmental liabilities associated with owning and operating our assets that occurred on or before the closing of the IPO. In turn, we agree to indemnify our parent from future environmental liabilities associated with the activities of the partnership. 
 ﻿
 Construction or maintenance of our terminal facilities and storage facilities may impact wetlands, which are regulated by the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under the Clean Water Act.
 ﻿
 Other Regulations
 ﻿
 On May 1, 2015, the DOT finalized the Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operational Controls for High-Hazard Flammable Trains, or DOT specification 117, which established a schedule to retrofit or replace older tank cars that carry crude oil and ethanol and braking standards intended to reduce the severity of accidents and new operational protocols. The rule may increase our lease costs for railcars over the long term. Additionally, existing railcars may be out of service for an 

 
12

 
extended period of time while upgrades are made, tightening supply in an industry that is highly dependent on railcars to transport product. We intend to strategically manage our leased railcar fleet to comply with the new regulations. Currently, all of our railcar leases expire prior to the retrofit deadline of May 1, 2023. 
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿
 We do not have any direct employees. We are managed and operated by the executive officers of our general partner, who are also officers of our parent, and our general partner’s board of directors. Our general partner and its affiliates have approximately 35 full-time equivalent employees under the direct management and supervision of our general partner for our operations.
 ﻿
 In addition, we have entered into service agreements with unaffiliated third-parties to provide railcar unloading and terminal services for several of our terminal facilities. Under these service agreements, the third parties are responsible for providing the personnel necessary for the performance of various railcar unloading and terminal services. The third parties are considered independent contractors and none of their employees or contractors are considered our employees, representatives or agents.
