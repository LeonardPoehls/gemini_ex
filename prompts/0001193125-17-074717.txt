ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 All references to the Liquidating Trust, we, us, our or the Company refer to Winthrop Realty Liquidating Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 General 
 Winthrop Realty Liquidating Trust was organized on July 28, 2016 as a liquidating trust pursuant to a plan of liquidation of Winthrop Realty Trust, which we refer to as Winthrop. Winthrop, which began operations in 1961 under the name First Union Real Estate Equity and Mortgage Investments and changed its name to Winthrop Realty Trust in 2005, was a real estate investment trust formed under the laws of the State of Ohio. Winthrop conducted its business through its wholly owned operating partnership, WRT Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as the Operating Partnership. From January 1, 2004 through August 5, 2016, Winthrop was externally managed by FUR Advisors LLC, which we refer to as FUR Advisors or our Advisor. Since August 5, 2016, FUR Advisors has continued to manage our assets. The Advisor is majority owned by Winthrops former executive officers and senior management, including Michael L. Ashner and Carolyn Tiffany, two of our Trustees. 
 Winthrops primary business was owning real property and real estate related assets. On April 28, 2014 Winthrops Board of Trustees adopted a plan of liquidation. The plan, which provided for an orderly liquidation of Winthrops assets, was approved by holders of a majority of Winthrops common shares of beneficial interests (Common Shares) at a special meeting of shareholders on August 5, 2014. Under the plan of liquidation, if all of the assets of Winthrop were not disposed of by August 5, 2016, the then remaining assets and liabilities of Winthrop would be assigned to a liquidating trust. 
 On August 5, 2016, in accordance with Winthrops plan of liquidation, Winthrop transferred the then remaining assets and liabilities, including its ownership interests in the Operating Partnership, to the Liquidating Trust. The Liquidating Trust is governed by a Liquidating Trust Agreement by and among Winthrop and Michael L. Ashner, Howard Goldberg and Carolyn Tiffany, as trustees. Upon the transfer of the assets and liabilities to us on August 5, 2016, each Common Share was automatically converted into one unit of beneficial interest in the Liquidating Trust, which we refer to as Units, and each holder of Common Shares become a beneficiary of the Liquidating Trust, which we refer to as beneficiaries. On October 3, 2016, Winthrop filed a Form 15 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) to terminate the registration of the Common Shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Winthrop ceased filing reports under that Act. In reliance on prior guidance by the SEC, the Liquidating Trust will only file with the SEC annual reports on Form 10-K and current reports on Form 8-K.
The sole purpose of the Liquidating Trust is to wind up the affairs of Winthrop by liquidating its remaining assets, satisfying the assumed liabilities, paying all costs and expenses of the Liquidating Trust and distributing the remaining proceeds to the beneficiaries. We have no objective to continue or engage in the conduct of a trade or business, expect as necessary for the orderly liquidation of the remaining assets. 
 Under the plan of liquidation Winthrop was not, and under our Liquidating Trust Agreement, we are not, permitted to make any new investments other than protective acquisitions or advances with respect to our existing assets. We are permitted to satisfy any existing contractual obligations including any capital call requirements and acquisitions or dispositions pursuant to buy-sell provisions under existing joint venture documentation and pay for required tenant improvements and capital expenditures at our real estate properties. We are also permitted to invest our cash reserves in short-term U.S. Treasuries or other short-term obligations. The Liquidating Trust Agreement enables us to sell any and all of our assets without further approval of the beneficiaries and provides that liquidating distributions be made to the beneficiaries as determined by our trustees. 
 Pursuant to the Liquidating Trust Agreement, our affairs are overseen by three trustees, Michael L. Ashner, Howard Goldberg and Carolyn Tiffany. Until such time as our remaining assets are less than $250 million, the Liquidating Trust is required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have one of its trustees satisfy the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). FUR Advisors continues to administer our day to day affairs including overseeing the operation, management and disposition of our remaining assets. For providing these and other services, FUR Advisors is entitled to a base management fee and, in certain instances, an incentive fee and termination fee. See Employees below for a description of the fees payable to FUR Advisors.

As a liquidating trust, Units are not freely transferable. Units will generally not be transferable except by will, intestate succession or operation of law. Therefore, the beneficiaries do not have the ability to realize any value from the Units except from distributions made by the Liquidating Trust, the timing of which will be solely at the discretion of our Trustees. 
 The Liquidating Trust will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the distribution of all of the remaining assets of the Liquidating Trust in accordance with the terms of the Liquidating Trust Agreement, or (ii) August 5, 2019. The Liquidating Trust may be extended beyond August 5, 2019 if our Trustees determine that an extension is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose of the Liquidating Trust. Although no assurances can be given, it is anticipated that the liquidation will be completed by December 31, 2018. 
 The dissolution process and the amount and timing of distributions involves risks and uncertainties. As such, it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate amount of liquidation proceeds that will actually be distributed to beneficiaries or the timing of such payments. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the distributions will equal or exceed the estimate of net assets presented in the Consolidated Statements of Net Assets. Prior to August 5, 2016, Winthrop paid liquidating distributions totaling $7.75 per Common Share. Subsequent to the transfer to the Liquidating Trust, liquidating distributions totaling $1.50 per Unit have been paid.

 Assets 
 At the time of the adoption of the plan of liquidation, Winthrop held 20 consolidated operating properties, 18 equity investments, eight loans receivable, one secured financing receivable and one loan security. At December 31, 2016, we held seven consolidated operating properties, six equity investments and one loan receivable. 
 At December 31, 2016 we had total assets of $473,913,000 and net assets in liquidation of $327,927,000. The net assets in liquidation at December 31, 2016 would result in liquidating distributions of approximately $9.00 per Unit. 
 Operating Properties 
 See Item 2. Properties for a description of our Operating Properties 
 Operating Property Activity 
 701 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York  capital contributions/refinancing  During 2016, Winthrop and us made additional capital contributions of $13,013,000 with respect to our interest in the venture that holds an indirect interest in the property located at 701 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York, bringing aggregate capital contributions through December 31, 2016 to $128,502,000. We have contractually obligated to contribute up to $137,256,000 to the venture. No capital contributions have been made in 2017, and no capital calls are expected for the remainder of 2017. 
 On November 1, 2016 this venture refinanced a portion of its existing indebtedness with a new $510,000,000 mortgage loan and a new $255,500,000 mezzanine loan. The new loans bear interest at a blended rate of LIBOR plus 6.49% per annum with a LIBOR floor of 0.40%, require payments of interest only and mature November 9, 2018, subject to three six-month extensions. These new loans replaced the existing mortgage and mezzanine loans in the aggregate amount of $615,000,000 and which bore interest at LIBOR plus 8% per annum. The existing $200,000,000 EB-5 mezzanine loan which bears interest at 5.9% per annum remains in place. 
 At closing, $237,500,000 of the mortgage loan and $176,000,000 of the mezzanine loan were drawn down. At December 31, 2016 the outstanding balances on the mortgage loan, mezzanine loan and EB-5 loan were $240,041,000, $203,466,000 and $195,000,000, respectively. The remaining $326,993,000 in the aggregate is available to be drawn down to fund completion of construction of the retail and hotel development.

446 Highline LLC (450 West 14th Street), New York, New York  refinancing  On April 13, 2016 the venture in which we hold a preferred equity interest refinanced the first mortgage debt collateralized by the underlying property. In connection with the refinancing, Winthrop funded approximately $3,175,000 to the venture to cover closing costs and to fund initial escrows. Of this amount, $2,540,000 is considered to be a capital contribution and the remaining $635,000 was a loan to its venture partner. The partner loan bore interest at 12% per annum and was due on July 5, 2016. The partner loan was repaid in full in July 2016. Upon repayment of the partner loan, the venture partner has been deemed to have made a capital contribution to the venture in the amount of the partner loan. 
Disposition Activity 
 Sullivan Center, Chicago, Illinois  sale of interest - On April 27, 2016 Winthrop sold its interests in this asset to its venture partner for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $95,270,000 which included the ownership interest in the mezzanine loan that was classified as a secured financing. The sale price was consistent with Winthrops liquidation value at December 31, 2015. 
 Lake Brandt, Greensboro, North Carolina  property sale - On May 12, 2016 Winthrop sold to an independent third party its residential property known as Lake Brandt Apartments for gross proceeds of $20,000,000 and received net proceeds of $6,296,000 after satisfaction of third party mortgage debt and closing costs. The liquidation value was $20,000,000 at December 31, 2015. 
 Highgrove, Stamford, Connecticut  property sale - On May 19, 2016 the venture in which Winthrop held an 83.7% interest sold its apartment building located in Stamford, Connecticut for gross proceeds of $87,500,000. Proceeds of the sale were used to fully satisfy the $77,767,000 mortgage loan collateralized by the property and the ventures remaining property in Houston, Texas. Exclusive of the forfeited deposits discussed below, the liquidation value of the property was $85,000,000 at December 31, 2015. 
 The property was previously under contract with a different purchaser which contract was terminated on January 21, 2016 due to the prospective purchasers inability to timely close. In accordance with the terms of that contract, the venture retained the prospective purchasers $5,000,000 deposit. Subsequently, the venture entered into a settlement agreement with the prospective purchaser which provided for a return of a portion of the retained deposit. In February 2016 the venture returned $1,000,000 of the previously retained deposit and, upon the sale of the property, the venture returned an additional $1,500,000 of the previously retained deposit. 
 Jacksonville, Florida  property sale  On June 30, 2016 Winthrop sold to an independent third party its warehouse property in Jacksonville, Florida for gross proceeds of $10,500,000. In connection with the sale, Winthrop provided seller financing of $8,400,000 which loan requires interest only payments and matures on July 1, 2019.

The liquidation value of the loan receivable was $2,756,000 at December 31, 2015. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016 we had no employees. Our day to day affairs are administered by the Advisor pursuant to the terms of an advisory agreement for five years effective January 1, 2013 which we refer to, as the same may be amended from time to time, as the Advisory Agreement. Upon expiration of the current term, the Advisory Agreement is automatically renewed for successive one-year periods unless terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Advisory Agreement. 
 Under the Advisory Agreement, our Advisor is paid a quarterly base management fee which, at December 31, 2016, equaled $880,000. The base management fee was determined based on the aggregate issuance price of the Common Shares at August 1, 2016. The Advisory Agreement provides that any liquidating distributions paid on account of Units that result in a reduction of the threshold amount (as described below) are deemed a reduction in the aggregate issuance price of the Common Shares, thereby resulting in a reduction of the base management fee. In addition to receiving a base management fee, our Advisor is entitled to receive an incentive fee for administering the Liquidating Trust and, in certain instances, a termination fee upon an early termination of the Advisory Agreement under certain circumstances. Further, our Advisor, or its affiliate, is also entitled to receive property management fees and construction management fees at commercially reasonable rates. 
 The incentive fee is equal to 20% of any amounts available for distribution in excess of the threshold amount and is only payable at such time, if at all, (i) when holders of our Units receive aggregate distributions above the threshold amount or (ii) upon termination of the Advisory Agreement if the net value of our assets exceeds the threshold amount based on then current market values and appraisals. That is, the incentive fee is not payable annually but only at such time, if at all, as we have paid liquidating distributions from and after December 31, 2016 in excess of the threshold amount ($271,614,000 on December 31, 2016 plus an annual return thereon equal to the greater of (x) 4% or (y) the 5 year U.S. Treasury Yield plus 2.5% (such return, the Growth Factor) less any distributions paid from and after January 1, 2017). The incentive fee will also be payable if the Advisory Agreement is terminated, other than for cause (as defined) by us or with cause by our Advisor, and if on the date of termination the net value of the Liquidating Trusts assets exceeds the threshold amount. At December 31, 2016 the threshold

 amount required to be distributed before any incentive fee would be payable to FUR Advisors was $271,614,000, which was equivalent to $7.58 per Unit. At December 31, 2016, based on our estimate of liquidating distributions, it is estimated that the Advisor would be entitled to an incentive fee of $8,319,000 upon disposition of all our assets. This amount has been accrued and is reflected in our net assets in liquidation at December 31, 2016. 
 With respect to the termination fee, it is only payable if there is (i) a termination of the Advisory Agreement for any reason other than for cause (as defined) by us or with cause by our Advisor, or (ii) a disposition of all or substantially all of our assets. The termination fee, if payable, is equal to the lesser of (i) the base management fee paid to our Advisor for the prior twelve month period or (ii) either (x) in the case of a termination of the Advisory Agreement, 20% of the positive difference, if any between (A) the appraised net asset value of our assets at the date of termination and (B) the threshold amount less $104,980,000, or (y) in the case of a disposition, 20% of any liquidating distributions paid on account of our Units at such time as the threshold amount is reduced to $104,980,000, which, based on current estimates, will be achieved at such time as additional liquidating distributions of approximately $4.65 per Unit in excess of the Growth Factor have been paid. For example, if all of our assets were sold and the proceeds therefrom were distributed to holders of Units at January 1, 2017, the termination fee would only have been payable if additional liquidating distributions of approximately $4.65 per Unit had been paid, and then only until the total termination fee paid would have equaled $9,496,000 (the base management fee for the twelve months prior to the approved plan of liquidation), which amount would be achieved when total additional liquidating distributions paid per Unit equaled approximately $5.69. At December 31, 2016 it is estimated that the Advisor will be entitled to a termination fee of $9,496,000 upon the disposition of our remaining assets. This amount has been accrued and is reflected in our net assets in liquidation at December 31, 2016. 
 Competition 
 We currently compete with other properties located in markets in which our assets are located both from an operations perspective and with respect to the disposition of our assets. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business and our net assets in liquidation. 
 We derive significant benefit from our present advisor structure, where our Advisors experienced management team provides us with resources at substantially less cost than if such persons were directly employed by us. Through its broad experience, our Advisors senior management team has established a network of contacts and relationships, including relationships with operators, financing sources, investment bankers, commercial real estate brokers, potential tenants and other key industry participants. 
 Environmental Regulations 
 Our operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. These are discussed further under Item 1A  Risk Factors. 
Segment Data 
 With the adoption of the plan of liquidation we have only one reporting and operating segment subsequent to July 31, 2014.
