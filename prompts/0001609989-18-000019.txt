ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Proposed Merger with General Mills, Inc.
On February 22, 2018, Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc., General Mills, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“GMI”), and Bravo Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of GMI (“Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, GMI agreed to acquire the Company for $40.00 per common share, in cash. 
On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Registrant (the “Merger”), with the Registrant continuing as the surviving company and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of GMI, and our common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ Stock Market. At the effective time of the Merger, each share of our common stock (other than shares of the Company’s common stock held by GMI, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned subsidiary of GMI, shares owned by the Company (including shares held in treasury) or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and shares owned by stockholders who have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive $40.00 in cash per share.
The boards of directors of each of GMI and the Registrant have approved the Merger Agreement and holders of more than 50% of the Registrant’s outstanding shares have approved the transaction. While no other approval of the Registrant’s Board of Directors or shareholders is required to complete the transaction, the closing of the Merger is subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
There is no assurance that the Merger will occur. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Pending Merger” in “Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Overview 
We are one of the fastest growing major pet food companies in the United States, selling dog and cat food made with whole meats, fruits and vegetables, and other high-quality, natural ingredients. BLUE is a billion dollar brand and is the #1 brand in the Wholesome Natural market segment. We currently have approximately 7% share of the U.S. pet food market and feed only 3% of the 184 million pets in the United States. With a proven new user acquisition strategy, we are committed to converting more pet parents into True Blue Believers and continuing to increase our share of the attractive $28 billion U.S. pet food market.
We believe we have built an exceptional company with a breakthrough brand and an innovative business model, backed by our mission and our belief in a large unmet consumer demand for pet food with high-quality, natural ingredients. 
Our History
Today, Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. (“BBPP”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “its,” and “our”) conducts its business exclusively through its wholly-owned operating 
1

subsidiary, Blue Buffalo Company, Ltd. (“Blue”) and its subsidiaries. Blue was originally formed in August 2002 as a limited liability company under the name The Blue Buffalo Company, LLC. In December 2006, Blue converted into a corporation under the name Blue Buffalo Company, Ltd. In July 2012, we undertook a corporate reorganization and exchanged the stock of Blue for the stock of BBPP, a newly formed Delaware corporation. As part of the corporate reorganization, BBPP established another Delaware corporation, Blue Pet Products, Inc., which then became the sole shareholder of Blue.
Our Industry 
Pet food is one of the largest consumer packaged goods ("CPG") categories in the United States. We estimate that the U.S. pet food industry had approximately $28 billion in retail sales in 2017. According to Euromonitor, the pet food industry had approximately $51 billion in additional retail sales outside the United States in 2017, bringing the total size of the global pet food industry to approximately $79 billion. 
U.S. pet food retail sales grew 57% between 2007 and 2017, which represents a compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of 5%, based on data from Euromonitor. The industry growth over this period has been fueled by the “humanization” of pets, as pets are increasingly regarded as family members. This humanization trend has led pet parents to increasingly evaluate pet foods in the same way they scrutinize their own food choices. As more pet parents seek better, more wholesome options for themselves, they also seek these types of options for their pets. As a result, a significant number of pet parents have demonstrated a willingness to pay a premium for pet food that they believe will enhance the well-being of their pets. The higher demand for natural food products and more specialized formulas for different life-stages, breed sizes, special needs and diet types has fueled premiumization in the industry, leading to the faster growth of products with higher revenue per pound. This premiumization trend has impacted all market segments and product types in the pet food industry.
Our Brand and Products
We have the broadest portfolio of products of any natural pet food brand in the United States. Our tailored product offerings enable our pet parents to satisfy their pet’s specific dietary, lifestyle and life-stage needs, offering them no-compromise product solutions. We also have a broad product portfolio across different product types, diet types, breed sizes for dogs, lifestages, flavors, product functions and textures and cuts for wet foods.
We operate our business on the basis of one reportable operating segment. For more information on our operating segment reporting, as well as financial information about geographic areas, see Note 2 - "Basis of Presentation" to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Our product portfolio enjoys a strong base of existing products, combined with a strong track record of significant and incremental new product introductions. We have a multi-year product development funnel we use to plan and manage our product development engine. Once a concept passes our screening criteria, we believe we can bring new products to the market significantly faster than our major competitors as a result of our singular focus on the Wholesome Natural market segment and our integrated in-house marketing, research and development and product development capabilities. Our retail partners also look to us to drive innovation and enable us to rapidly introduce new products into the marketplace.

We have five product lines under our master BLUE brand. Each of our product lines has a different nutritional philosophy and distinct personality. We continue to deepen each product line with new products, expand each product line’s shelf presence and support each product line with advertising:
▪ BLUE Life Protection Formula – introduced in 2003, this is our original and largest product line with the broadest flavor, functional and breed-specific variety. Products under this line may not refer to “BLUE Life Protection Formula” explicitly on their packaging as we group all food products that are not specifically designated as one of our other lines below;
▪ BLUE Wilderness – introduced in 2007, this is our high-meat, high-protein, grain-free ancestral feeding line and our second largest product line;
▪ BLUE Basics – introduced in 2010, this is our line of limited ingredient diet products for pets with food sensitivities;
▪ BLUE Freedom – introduced in 2012, this is our grain-free line that is a cousin of the original BLUE Life Protection Formula line; and
▪ BLUE Natural Veterinary Diet – introduced in 2015, this is our line of Therapeutic diets for pets, offered exclusively through veterinarians. 
Sales and Distribution Channels
We sell our products in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Mexico. The majority of our net sales are in the United States. In 2017, approximately 4% of our net sales were outside the United States. 
BLUE products are sold in specialty channels, including national pet superstore chains, regional pet store chains, neighborhood pet stores, farm and feed stores, eCommerce retailers, military outlets, hardware stores, and veterinary clinics and hospitals, as well as in a number of select grocery and mass retailers in the FDM channel in the United States. Our sales in the veterinary channel are currently minimal. 
Historically, we only sold our products directly to retailers in the specialty channels and through distributors that focus on the specialty channels. On August 1, 2017, we announced the introduction of our BLUE Life Protection Formula product line to a limited number of select grocery and mass retailers in the FDM channel in the United States. Throughout 2017 we expanded, and we expect to continue to expand, our distribution in the FDM channel. In 2017, management believes specialty channels accounted for 48% of U.S. pet food sales, with FDM channels accounting for the other 52%. Specialty channels include a diverse set of retailers with over 20,000 stores (which includes national pet superstore chains (i.e., PetSmart and Petco, including their websites), regional pet store chains (e.g., Pet Supplies Plus, Pet Supermarket, Petsense and Pet Valu), neighborhood pet stores, farm and feed stores (e.g., Tractor Supply Company and Mid-States), eCommerce retailers (e.g., Amazon, Chewy (a subsidiary of PetSmart) and Petflow), military outlets, hardware stores and 25,000 veterinary clinics. We historically chose to sell BLUE exclusively in the specialty channels as we believe these channels provided an optimal environment for us to interact with and educate pet parents and helped to position BLUE as a premium brand, and because retailers in these channels dedicate more shelf space to pet food, which grants consumers access to a broader range of our products. In 2017 we determined that partnering with leading grocery and mass retailers in the FDM channel was the next step in the natural evolution of our go-to-
3

market model that will allow us to reach more pet parents and feed more pets. Pet food sales in specialty channels have grown faster than pet food sales in the FDM channel for the past 20 years as a result of the expansion of the channel and its pet focused environment and superior product selection. While we expect growth of pet food sales in the specialty channels to continue to outpace growth in FDM due to rapid growth in eCommerce retailers, the gap between the channels is narrowing. We have experienced significant growth in our net sales to eCommerce retailers, and these sales have continued to grow faster than our net sales to national pet superstores. In fact, our net sales to national pet superstores declined in 2017 primarily due to reduced traffic trends at such stores.
Whether we sell our products directly to retailers or through distributors primarily depends on the size of the account and whether the account has account-operated distribution centers for its own outlets. We review accounts on a regular basis and may re-designate them as a direct or distributor account depending on our cost-to-serve them, trends in their business and channel and changes in their distribution capabilities. The majority of our products are sold directly to retailers. Our direct accounts include large national and regional chains with their own distribution capability, such as PetSmart, Petco, Tractor Supply Company, Pet Supermarket, Target, Kroger, Meijer, and Publix, as well as larger eCommerce retailers. In 2017, 59% of our net sales were generated from sales to PetSmart (including Chewy.com as of an estimated acquisition date of June 1, 2017) and Petco. We also experienced significant growth in our net sales to eCommerce retailers in 2017 and expect those sales to continue to increase both in absolute terms and as a percentage of net sales. If we were to lose any of these key customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.
Most of our retailers in the regional and neighborhood specialty channel and the farm and feed store channel are served through our distributors. We have multiple distributors in most of our geographic areas. These distributors specialize in, and typically carry a wide assortment, of pet products. We believe we are one of their largest brands. Our distributors provide mainly logistics services and limited in-field sales support, with sales and account acquisition being driven primarily by us and through in-bound interest directly from retailers. From time to time, we offer certain promotional incentives to distributors to help them build our business.
Our sales teams are organized by the type of retail accounts they sell to in order to optimize sales strategies and tools. Our National Accounts Team services large national chains, our Regional Accounts Team services regional pet store chains, neighborhood pet stores and farm and feed stores, our eCommerce Team services retail accounts, and our FDM Team serves our grocery and mass accounts with the support of a retail broker. These teams share a sales operations team, which assists them with planning, fulfillment, sales and market analytics and pet parent relations. We also have a Regional Accounts field sales force, which works closely with distributor representatives to acquire new accounts and improve our position at our existing accounts. We believe we have one of the largest sales forces dedicated to the regional and neighborhood pet and farm and feed channels.
In addition, we deploy our Pet Detectives, part-time pet-passionate team members, to help us fulfill our mission to educate fellow pet parents about pet nutrition. Pet Detectives interact with pet parents one-on-one as they shop for pet food in our retail partners nationwide, as well as in Canada, Mexico and Japan. Our Pet Detective program serves as an educational marketing and sales platform as it is a resource for both pet parents already feeding their pets BLUE and pet parents currently feeding their pets other pet food brands. The Pet Detectives allow us to engage pet parents with our brand story, our mission and our shared love for pets in an authentic manner.

Manufacturing Network
Our products, including those sold outside of the U.S., are currently manufactured through a hybrid network of owned and contracted manufacturing facilities and distributed from owned and contracted distribution centers. We currently operate a dry food production facility in Joplin, Missouri (the “Joplin Dry Food Facility”), which provided us with approximately 55% of our dry food production needs in 2017. The Joplin Dry Food Facility and our dry food manufacturing facility in Richmond, Indiana (the “Heartland Richmond Facility,”) which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2018, are expected to initially provide us with approximately 60% of our dry food production needs and expand up to approximately 85% of our dry food production needs over the next several years. In addition, we recently commenced operations at our first treats facility, which is adjacent to our existing facility in Joplin (the “Joplin Treats Facility”, together with the Joplin Dry Food Facility, “The Heartland Joplin Facilities”, and collectively with the Heartland Richmond Facility, our “Heartland Facilities”).
Our business arrangements with our third party contracted manufacturing facilities vary by contract manufacturing partner. With our largest, core contract manufacturers, we typically have multi-year contracts in place that guarantee an amount of monthly production capacity and annual or multi-year fixed tolling charges, while assuring the contract manufacturer a minimum order volume on a monthly or quarterly basis. This arrangement allows the contract manufacturer to achieve efficiencies in managing its facility, while assuring us of the capacity we need to meet our growing volume requirements. With contract manufacturers with whom we do not have multi-year contracts, we typically have commitments of capacity based on a rolling three months forecast. We work closely with each of our manufacturing partners and provide them with a rolling production forecast, which enables them to better capacity plan and sequence their production efficiently. 
Our natural ingredients are sourced primarily from suppliers in the United States. Our procurement team is responsible for assuring ingredient supply and pricing to meet forecasted demand. We contract and ensure availability directly with suppliers for most of the major ingredients in our dry foods, whether manufactured by us at our Heartland facilities or by our contract manufacturers. All supplier facilities then go through our rigorous quality qualification process based on our ingredient specifications before any ingredients are shipped. The manufacturing facilities in our manufacturing network then purchase these ingredients from suppliers approved by us on the terms we negotiated. This has allowed us to consolidate ingredient sourcing across our manufacturing network in order to negotiate favorable pricing and consistency on ingredients for dry foods, which make up the majority of our product portfolio. For wet foods and treats, our contract manufacturers negotiate directly with suppliers approved by us and purchase ingredients directly based on our specifications. We have detailed specifications for raw materials used in all of our products. In all cases, we purchase finished products from the contract manufacturers predominantly on a cost-plus basis. We pay our contract manufacturers on a dollar-per-pound basis for dry foods and dollar-per-unit basis for wet foods and treats. These arrangements allow us to control the cost structure of our products. At our Heartland Facilities, we are responsible for the direct procurement of all ingredients and packaging for products we manufacture in-house. 
Research and Development 
Our research and development and product development teams work together to develop natural products that we, as pet parents, would want to feed our pets. Our focus on natural ingredients is a core advantage as we continue to develop and build upon our expertise. The formulations and processes required for the manufacture of Wholesome Natural pet foods often are different from those of Engineered pet foods. 
5

For example, developing and managing the shelf life of products is more difficult when using only natural preservatives. In addition, wheat, which is a “natural” ingredient, is a low-cost but effective food binder that is commonly used in the pet food industry. Since we do not use wheat in any of our products, we have developed know-how and expertise in the use of ingredients other than wheat to act as food binders. Our research and development team, staffed with animal nutritionists with PhDs and food scientists, works on new technologies, formulations and testing. Our product development team provides consumer and market insight, as well as project management leadership. Working together with our in-house advertising and marketing agency, the two teams develop and launch new products and improve our existing products. We also work with external technical experts and suppliers to help us stay at the forefront of technological developments and advancements. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, our total research and development expenses were $11.3 million, $9.8 million and $9.5 million, respectively. These expenses include personnel costs, testing costs and expenses related to outside services.
Competitive Landscape
The pet food industry is highly competitive. We compete on the basis of product quality and palatability, brand awareness and loyalty, product variety and ingredients, interesting product names, product packaging and package design, shelf space (both online and in-store), reputation, price and promotional efforts. Our main competitors are large CPG companies with long histories and well-recognized brands. Companies with major pet food businesses include Nestlé, Mars, the J.M. Smucker Company (owner of Big Heart Pet Brands, formerly known as Del Monte) and Colgate-Palmolive.
The pet food industry is highly fragmented at the brand level, with over 100 brands with retail sales exceeding $10 million in 2017. Our major competitors typically follow a brand portfolio approach with each brand often having distinct positioning by species and/or product type. Unlike most of our competitors, we have a master BLUE brand with a strong identity on the top and individual product lines underneath. 
Over the last decade, all of our major competitors and many independent companies have also entered or have attempted to benefit from the fast-growing Wholesome Natural market segment through new brand introductions, brand extensions and/or acquisitions. These attempts have included entries directly into the Wholesome Natural market segment, as well as launching brands and products that have some but not all of the Wholesome Natural market segment’s characteristics. Most of the pet food brands we compete with in the Wholesome Natural market segment, such as the Wellness and Taste of the Wild brands, are not owned by major pet food companies but are instead owned by other pet food companies such as WellPet and Diamond Pet Foods, respectively. In 2017, we had approximately one-third market share in the Wholesome Natural market segment and were over four times the size of the next largest Wholesome Natural brand.
In 2017, the Therapeutic market segment had retail sales of over $1.7 billion in the United States and continued to grow at a higher rate than the overall pet food market. We believe there are significant barriers-to-entry to the Therapeutic market segment as it requires significant research and development expertise and investment, the ability to reach veterinary clinics through a separate sales force and distribution network, and compliance with specific FDA regulatory requirements and processes. After investing significant time and resources, we entered this market segment in 2015 with differentiated natural Therapeutic pet food products. Due to the significant barriers-to-entry, other than us, currently only three major pet food companies participate in the Therapeutic market segment in the United States.

Seasonality
Our business generally is not subject to seasonal fluctuations to any significant extent. 
Our Organization: “The Herd” 
Our company culture is an integral part of our strategy and one of our founding objectives is being a great place to work. We have a strong and dedicated team of employees we refer to as “the Herd,” where each one of us is a “Buff.” Our company culture is built on entrepreneurship, collaboration, a commitment to Blue Buffalo’s mission, a competitive spirit and a friendly, casual work environment. As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 1,800 Buffs, including full-time and part-time Buffs, none of whom was represented by a labor union. We believe we have a good relationship with our team members and that our company culture is a key competitive advantage and a strong contributor to our success. 
Our Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our primary trademarks include “Blue Buffalo,” “LifeSource Bits,” “Life Protection Formula,” “BLUE Basics,” “BLUE Freedom,” “BLUE Wilderness,” “BLUE Natural Veterinary Diet,” the BLUE shield logo and the Blue Buffalo figure logo, each of which is registered or has a trademark registration pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The Blue shield design logo is also registered or has a trademark registration pending in Canada, Mexico, Japan, Europe, Russia, China, Australia and approximately 28 other countries or registries. We also have numerous other trademark registrations and pending applications for product names and tag lines that are essential to our branding. Our trademarks are valuable assets that reinforce the distinctiveness of our brand and our consumers’ favorable perception of our products. The current registrations of these trademarks in the United States and foreign countries are effective for varying periods of time and may be renewed periodically, provided that we, as the registered owner, or our licensees where applicable, comply with all applicable renewal requirements including, where necessary, the continued use of the trademarks in connection with similar goods. In addition to trademark protection, we own numerous URL designations, including www.bluebuffalo.com and www.bluesbuddies.com. We also rely on and carefully protect unpatented proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations, continuing innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. 
Government Regulation 
Blue Buffalo, along with its contract manufacturers, distributors and ingredients and packaging suppliers, is subject to extensive regulation in the United States by federal, state and local government authorities including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA"), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as well as state and local agencies, with respect to registrations, production processes, product attributes, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution. We believe that we are in material compliance with all regulations applicable to our business.

Pet Food-Related Regulation 
The FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine, or CVM, regulates animal feed, including pet food, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and its implementing regulations. Although pet foods are not required to obtain premarket approval from the FDA, any substance that is added to or is expected to become a component of a pet food must be used in accordance with a food additive regulation, unless it is generally recognized as safe, or GRAS, under the conditions of its intended use. A food additive regulation may be obtained through the submission of a food additive petition to the FDA demonstrating that a food additive is safe for its intended use and has utility. Use of a food ingredient that is neither GRAS nor an approved food additive may cause a food to be adulterated, in which case the food may not be legally marketed in the United States.
The labeling of pet foods is regulated by both the FDA and some state regulatory authorities. FDA regulations require proper identification of the product, a net quantity statement, a statement of the name and place of business of the manufacturer or distributor, and proper listing of all the ingredients in order of predominance by weight. The FDA also considers certain specific claims on pet food labels to be medical claims and therefore subject to prior review and approval by the FDA. These include claims such as “hairball control” and “urinary tract health.” We currently produce pet food products, such as cat food with hairball management claims, which undergo FDA premarket review. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 requires the FDA to establish ingredient standards and definitions for pet food, processing standards for pet food, and updated labeling standards for pet food that include nutritional and ingredient information. The FDA is currently working to implement these requirements.
We currently produce products, such as those in our BLUE Natural Veterinary Diet line, which may provide all or most of the nutrients in support of an animal’s total daily nutrient needs but are also labeled and marketed with claims that may suggest that they are intended to treat or prevent disease, thereby potentially meeting the statutory definitions of both a food and a drug. In the past, the FDA has generally exercised discretion with regard to enforcement of the regulatory requirements applicable to animal drugs in the context of dog and cat foods (i) that provided nutrients in support of the animal’s total required daily nutrient needs, (ii) that were distributed only through licensed veterinarians, and (iii) with respect to which manufacturers restricted labeling claims. However, noting an increase in the number of dog and cat foods labeled as being intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, and noting that animal health may suffer when such products are not subject to pre-market FDA approval and are provided in the absence of a valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship, the FDA recently issued guidance containing a list of specific factors it will consider in determining whether to initiate enforcement action against products that satisfy the definitions of both an animal food and an animal drug, but which do not comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to animal drugs. These include, among other things, whether the product is only made available through or under the direction of a veterinarian and does not present a known safety risk when used as labeled. While we believe that we market our products in compliance with the policy articulated in the FDA’s guidance and in other claim-specific guidance, the FDA may disagree or may classify some of our products differently than we do, and may impose more stringent regulations applicable to animal drugs, such as requirements for pre-market approval and compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMPs, for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. In addition, we may produce more products that may be subject to FDA pre-market review, including new products we introduce to the Therapeutic market segment.
8

Under Section 423 of the FFDCA, the FDA may require the recall of an animal feed product if there is a reasonable probability that the product is adulterated or misbranded and the use of or exposure to the product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death. In addition, pet food manufacturers may voluntarily recall or withdraw their products from the market. We have in the past issued limited voluntary recalls of products that we considered did not meet our standards, whether for palatability, appearance or otherwise, in order to protect our brand and reputation.
Most states also enforce their own labeling regulations, many of which are based on model definitions and guidelines developed by AAFCO. AAFCO is a voluntary, non-governmental membership association of local, state and federal agencies that are charged with regulation of the sale and distribution of animal feed, including pet foods. The degree of oversight of the implementation of these regulations varies by state, but typically includes a state review and approval of each product label as a condition of sale in that state.
Most states require that pet foods distributed in the state be registered or licensed with the appropriate state regulatory agency. In addition, most facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods, including pet foods, must register with the FDA and must renew their registration every two years. This includes most foreign facilities, as well as domestic facilities. Registration must occur before the facility begins its pet food manufacturing, processing, packing or holding operations.
In 2011, the Food Safety Modernization Act, or FSMA, was enacted. The FSMA mandates, among other things, that the FDA adopt preventative controls to be implemented by pet food facilities in order to minimize or prevent hazards to food safety. Under the FSMA, the FDA finalized the Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, or CGMP, on September 17, 2015. The final rule has staggered compliance dates based on the business size. There are two components of the final rule with different compliance dates including CGMP requirements and the Preventive Controls. Blue Buffalo was required to be in compliance with the CGMP by September 2016 and was required to be in compliance with the Preventive Controls by September 2017. The FDA also finalized the Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) on November 27, 2015, with a compliance date of July 2017. The third relevant regulation is the Sanitary Transportation of Human and Animal Food, which had a compliance date of April 6, 2017. We believe that we are in compliance with those regulations in effect that are relevant to our business.
We also are subject to the laws of Canada, Mexico and Japan, as well as provincial and local regulations, with regard to products exported to those jurisdictions. In Canada, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and other provincial and local agencies. In Mexico, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food, or SAGARPA, the National Service of Health, Food Safety and Quality, or SENASICA, which is an administrative body of SAGARPA and other state and local agencies. In Japan, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the Ministry of the Environment and other local agencies. As we enter into new foreign markets, we will be subject to similar laws and regulation, and oversight by foreign governmental and regulatory agencies, in those jurisdictions.
Employee and Occupational Safety Regulation 
We are subject to certain state and federal employee safety and employment practices regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, and regulations 
9

governing prohibited workplace discriminatory practices and conditions. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards, including protecting our employees from accidents, providing our employees with a safe and non-hostile work environment and being an equal opportunity employer. 
Environmental Regulation 
As a result of our pet food manufacturing and packaging activities, we at our Heartland Facilities, and we and our contract manufacturers at their facilities, are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater and stormwater discharges, and the treatment, handling and storage and disposal of materials and wastes. 
Manufacturing Related Regulation 
In connection with our operations at our Heartland Facilities, we are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and certain state and local agencies which may inspect the facility and regulate health and safety issues. Operation at the Heartland Joplin Facilities also subjects us to regulation by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and local planning, zoning and health agencies and upcoming operations at the Heartland Richmond Facility will subject us to regulation by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management. The Heartland Facilities must also be registered with the FDA, and will need to comply with the applicable requirements established under the FDA’s final rules regarding Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventative Controls for Food for Animals.
