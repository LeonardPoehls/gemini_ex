ITEM 1. BUSINESS
References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “Hi-Crush Partners LP,” “we,” “our,” “us” or like terms when used in a historical context to reference operations or matters prior to August 16, 2012 refer to the business of Hi-Crush Proppants LLC, which is our accounting predecessor that contributed certain of its subsidiaries to Hi-Crush Partners LP on August 16, 2012 in connection with our initial public offering. Otherwise, those terms refer to Hi-Crush Partners LP and its subsidiaries. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “Hi-Crush Proppants LLC,” “our predecessor” and “our sponsor” refer to Hi-Crush Proppants LLC.
Overview
Hi-Crush Partners LP (together with its subsidiaries, the “Partnership”) is an integrated producer, transporter, marketer and distributor of high-quality monocrystalline sand, a specialized mineral that is used as a proppant to enhance the recovery rates of hydrocarbons from oil and natural gas wells. Our reserves, which are located in Wisconsin, consist of "Northern White" sand, a resource that exists predominately in Wisconsin and limited portions of the upper Midwest region of the United States. The Partnership owns and operates a portfolio of sand facilities with on-site wet and dry plant assets, including direct access to major U.S. railroads for distribution to in-basin terminals. We own and operate a network of strategically located terminals and an integrated distribution system throughout North America, including our PropStreamTM integrated logistics solution, which delivers proppant into the blender at the well site. 
Over the past decade, exploration and production companies have increasingly focused on exploiting the vast hydrocarbon reserves contained in North America’s unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs through advanced techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. In recent years, this focus has resulted in exploration and production companies drilling longer horizontal wells, completing more hydraulic fracturing stages per well and utilizing more proppant per stage in an attempt to efficiently maximize the volume of hydrocarbon recovery per wellbore. As a result, North American demand for proppant increased rapidly over the same period.
Beginning in August 2014 and continuing through the second quarter of 2016, oil and natural gas prices declined dramatically and persisted at levels well below those experienced during the middle of 2014. As a result, the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas fell dramatically from the high levels achieved during third quarter of 2014. Due to uncertainty experienced over the past two years regarding the timing and extent of a recovery, exploration and production companies sharply reduced their drilling and completion activities in an effort to control costs. As a result, our customers faced uncertainty related to overall activity levels, and well completion activity was significantly below levels experienced in 2014 and 2015. The combination of these and other factors reduced proppant demand and pricing during 2016 significantly from the levels experienced during 2014. Proppant demand did not decline as significantly as the rig count and well completion activity might imply, though, due to the continuing trend of longer laterals and increasing use of sand per lateral foot in well completions. Given the marginal improvement in exploration and production activity during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the energy industry's outlook for 2017 activity levels, we expect the recent years' downward trend in well completion activity to reverse over the next several quarters, which, when coupled with higher usage of frac sand per well, should result in an increased strong positive influence on demand for raw frac sand.
We utilize the significant oil and natural gas industry experience of our management team to take advantage of what we believe are favorable, long-term market dynamics as we execute our growth strategy, which includes the acquisition of additional frac sand reserves, the development of new excavation and processing facilities and the development of new terminal facilities and logistics related assets. We expect to have the opportunity to acquire significant additional acreage and reserves currently owned by our sponsor, including the 1,447-acre facility with integrated rail infrastructure, located near Independence, Wisconsin and Whitehall, Wisconsin (the "Whitehall facility"), in addition to potential acquisitions from unrelated third parties. 
General
The Partnership is a Delaware limited partnership formed on May 8, 2012. In connection with its formation, the Partnership issued a non-economic general partner interest to Hi-Crush GP LLC, our general partner, and a 100% limited partner interest to our sponsor, its organizational limited partner.
Acquisition of Hi-Crush Augusta LLC
In January 2013 and April 2014, the Partnership entered into agreements with our sponsor which ultimately resulted in the acquisition of 98.0% of the common equity interests in Hi-Crush Augusta LLC (“Augusta”), the entity that owns a 1,187-acre facility with integrated rail infrastructure, located in Eau Claire County, Wisconsin (the "Augusta facility"), for total cash consideration of $261.8 million and 3,750,000 newly issued convertible Class B units in the Partnership (the “Augusta Contribution”). Subsequently on August 15, 2014, our sponsor, as the sole owner of our Class B units, elected to convert all of the 3,750,000 Class B units into common units on a one-for-one basis.

Acquisition of D & I Silica, LLC
In June 2013, the Partnership acquired an independent frac sand supplier, D & I Silica, LLC (“D&I”), transforming the Partnership into an integrated Northern White frac sand producer, transporter, marketer and distributor. Founded in 2006, D&I was the largest independent frac sand supplier to the oil and gas industry drilling in the Marcellus and Utica shales. 
Acquisition of Hi-Crush Blair LLC
On August 9, 2016, the Partnership entered into a contribution agreement with the sponsor to acquire all of the outstanding membership interests in Hi-Crush Blair LLC ("Blair"), the entity that owned our sponsor's 1,285-acre facility with integrated rail infrastructure, located near Blair, Wisconsin (the "Blair facility"), for $75.0 million in cash, 7,053,292 of newly issued common units in the Partnership, and payment of up to $10.0 million of contingent earnout consideration (the "Blair Contribution"). The Partnership completed the acquisition of the Blair facility on August 31, 2016.
Assets and Operations
According to John T. Boyd Company, a leading mining consulting firm focused on the mineral and natural gas industries (“John T. Boyd”), our proven reserves consist entirely of “Northern White” sand exceeding American Petroleum Institute (“API”) minimum specifications. Analysis of our sand by independent third-party testing companies indicates that it demonstrates characteristics in excess of API minimum specifications with regard to crush strength (ability to withstand high pressures), turbidity (low levels of contaminants) and roundness and sphericity (facilitates hydrocarbon flow or conductivity). 
Wyeville Facility
We own and operate a 971-acre facility with integrated rail infrastructure, located in Wyeville, Wisconsin (the "Wyeville facility"), which, as of December 31, 2016, contained 76.4 million tons of proven recoverable reserves of frac sand meeting API specifications. The Wyeville facility, completed in 2011 and expanded in 2012, has an annual processing capacity of approximately 1,850,000 tons of frac sand per year. Assuming production at the rated capacity and based on a reserve report prepared by John T. Boyd, our Wyeville facility has an implied reserve life of 41 years as of December 31, 2016.
All of the product from the Wyeville facility is shipped by rail from approximately 32,000 feet of track that connects our facility to a Union Pacific Railroad mainline. These rail spurs and the capacity of the associated product storage silos allow us to accommodate a large number of rail cars. It also enables us to accommodate unit trains, which significantly increases our efficiency in meeting our customers’ frac sand transportation needs. Unit trains, typically 80 rail cars in length or longer, are dedicated trains chartered for a single delivery destination. Generally, unit trains receive priority scheduling and do not switch cars at various intermediate junctions, which results in a more cost-effective and expedited method of shipping than the standard method of rail shipment. 
Augusta Facility
The Augusta facility, as of December 31, 2016, contained 40.9 million tons of proven recoverable reserves of frac sand meeting API specifications. Construction of the Augusta facility was completed in June 2012 and we expanded the facility in 2014. The Augusta facility has an annual processing capacity of approximately 2,860,000 tons of frac sand per year. Assuming production at the rated capacity and based on a reserve report prepared by John T. Boyd, our Augusta facility has an implied reserve life of 14 years as of December 31, 2016. During September 2016, we resumed production at the Augusta facility, which was previously idled in October 2015 as a result of market conditions.
All of the product from the Augusta facility is shipped by rail from approximately 28,800 feet of track that connects our facility to a Union Pacific Railroad mainline. These rail spurs and the capacity of the associated product storage silos allow us to accommodate a large number of rail cars, including unit trains.
Blair Facility
The Blair facility, as of December 31, 2016, contained 117.7 million tons of proven recoverable reserves of frac sand meeting API specifications. Construction of the Blair facility was completed in March 2016. The Blair facility has an annual processing capacity of approximately 2,860,000 tons of frac sand per year. Assuming production at the rated capacity and based on a reserve report prepared by John T. Boyd, our Blair facility has an implied reserve life of 41 years as of December 31, 2016. 
All of the product from the Blair facility is shipped by rail from approximately 43,000 feet of track that connects our facility to a Canadian National Railroad mainline. These rail spurs and the capacity of the associated product storage silos allow us to accommodate a large number of rail cars, including unit trains.

Sponsor's Whitehall Facility
Our sponsor's Whitehall facility, as of December 31, 2016, contained 80.7 million tons of proven recoverable reserves of frac sand meeting API specifications. The Whitehall facility, completed in September 2014, has an annual processing capacity of approximately 2,860,000 tons of frac sand per year. During 2016, the Partnership purchased 413,781 tons from our sponsor's Whitehall facility. Assuming production at the rated capacity and based on a reserve report prepared by John T. Boyd, the Whitehall facility has an implied reserve life of 28 years as of December 31, 2016. As a result of market conditions, the Whitehall facility was temporarily idled during the second quarter of 2016 and is expected to resume operations in late March or early April 2017. 
All of the product from the Whitehall facility is shipped by rail from approximately 30,000 feet of track that connects the facility to a Canadian National Railroad mainline. These rail spurs and the capacity of the associated product storage silos allow us to accommodate a large number of rail cars, including unit trains.
Terminal Facilities
As of December 31, 2016, we own or operate 11 terminal locations throughout Colorado, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York and Texas, of which three are temporarily idled and six are capable of accommodating unit trains. Our terminals include approximately 74,000 tons of rail storage capacity and approximately 120,000 tons of silo storage capacity. Each terminal location is strategically positioned in the shale plays to facilitate our customers' operations. Our terminals include rail-to-truck and rail-to-storage capabilities and serve as the base for a majority of our terminal resources and materials management services. Our terminal facilities include origin and distribution material staging areas, rail track capabilities, material handling equipment, private rail fleet, bulk storage and quality assurance services.
Our terminals are strategically located to provide access to Class I railroads, which enables us to cost effectively ship product from our production facilities in Wisconsin. As of December 31, 2016, we leased or owned 4,200 railcars used to transport our sand from origin to destination and managed a fleet of approximately 1,358 additional railcars dedicated to our facilities by our customers or the Class I railroads. 
PropStream Operations
In September 2016, the Partnership and other partners formed Proppant Express Investments, LLC (“PropX”), which was established to develop critical last-mile logistics equipment for the proppant industry. In October 2016, the Partnership announced the successful pilot test of its PropStream integrated logistics solution, which involves loading proppant at in-basin terminals into PropX containers before being transported by truck to the well site. The containers utilize intermodal container chassis or standard flatbeds for transportation, resulting in significant savings both in terms of up-front and ongoing operations costs versus widely-used pneumatic equipment. PropStream allows for increased transportation efficiency and a reduction in supply chain related congestion at well sites, lowering the number of trucks required per job and meaningfully reducing or eliminating demurrage costs.
At the well site, the proprietary conveyor system (“PropBeast™”) significantly reduces noise and dust emissions due to its enclosed environment. By reducing particulate matter emissions from sand operations at the well site by more than 90% versus the widely-used pneumatic equipment alternative. Our PropStream integrated logistics solution is designed to provide a viable solution to meet the new U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) respirable crystalline silica standards set to become effective in 2018 with respect to hydraulic fracturing, as well as the engineering control obligations set to become effective in 2021 for hydraulic fracturing.
As of December 31, 2016, we owned 6 PropBeast conveyors and leased 300 containers from PropX. 
Competitive Strengths
We believe that we are well positioned to successfully execute our strategy and achieve our primary business objectives to provide capital appreciation and increase our cash distributions per unit over time because of the following competitive strengths:

• | Competitive operating cost structure. Our plant operations have been strategically designed to provide low per-unit production costs with a significant variable component for the excavation and processing of our sand. Due to the shallow overburden at our and our sponsor's facilities, we are able to use surface mining equipment, and dredging at our Wyeville facility, in our operations, which provides for a lower cost structure than underground mining operations. Our mining operations are subcontracted at a fixed cost per ton excavated, subject to a diesel fuel surcharge. Unlike many competitors, our processing and rail loading facilities are located on-site, which eliminates the requirement for on-road transportation, lowers product movement costs and minimizes the reduction in sand quality due to handling.

• | Long-lived, high quality reserve base. Our Wyeville, Augusta and Blair facilities and our sponsor's Whitehall facility contain approximately 315.7 million tons of proven recoverable saleable frac sand reserves as of December 31, 2016, based on third-party reserve reports by John T. Boyd, and have an implied average reserve life of 30 years, assuming production at the rated capacity of each facility. These reserves consist of high quality Northern White frac sand. Analysis by independent third-party testing companies indicates that our sand demonstrates characteristics exceeding API specifications with regard to crush strength, turbidity and roundness and sphericity. As a result, our raw frac sand is particularly well suited for use in the hydraulic fracturing of unconventional oil and natural gas wells. 


• | Intrinsic logistics and infrastructure advantage. The strategic location and logistics capabilities of our Wyeville, Augusta and Blair facilities and our sponsor's Whitehall facility enable us to serve all major U.S. and Canadian oil and natural gas producing basins. At our Wyeville and Augusta facilities, our on-site transportation assets include approximately 32,000 feet and 28,800 feet, respectively, of track off a Union Pacific Railroad mainline. The on-site transportation assets at our Blair facility and our sponsor's Whitehall facility include on-site rail yards that contain approximately 43,000 feet and 30,000 feet, respectively, of track off a Canadian National Railroad mainline. All of our and our sponsor's facilities are capable of accommodating unit trains, allowing our customers to receive priority scheduling, expedited delivery and a more cost-effective shipping alternative. Our logistics capabilities enable efficient loading of sand and minimize rail car turnaround times at the facilities. We expect to acquire or develop similar logistics capabilities at any facilities we own in the future. We believe we are one of the few frac sand producers with facilities initially designed to deliver frac sand exceeding API specifications to all of the major U.S. oil and natural gas producing basins by on-site rail facilities, including on-site storage capacity accommodating unit trains. 


• | Strategically located terminal facilities. We operate through an extensive logistics network of rail-based terminals that we own strategically located throughout Colorado, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York and Texas, as well as facilities owned and operated by third parties, to serve our customers' operations in North America's shale and other unconventional oil and natural gas plays. Many of our terminals are capable of handling unit trains, further reducing the cost of delivered sand for our customer. Our distribution network allows us to better service our customers’ short-notice needs in these basins, and at a lower price, and provide our customers with solutions to the logistical challenges presented by the large volume of sand typically required for each fracturing job. 


• | Developing “last mile” capabilities. Our investment in PropX and the development of our PropStream integrated logistics solution expand the reach and delivery of frac sand directly to our customers’ usage points, while leveraging our logistics infrastructure advantage and utilizing our strategically located terminal facilities. The addition of “last mile” capabilities to our portfolio of services is aligned with our goals of delivering frac sand from the mine to the well more efficiently, expanding our potential customer base, and positioning us deeper into the sand supply chain. 


• | Long-term customer relationships. We generate a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of frac sand to customers with whom we have long-term relationships, supported by contracts. The contracts specify monthly volume requirements for customers and have an average remaining contractual term of 2.9 years. In 2015, as a result of the market dynamics existing during the year, and continuing in 2016, we began providing market-based pricing to our contract customers and/or make-whole waivers in certain circumstances in exchange for, among other things, additional term and/or volume. We believe our long-term relationships with our customers provide us with a stable base of cash flows. 


• | Experienced and incentivized management team. Our management team has extensive experience investing and operating in the oil and natural gas industry, long-term relationships with participants in the oilfield services and exploration and production industries, a strong operational and commercial understanding of the markets in which our customers operate, and expertise in development, construction and operation of frac sand processing and terminal facilities, frac sand supply chain management, and bulk solids material handling. Our management team is focused on optimizing our current business and expanding our operations through disciplined development and accretive acquisitions and, together with members of our board of directors, are strongly incentivized to profitably and prudently grow our business and cash flows through their 13% direct and indirect ownership interest in our limited partnership units, and their 39% interest in our sponsor, which owned 20,693,643 common units and incentive distribution rights as of February 10, 2017.

Business Strategies
Our primary business objectives are to provide capital appreciation and pay cash distributions per unit over time. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following strategies:

• | Capitalizing on compelling industry fundamentals. We intend to continue to position ourselves as a leading producer, transporter, marketer and distributor of high quality frac sand, as we believe the frac sand market offers attractive growth fundamentals over the long-term. The innovations in horizontal drilling in the various North American shales and other unconventional oil and natural gas plays has resulted in greater demand for frac sand per well and per stage. The long-term growth in sand demand is underpinned by continued horizontal drilling, increasing proppant use per well and cost advantages over other proppant types. The proppant use per well has continued to increase even in the face of depressed hydrocarbon prices. We believe increases in frac sand supply will be constrained by the difficulty in finding reserves that meet or exceed API technical specifications in contiguous quantities large enough to justify the capital investment required and overcome the challenges associated with successfully obtaining the necessary local, state and federal permits required for operations. 


• | Building on our position as a low cost provider. We seek to maintain and improve our position as a low cost provider of sand. Our plant operations have been strategically designed to provide low per-unit production costs with a significant variable component for the excavation and processing of our sand. We will continue to analyze and pursue organic expansion efforts that will similarly allow us to cost-effectively optimize our existing assets. In addition, we seek to identify and evaluate terminal sites to expand our geographic footprint allowing us to enhance our distribution network and ensure that sand is available to meet the in-basin needs of our customers. Through a combination of our low cost production, our network of owned and operated terminals or third-party operated sites and our PropStream integrated logistics solution, we expect to find ways to reduce our customers' cost of sand delivered to the blender at the well site. We will continue to analyze and pursue third-party acquisition opportunities that would similarly allow us to cost-effectively expand our geographic footprint, optimize our existing assets and meet our customers' demand for our high quality frac sand. 


• | Focusing on long-term relationships with key customers. A key component of our business model has been our contracting strategy, which seeks to secure a high percentage of our cash flows under long-term contracts with the major pressure pumping service providers who generally are our customers. We believe this business model serves as the foundation for our ability to serve our customers, while providing the product that is a critical component to the well completion service. We intend to utilize a substantial majority of our processing capacity to fulfill our customer contracts and continue to serve our existing and new customers with frac sand delivered through our distribution network and to the blender at the well site. 


• | Pursuing accretive acquisitions from our sponsor and third parties. In June 2013, we acquired D&I, enabling us to operate through an extensive logistics network of rail-based terminals now strategically located throughout Colorado, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York and Texas. In January 2013 and April 2014, the Partnership entered into contribution agreements with our sponsor to acquire substantially all of the equity interests in our sponsor’s Augusta facility. On August 9, 2016, the Partnership entered into a contribution agreement with our sponsor to acquire all of the outstanding membership interests in Blair. We expect to continue pursuing accretive acquisitions of frac sand facilities from our sponsor, including the Whitehall facility, as well as third-party frac sand production and/or distribution and logistics operations. As we evaluate acquisition opportunities, we intend to remain focused on operations that complement our reserves of premium frac sand and that provide or would accommodate the development and construction of rail or other advantaged logistics and distribution capabilities. We believe these factors are critical to our business model and are important characteristics for any potential acquisitions. 


• | Maintaining financial flexibility and ample liquidity. We continue to pursue a disciplined financial policy and maintain liquidity aligned with our future debt maturities and financing needs. As of February 10, 2017, our senior secured term loan facility that permits aggregate borrowings of $200.0 million was fully drawn with a $194.5 million balance outstanding and we had $66.2 million of undrawn borrowing capacity ($75.0 million, net of $8.8 million letter of credit commitments) and had no indebtedness under our senior secured revolving credit agreement (the "Revolving Credit Agreement"). The Revolving Credit Agreement is available to fund working capital and general corporate purposes, including the making of certain restricted payments permitted therein. Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets. In 2016, we successfully completed three public offerings for a total of 19,550,000 common units for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $189.0 million. In January 2017, we entered into an equity distribution program under which we may sell through or to certain financial institutions up to $50.0 million in common units. We believe that our borrowing capacity and ability to access debt and equity capital markets provides us with the financial flexibility necessary to achieve our organic expansion and acquisition strategy.

Our Industry 
The oil and natural gas proppant industry is comprised of businesses involved in the mining or manufacturing of the propping agents used in the drilling and completion of oil and natural gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing is the most widely used method for stimulating increased production from wells. The process consists of pumping fluids, mixed with granular proppants, into the geologic formation at pressures sufficient to create fractures in the hydrocarbon-bearing rock. Proppant-filled fractures create conductive channels through which the hydrocarbons can flow more freely from the formation into the wellbore and then to the surface.
Industry Data
The market and industry data included throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K was obtained through our own internal analysis and research, coupled with industry publications, surveys, reports and other analysis conducted by third parties. Industry publications, surveys, reports and other analysis generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. Although we believe that the industry reports are generally reliable, we have not independently verified the industry data from third-party sources. Although we believe our internal analysis and research is reliable and appropriate, such internal analysis and research has not been verified by any independent source.
Types of Proppant
There are three primary types of proppant that are commonly utilized in the hydraulic fracturing process: raw frac sand, which is the product we produce, resin-coated sand and manufactured ceramic beads.
Raw Frac Sand
Of the three primary types of proppant, raw frac sand is the most widely used due to its broad applicability in oil and natural gas wells and its cost advantage relative to other proppants. Raw frac sand has been employed in nearly all major U.S. oil and natural gas producing basins.
Raw frac sand is generally mined from the surface or underground, and in some cases crushed, and then cleaned, dried and sorted into consistent mesh sizes. The API has a range of guidelines it uses to evaluate frac sand grades and mesh sizes. In order to meet API specifications, frac sand must meet certain thresholds related to crush strength (ability to withstand high pressures), roundness and sphericity (facilitates hydrocarbon flow, or conductivity), particle size distribution, and low turbidity (low levels of contaminants). Oil and gas producers generally require that frac sand used in their drilling and completion processes meet API specifications.
Raw frac sand can be further delineated into two main types: Northern White and Brady Brown. Northern White, which is the type of frac sand we produce, is known for its high crush strength, low turbidity, roundness and sphericity and monocrystalline grain structure. Northern White frac sand historically has commanded premium prices relative to Brady Brown. Brady Brown is sometimes preferred due to its proximity to shale basins, particularly the Permian basin and Eagle Ford shale, and, therefore, lower costs due to reduced logistics costs. Northern White has historically experienced the greatest market demand relative to supply, due both to its superior physical characteristics and the fact that it is a limited resource that exists predominately in Wisconsin and other limited parts of the upper Midwest region of the United States. However, even within this superior class of Northern White sand, its quality can vary significantly across deposits due to the differing geological processes that formed the various Northern White reserves.
The term “Northern White” is a commonly-used designation for premium white sand produced in Wisconsin and other limited parts of the upper Midwest region of the United States.
Resin-Coated Frac Sand
Resin-coated frac sand consists of raw frac sand that is coated with a flexible resin that increases the sand’s crush strength and prevents crushed sand from dispersing throughout the fracture. Pressured (or tempered) resin-coated sand primarily enhances crush strength, thermal stability and chemical resistance, allowing the sand to perform under harsh downhole conditions. Curable (or bonding) resin-coated frac sand uses a resin that is designed to bond together under closure stress and high temperatures, preventing proppant flowback. 
Ceramics
Ceramic proppant is a manufactured product of comparatively consistent size and spherical shape that typically offers the highest crush strength relative to other types of proppants. Ceramic proppant derives its product strength from the molecular structure of its underlying raw material and is designed to withstand extreme heat, depth and pressure environments.
8

Proppant Mesh Sizes
Mesh size is used to describe the size of the proppant and is determined by sieving the proppant through screens with uniform openings corresponding to the desired size of the proppant. Each type of proppant comes in various sizes, categorized as mesh sizes, and the various mesh sizes are used in different applications in the oil and natural gas industry. The mesh number system is a measure of the number of equally sized openings there are per square inch of screen through which the proppant is sieved. For example, a 30 mesh screen has 30 equally sized openings per linear inch. Therefore, as the mesh size increases, the granule size decreases. In order to meet API specifications, 90% of the proppant described as 30/50 mesh size proppant must consist of granules that will pass through a 30 mesh screen but not through a 50 mesh screen. We excavate various mesh sizes at our facilities, and sell 20/40, 30/50, 40/70 and 100 mesh frac sand used in the hydraulic fracturing process.
Frac Sand Extraction, Processing and Distribution
Raw frac sand is a naturally occurring mineral that is mined and processed. While the specific extraction method utilized depends primarily on the geologic setting, most raw frac sand is mined using conventional open-pit bench extraction methods. The composition, depth and chemical purity of the sand also dictate the processing method and equipment utilized. For example, broken rock from a sandstone deposit may require one, two or three stages of crushing to produce sand grains required to meet API specifications. In contrast, unconsolidated deposits (loosely bound sediments of sand), like those found at our Wyeville facility, may require little or no crushing during the excavation process. After extraction, the raw frac sand is washed with water to remove fine impurities such as clay and organic particles. The final steps in the production process involve the drying and sorting of the raw frac sand according to mesh size.
Most frac sand is shipped in bulk from the processing facility to terminal facilities, or directly to the customers by truck, rail or barge. For bulk raw frac sand, transportation costs often represent a significant portion of the customer’s overall product cost. Consequently, shipping in large quantities, including by unit train particularly when shipping over long distances, provides a significant cost advantage to the customer, emphasizing the importance of rail or barge access for low cost delivery. As a result, facility location and logistics capabilities are among the most important considerations for producers, distributors and customers.
All of the product from our Wyeville and Augusta facilities is shipped by rail from on-site rail yards off a Union Pacific Railroad mainline. All of the product from our Blair facility and our sponsor's Whitehall facility is shipped by rail from on-site rail yards off a Canadian National Railroad mainline. The length of our rail spurs, size of the rail yards and the capacity of the associated product storage silos allow us to accommodate a large number of rail cars. They also enable us to accommodate unit trains, which significantly increases our efficiency in meeting our customers’ frac sand transportation needs.
Designing and using an optimized logistics system is a key strategy for many proppant suppliers, including us, to reduce transportation costs and thereby the final proppant cost for end users. As locating proppant production close to key markets is not always possible, proppant suppliers will often have terminals in regions that they serve.  The ability to deliver sand shorter distances with fewer intermediate steps is instrumental in remaining cost competitive or gaining cost advantages.  Proppants are moved from the production site by rail or barge to transload or storage facilities.  From there, they are typically transported by truck to the well site. Strategically locating transload facilities can therefore reduce the amount of conveyance by truck, which is typically the most expensive mode of transport. Use of containerized storage systems for transportation of proppant from the transload facilities to the well site allows for a reduction in supply chain related congestion at the well site, also offering a reduction in overall transportation costs of proppant for the end users.
Demand Trends
Demand growth for frac sand and other proppants is primarily due to advancements in oil and natural gas drilling and well completion technology and techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, as well as overall industry activity growth. These advancements have made the extraction of oil and natural gas increasingly cost-effective in formations that historically would have been unprofitable to develop, resulting in a greater number of wells being drilled. Despite depressed levels of activity in 2015 and throughout most of 2016 that lowered demand for proppant, we believe that demand for proppant will continue to grow over the long-term, primarily driven by the increase in the average amount of proppant consumed per horizontal rig and as a result of the following demand drivers:

• | improvements in drilling rig productivity (from, among other things, pad drilling), resulting in more wells drilled per rig per year;


• | increases in the number of wells drilled per acre;


• | increases in the length of the typical horizontal wellbore;


• | increases in the number of fracture stages per foot in the typical completed horizontal wellbore;


• | increases in the volume of proppant used per fracturing stage; and


• | recurring efforts to offset steep production declines in unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs, including the drilling of new wells and secondary hydraulic fracturing of existing wells.

9

Furthermore, recent growth in demand for raw frac sand has outpaced growth in demand for other types of proppants, and industry analysts predict that this trend will continue. As well completion costs have increased as a proportion of total well costs, operators have increasingly looked for ways to improve per well economics by lowering costs without sacrificing production performance. To this end, over the last few years, the oil and natural gas industry has been shifting increasingly away from the use of higher-cost proppants, such as ceramics or resin coated sand, and more towards more cost-effective proppants, such as raw frac sand. 
Supply Trends
As demand for raw frac sand increased dramatically through 2014, the supply of raw frac sand failed to keep pace, resulting in a supply-demand disparity. As a result, a number of existing and new competitors announced supply expansions and greenfield projects. However, there are several key geological, operational and economic constraints to increasing raw frac sand production on an industry-wide basis, including:

• | the difficulty of finding frac sand reserves that meet API specifications;


• | the difficulty of securing contiguous frac sand reserves large enough to justify the capital investment required to develop a processing facility;


• | the challenges of identifying frac sand reserves with the above characteristics that either are located in close proximity to oil and natural gas reservoirs or have rail access needed for low-cost transportation to major shale basins;


• | the hurdles of securing mining, production, water, air, refuse and other federal, state and local operating permits from the proper authorities;


• | local opposition to development of facilities, especially those that require the use of on-road transportation, including hours of operations and noise level restrictions, in addition to moratoria on raw frac sand facilities in multiple counties in Wisconsin and other states which hold potential sand reserves; and


• | the typically long lead time required to design and construct sand processing facilities that can efficiently process large quantities of high quality frac sand.

Many announced expansions or greenfield projects were significantly delayed or canceled as a result of the decline in oil and natural gas exploration and production activity that took place in 2015 and throughout most of 2016. In addition, several existing facilities were temporarily or permanently idled.
Commencing production at facilities previously idled can require significant maintenance costs, use of working capital to build sufficient wet sand inventory for processing and hiring of employees if previously laid off. As a result, we do not believe many idled facilities will re-enter the market until frac sand pricing has reached a sustained and higher level to incentivize the investment.
Pricing
Spot market prices for frac sand have declined dramatically from the levels experienced in 2014, as sand producers, particularly those with excess inventories, substantially discounted sand pricing in order to sell product in a lower demand environment. Pricing continued its decline throughout 2015 and continued in 2016, but began to stabilize in the third quarter of 2016 and increase in the fourth quarter of 2016, although remaining near historically low levels. While the outlook for pricing of raw frac sand in 2017 is uncertain, given the expectation for increased oil and natural gas exploration and production activity in North America, coupled with the increased demand per well, and the limitations to increase sand supply noted above, frac sand pricing has risen in the first quarter of 2017 and is likely to be more favorable in 2017.
There are numerous grades and sizes of proppant which sell at various prices, dependent primarily upon the delivery point, and also quality, grade of proppant, deliverability and many other factors.  Pricing of proppant sold at the terminal is higher than pricing of proppant sold FOB plant as a result of the associated transportation and handling costs to bring the sand from the mine to the terminal. No reliable publicized pricing information for raw sand exists. However, it is believed that the overall pricing trends tend to be consistent across the various sizes and within regions with some variation due to transportation costs, resulting from distance from the source. We believe a significant amount of proppant is sold under long-term contracts with varying pricing mechanisms, with the remainder being sold under short-term pricing arrangements.
Customers and Contracts
Our current customer base includes some of North America’s largest providers of pressure pumping services or their subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales to each of Halliburton Company ("Halliburton"), Liberty Oilfield Services ("Liberty"), U.S. Well Services, LLC ("US Well") and Weatherford International Ltd. ("Weatherford") accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenues. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Weatherford made the decision to idle its U.S. pressure pumping business. As of February 10, 2017, the contractual relationship with Weatherford remains in place.
10

We sell the majority of the frac sand we produce to customers with whom we have long-term contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated 84% of our revenues from sales of frac sand to customers with whom we had long-term contracts. We expect to continue selling a majority of our sand to our customers with long-term contracts in 2017 and future years. As of January 1, 2017, our long-term contracts have an average remaining contractual term of 2.9 years and with remaining terms ranging from 8 to 55 months. 
The terms of our customer contracts, including sand quality requirements, quantity parameters, permitted sources of supply, effects of future regulatory changes, force majeure and termination and assignment provisions, vary by customer. Our contracts contain penalties for non-performance by our customers. If one of our customers fails to meet its minimum obligations to us, make-whole payments, combined with the decrease in our variable costs (such as production costs, royalty payments and transportation costs), can mitigate the adverse impact on our cash flow from such failures. In addition, we have the ability to sell these sand volumes to third parties. 
In 2015, as a result of the market dynamics existing during the year and continuing in 2016, we began providing market-based pricing to our contract customers and/or waivers of minimum volume purchase requirements, in certain circumstances in exchange for, among other things, additional term and/or volume. We continue to engage in discussions and may continue to deliver sand at prices or at volumes below those provided for in our existing contracts. In addition, our customers may fail to comply with the terms of their existing contracts. Our enforcement of specific contract terms may be limited by market dynamics and other factors. In December 2015, we received a settlement payment of $22.5 million for past and future obligations under a customer contract; $10.2 million of this settlement was recognized as revenue related to make-whole payments. 
Our long-term customer contracts also contain penalties for our non-performance. If we are unable to deliver contracted volumes within three months of contract year end, or otherwise arrange for delivery from a third party, we are required to pay make-whole payments. We believe our production facilities, substantial reserves and our on-site processing and logistics capabilities reduce our risk of non-performance. We also have the ability to supply our customers from facilities owned by our sponsor and third party facilities. We believe our levels of inventory combined with our cure period, generally three months after contract year end, are sufficient to prevent us from paying make-whole payments as a result of plant shutdowns due to repairs to our facilities necessitated by reasonably foreseeable mechanical interruptions.
In addition to sales under our long-term contracts, we have sold raw frac sand under short-term pricing and other agreements. The terms of our short-term pricing agreements, including sand quality requirements, quantity parameters, permitted sources of supply, effects of future regulatory changes, force majeure and termination and assignment provisions, vary by customer.
Suppliers 
Although the majority of the frac sand that we sell is produced from our or our sponsor's production facilities, we can purchase, and have purchased in the past, a certain amount of frac sand from various third parties for sale to our customers. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Partnership purchased 413,781, 1,603,875 and 781,478 tons, respectively, from our sponsor's Whitehall facility and other third parties.  
Production Operations 
Excavation Operations
The surface excavation operations at our production facilities are conducted by a third-party contractor. The mining technique at our production facilities is open-pit excavation of approximately 20-acre panels of unconsolidated silica deposits. The excavation process involves clearing vegetation and trees overlying the proposed mining area, with limited blasting processes conducted at our Augusta and Blair facilities and our sponsor's Whitehall facility. The initial two to five feet of overburden is removed and utilized to construct perimeter berms around the pit and property boundary. No underground mines are operated at our production facilities.
A track excavator and articulated trucks are utilized for excavating the sand at several different elevation levels of the active pit. The pit is dry mined, and the water elevation is maintained below working level through a dewatering and pumping process. The mined material is loaded and hauled from different areas of the pit and different elevations within the pit to the primary loading facility at our mines' on-site wet processing facilities. We pay a fixed fee per ton of sand excavated, subject to a diesel fuel surcharge.
At our Wyeville facility, in addition to surface excavation, sand is also mined through dredging operations.  Silica deposits are extracted from the ground with water.  The resulting slurry is transported via pipeline to the wet processing facility. Similar to surface excavation operations, the dredging at our Wyeville facility is performed by a third party contractor.  
Processing Facilities 
Our processing facilities are designed to wash, sort, dry and store our raw frac sand, with each plant employing modern and efficient wet and dry processing technology.
11

Our mined raw frac sand is initially stockpiled before processing. The material is recovered by a mounted belt feeder, which extends beneath a surge pile and is fed onto a conveyor. The sand exits the tunnel on the conveyor belt and is fed into the wet plant where impurities and unusable fine grain sand are removed from the raw feed. The wet processed sand is then stockpiled in advance of being fed into the dry plant for further processing. The wet plants operate for seven to eight months per year due to the limitations arising from sustained freezing temperatures during winter months. However, when the wet plants are operating they process more sand per day than the dry plants can process to build up stockpiles of frac sand that will be processed by the dry plants during the winter months.
The wet processed sand stockpile is fed into the dry plant hopper using a front end loader. The material is processed in a natural gas fired vibratory fluid bed dryer contained in an enclosed building. After drying, the sand is screened through gyratory screens and separated into industry standard product sizes. The finished product is then conveyed to multiple on-site storage silos for each size specification and our railcar loads are tested to ensure that the delivery meets API specifications. Oil and gas producers increasingly require current testing and proof that frac sand used in their drilling and completion processes meet API specifications.
Logistics Capabilities 
All of the product sold from our Wyeville and Augusta facilities is shipped by rail from approximately 32,000 feet and 28,800 feet, respectively, of track that connects our facilities to a Union Pacific Railroad mainline. All of the product sold from our Blair facility and our sponsor's Whitehall facility is shipped by rail from approximately 43,000 feet and 30,000 feet, respectively, of track that connects our facility to a Canadian National Railroad mainline. These rail spurs, size of the rail yards and the capacity of the associated product storage silos allow us to accommodate a large number of rail cars, including unit trains, which significantly increases our efficiency in meeting our customers’ frac sand transportation needs. We believe our production facilities are some of the first frac sand facilities in the industry initially designed to accommodate large scale rail and unit train logistics, which requires sufficient acreage, loading facilities and rail spurs.
Logistics capabilities of frac sand producers are important to our customers, who focus on both the reliability and flexibility of product delivery. Because our customers generally find it impractical to store frac sand in large quantities near their job sites, they seek to arrange for product to be delivered where and as needed, which requires predictable and efficient loading and shipping of product. The integrated nature of our logistics operations and our multiple rail spurs enable us to handle railcars for multiple customers simultaneously, minimizing the number of days required to successfully load shipments, even at times of peak activity, and avoid the use of trucks and minimize transloading within the facilities. At the same time, we believe our ability to ship from all of our facilities using unit trains differentiates us from most other frac sand producers that ship using manifest, or mixed freight, trains, which may make multiple stops to switch cars before delivering cargoes, or transport their products by truck or barge. In addition, unlike some competitors, our processing and rail loading facilities are located on-site, which eliminates the requirement for on-road transportation, lowers product movement costs and minimizes any reduction of sand quality due to increased handling. Together, these advantages provide our customers with a reliable and efficient delivery method from our facility to each of the major U.S. oil and natural gas producing basins, and allow us to take advantage of the increasing demand for such a delivery method.
Terminal Operations
We generally operate our terminal locations under long-term lease agreements with third party operators or short-line rail companies. Some of these lease agreements include performance requirements, which typically specify a minimum number of rail cars that must be processed by us each year through the terminal. Each owned or operated terminal location is strategically positioned in the shale plays so that our customers typically do not need to travel more than 75 miles from the well site to purchase their frac sand requirements. Our terminals include rail-to-truck and, at silo storage locations, rail-to-storage capabilities.
Once the frac sand is loaded into rail cars at the origin, we utilize an extensive network through a combination of Class I and short-line railroads to move the sand to our terminals. For our terminals with silo storage capabilities, frac sand is loaded into delivery trucks directly from our silos. Our silos deploy sand via gravity at 10 tons per minute to trucks stationed directly on scales under each silo with the loading, electronic recording of weight and dispatch of the truck capable of being completed in less than five minutes. Silos are considerably more efficient than conveyors, which require trucks to be loaded and then moved to separate scales to be weighed; however, frac sand can also be unloaded to delivery trucks directly via a conveyor. 
PropStream Operations
Our PropStream integrated logistics solution involves loading proppant at in-basin terminals into PropX containers before being transported by truck. The 8-foot cubic containers can each transport up to 33,000 pounds of proppant and, depending on Department of Transportation regulations, allow for the transport of up to 55,000 pounds per truck.  The containers utilize intermodal container chassis or standard flatbeds for transportation, resulting in significant savings both in terms of up-front and ongoing operations costs versus widely-used pneumatic equipment.  PropStream allows for increased transportation efficiency and a reduction in supply chain related congestion at well sites, lowering the number of trucks required per job and meaningfully reducing or eliminating demurrage costs.
12

At the well site, the PropBeast conveyor system significantly reduces noise and dust emissions due to its enclosed environment.  PropBeast conveyors are capable of transferring up to approximately 60,000 pounds of proppant per minute into blender hoppers while reducing particulate matter emissions from sand operations at the well site by more than 90% versus the widely-used pneumatic equipment alternative. Our PropStream integrated logistics solution is designed to provide a viable solution to meet the new OSHA respirable crystalline silica standards set to become effective in 2018 with respect to hydraulic fracturing, as well as the engineering control obligations set to become effective in 2021 for hydraulic fracturing.
Competition
There are numerous large and small producers in all sand producing regions of the United States with which we compete. Our main competitors include:

• | U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SLCA) 


• | Unimin Corporation


• | Fairmount Santrol Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: FMSA)


• | Badger Mining Corporation


• | Emerge Energy Services LP (NYSE: EMES)


• | Smart Sand, Inc. (NASDAQ: SND)

The most important factors on which we compete are price, reliability of supply, transportation capabilities, product quality, performance and sand characteristics. Demand for frac sand and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our products are closely linked to proppant consumption patterns for the completion of oil and natural gas wells in North America. These consumption patterns are influenced by numerous factors, including the price for hydrocarbons, the drilling rig count and hydraulic fracturing activity, including the number of stages completed and the amount of proppant used per stage. Further, these consumption patterns are also influenced by the location, quality, price and availability of proppant.
Our History and Relationship with Our Sponsor
Overview and History
Hi-Crush Proppants LLC, our sponsor, was formed in 2010 in Houston, Texas by members of our management team and board of directors, whom currently have a 39% membership interest. Our sponsor’s lead investor is Avista Capital Partners ("Avista"), a leading private equity firm with significant investing and operating expertise in the energy industry. Founded in 2005 by senior investment professionals who worked together at DLJ Merchant Banking Partners (“DLJMB”), then one of the world’s largest and most successful private equity franchises, Avista makes controlling or influential minority investments in connection with various transaction structures. The energy team at Avista is comprised of experienced professionals and industry executives with relevant expertise in the energy sector. Avista principals have led over $3.5 billion in equity investments in energy companies while at Avista and DLJMB, including Basic Energy Services, Inc., Brigham Exploration Company, Copano Energy, L.L.C., Seabulk International, Inc., and joint-ventures with Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc.
Our Sponsor’s Assets 
Our sponsor initially developed and constructed the Wyeville, Augusta and Blair facilities prior to their contribution or sale to the Partnership. The sponsor currently owns the Whitehall facility, completed in September 2014 and the remaining 2% interest in Augusta. As a result of market conditions, the Whitehall facility was temporarily idled during the second quarter of 2016 and is expected to resume operations in late March or early April 2017.
Our sponsor continually evaluates acquisitions and may elect to acquire, construct or dispose of assets in the future, including through sales of assets to us. As the owner of our general partner, 20,693,643 common units, and incentive distribution rights, our sponsor is well aligned and highly motivated to promote and support the successful execution of our business strategies, including utilizing our partnership as a growth vehicle for its sand mining operations. Although we expect to have the opportunity to make additional acquisitions directly from our sponsor in the future, including the Whitehall facility described above, our sponsor is under no obligation to accept any offer we make, and may, following good faith negotiations with us, sell the assets to third parties that may compete with us. Our sponsor may also elect to develop, retain and operate properties in competition with us.
Although we believe our relationship with our sponsor is a significant positive attribute, it may also be a source of conflict. For example, our sponsor is not restricted in its ability to compete with us. Since the commencement of operations at its Whitehall facility in 2014, however, our sponsor has not been competing directly with us for new and existing customers; instead, our sponsor has sold sand at favorable pricing from its Whitehall facility to us for sale by us to our customers under our long-term contracts and in the spot market. Our sponsor may develop additional frac sand excavation and processing facilities in the future, which may compete with us. While we expect that our management team, which also manages our sponsor’s retained assets, and our sponsor will allocate new and existing customer contract volumes between us and our sponsor in a manner that balances the interests of both parties, they are under no obligation to do so.

Our Management and Employees
We are managed and operated by the board of directors and executive officers of our general partner, Hi-Crush GP LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of our sponsor. As a result of owning our general partner, our sponsor has the right to appoint all members of the board of directors of our general partner, including at least three independent directors meeting the independence standards established by the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). Our unitholders are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors or otherwise directly participate in our management or operations. Even if our unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they have limited ability to remove the general partner without its consent, because our general partner and its affiliates own a sufficient number of units. Our unitholders are able to indirectly participate in our management and operations only to the limited extent actions taken by our general partner require the approval of a percentage of our unitholders and our general partner and its affiliates do not own sufficient units to guarantee such approval.
We have entered into a services agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of our sponsor which governs our relationship with our sponsor and its subsidiaries regarding the provisions of certain administrative services to us. In addition, under our partnership agreement, we reimburse our general partner and its affiliates, including our sponsor, for all expenses they incur and payments they make on our behalf, to the extent such expenses are not contemplated by the services agreement. Our partnership agreement does not set a limit on the amount of expenses for which our general partner and its affiliates may be reimbursed. Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner will determine in good faith the expenses that are allocable to us.
Hi-Crush Partners LP does not have any employees. All of the employees who conduct our business pursuant to the services agreement are employed by Hi-Crush Proppants LLC or its wholly owned subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2016, Hi-Crush Proppants LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries had 288 employees. In addition, we contract our excavation operations to a third party and accordingly have no employees involved in those operations.
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulation
Mining and Workplace Safety
Federal Regulation
The U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) is the primary regulatory agency with jurisdiction over the commercial silica industry. Accordingly, MSHA regulates quarries, surface mines, underground mines, and the industrial mineral processing facilities associated with quarries and mines. As part of MSHA’s oversight, its representatives must perform at least two unannounced inspections annually for each surface mining facility in its jurisdiction. To date, these inspections have not resulted in any citations for material violations of MSHA standards.
We also are subject to the requirements of the OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities, and the public. OSHA regulates the users of commercial silica and provides detailed regulations requiring employers to protect employees from overexposure to silica through the enforcement of permissible exposure limits and the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard.
Health and Safety Programs
We adhere to a strict occupational health program aimed at controlling employee exposure to silica dust, which includes a silicosis prevention program comprised of routine dust sampling, medical surveillance, training, and other components. Our safety program is designed to ensure compliance with MSHA and OSHA regulations. For both health and safety issues, extensive training is provided to employees. We have safety meetings at our plants with salaried and hourly employees that are involved in establishing, implementing and improving safety standards. We perform annual internal health and safety audits and conduct annual crisis management drills to test our abilities to respond to various situations. Health and safety programs are administered by our corporate health and safety department with the assistance of plant Environmental, Health and Safety Coordinators.
Environmental Matters
We and the commercial silica industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation pertaining to matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, hazardous materials, air and water emissions, and environmental contamination and reclamation. A variety of federal, state and local agencies have established, implement and enforce these regulations.
14

Federal Regulation
At the federal level, we may be required to obtain permits under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands and streams, in connection with our operations. We also may be required to obtain permits under Section 402 of the Clean Water Act from the EPA or the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ("Wisconsin DNR"), to whom the EPA has delegated local implementation of the permit program, for discharges of pollutants into waters of the United States, including discharges of wastewater or stormwater runoff associated with construction activities. Failure to obtain these required permits or to comply with their terms could subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief.
The U.S. Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. These regulatory programs may require us to install expensive emissions abatement equipment, modify operational practices, and obtain permits for existing or new operations. Before commencing construction on a new or modified source of air emissions, such laws may require us to reduce emissions at existing facilities. As a result, we may be required to incur increased capital and operating costs to comply with these regulations. We could be subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the U.S. Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations.
As part of our operations, we utilize or store petroleum products and other substances such as diesel fuel, lubricating oils and hydraulic fluid. We are subject to regulatory programs pertaining to the storage, use, transportation and disposal of these substances. Spills or releases may occur in the course of our operations, and we could incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including claims for damage or injury to property and persons. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA,” also known as the Superfund law) and comparable state laws may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed of or arranged for disposal, including offsite disposal, of a hazardous substance generated or released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
In addition, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. The EPA and Wisconsin DNR, to which the EPA has delegated portions of the RCRA program for local implementation, administer the RCRA program.
Our operations may also be subject to broad environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of all “major federal actions”, which could include a major development project, such as a mining operation, significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, our projects may require review and evaluation under NEPA. As part of this evaluation, the federal agency considers a broad array of environmental impacts, including, among other things, impacts on air quality, water quality, wildlife (including threatened and endangered species), historic and archaeological resources, geology, socioeconomics and aesthetics. NEPA also requires the consideration of alternatives to the project. The NEPA review process, especially the preparation of a full environmental impact statement, can be time consuming and expensive. Though NEPA requires only that an environmental evaluation be conducted and does not mandate a particular result, a federal agency could decide to deny a permit or impose certain conditions on its approval, based on its environmental review under NEPA, or a third party could challenge the adequacy of a NEPA review and thereby delay the issuance of a federal permit or approval.
Federal agencies granting permits for our operations also must consider impacts to endangered and threatened species and their habitat under the Endangered Species Act. We also must comply with and are subject to liability under the Endangered Species Act, which prohibits and imposes stringent penalties for the harming of endangered or threatened species and their habitat. Federal agencies also must consider a project’s impacts on historic or archaeological resources under the National Historic Preservation Act, and we may be required to conduct archaeological surveys of project sites and to avoid or preserve historical areas or artifacts.
15

State and Local Regulation
We are also subject to a variety of state and local environmental review and permitting requirements. Some states, including Wisconsin where our production facilities are located, have state laws similar to NEPA; thus our development of a new site or the expansion of an existing site may be subject to comprehensive state environmental reviews even if it is not subject to NEPA. In some cases, the state environmental review may be more stringent than the federal review. Our operations may require state-law based permits in addition to federal permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project’s impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations, and scenic areas. Wisconsin and some other states also have specific permitting and review processes for commercial silica mining operations, and state agencies may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. The development of new sites and our existing operations also are subject to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building, and transportation requirements.
Certain local communities in which we operate have developed or are in the process of developing regulations or zoning restrictions intended to minimize the potential for dust to become airborne, control the flow of truck traffic, significantly restrict the area available for mining activities and require compensation to local residents for potential impacts of mining, among other regulatory initiatives. In addition, our existing permits granted by local regulatory authorities contain certain restrictions on such matters as hours of operation, permitted decibel levels and lighting, among other matters.
The regulatory framework in the jurisdictions in which we do business is potentially subject to amendments or modifications. Planned expansion of our existing facilities as well as the development of new facilities could be significantly impacted by increased regulatory activity. Delays or inability to obtain required permits for expansion of existing facilities, or the development of new facilities, as well as the increased costs of compliance with future state and local regulatory requirements could have a material negative impact on our ability to grow our business. In an effort to minimize these risks, we continue to be engaged with local communities in order to grow and maintain strong relationships with residents and regulators.
Costs of Compliance
We may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health, and safety requirements applicable to our activities. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; imposition of investigatory, cleanup, and site restoration costs and liens; the denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations; and the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also increase the cost of the development, construction, and operation of our projects and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given project. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property may result from environmental and other impacts of our activities.
The process for performing environmental impact studies and reviews for federal, state, and local permits required for our operations involves a significant investment of time and monetary resources. We cannot control the permit approval process. We cannot predict whether all permits required for a given project will be granted or whether such permits will be the subject of significant opposition. The denial of a permit essential to a project or the imposition of conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impair or prevent our ability to develop a project. Significant opposition and delay in the environmental review and permitting process also could impair or delay our ability to develop a project. Additionally, the passage of more stringent environmental laws could impair our ability to develop new operations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Permits
Production Facilities
We operate our and our sponsor's facilities under a number of federal, state and local authorizations.
Our production facilities currently operate under construction and operation air permits from the Wisconsin DNR. Each production facility operates under an operation air permit, with the exception of Wyeville; at our Wyeville facility, we have complied with the construction air permit and have requested an operational air permit from the Wisconsin DNR. All production facilities, have developed and are in compliance with a Fugitive Dust Control Plan and a Malfunction Prevention and Abatement Plan.
Stormwater discharges from our production facilities are permitted under the Wisconsin Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“WPDES”) administered by Wisconsin DNR; and, at our Augusta facility, also under the Eau Claire County Storm Water Management and Erosion Control ordinance. An updated Notice of Intent for the WPDES general construction permit, which would include modifications to the existing storm water management and erosion control structures for an expansion at any production facility is submitted to and approved by the Wisconsin DNR. All production facilities are currently covered by WPDES general construction permits for various projects.
Our production facilities have federal and state certifications and/or permits for the filling and/or taking of wetlands associated with our construction and/or operational activities.
16

Our mining operations are subject to the conditions of nonmetallic mining permits granted and administered by either the County or City in which we operate. We submit updated nonmetallic mining plans to the relevant regulatory authority as may be required in the event of a proposed expansion of any mining operation.
We utilize groundwater through the installation and operation of high capacity wells, located at our Augusta and Blair facilities. High capacity well permits are issued and administered by the WDNR and are subject to annual (or monthly) withdraw limitations. We routinely monitor our water withdrawals, and also utilize a water recycling system to return production water and/or stormwater to minimize the water we need from those high capacity groundwater wells.
Terminal Facilities
We operate our terminal facilities under various federal, state and local authorizations.  Although the list of permits we obtain in order to commence and maintain our operations at each facility vary by location, we are typically required to obtain, among other permits and authorizations, air, land development, local building and highway occupancy permits.  We are also occasionally required to obtain a wetlands permit.
