We believe that the scale, scope and quality of our outsourced services are unparalleled in our industry. The relative operating cost efficiency of our current 747-8F, 747-400F and 777-200LRF aircraft, including their superior fuel efficiency, range, capacity and loading capabilities, creates a compelling value proposition for our customers and positions us well in the markets we operate. Our growing fleet of 767-300 and 737-400 freighter aircraft are well-suited for regional and domestic applications. 
 We are focused on the further enhancement of our market-leading ACMI and CMI services. We are currently the only operator offering 747-8F and 777 aircraft under ACMI and CMI agreements, and we have the flexibility to expand our fleet in response to market conditions. We believe that our current fleet, which also includes our 747-400F aircraft, represents one of the most efficient, reliable freighter fleets in the market. Our primary placement for the 747-8F and 747-400F aircraft will continue to be long-term ACMI outsourcing contracts with high-credit-quality customers. 
 During 2016, we significantly expanded our CMI and Dry Leasing services. In April 2016, the acquisition of Southern Air provided us with immediate entry into the 777 and 737 aircraft operating platforms, with ten aircraft and the potential for developing additional business with existing and new customers. In May 2016, we entered into agreements with Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiary, Amazon Fulfillment Services, Inc., (collectively Amazon), which involve, among other things, the leasing and operation of 20 Boeing 767-300 freighter aircraft. The first two aircraft were placed in service in August 2016 and February 2017, and the remainder are expected to be placed in service by the end of 2018. In addition to the contracts above, our Dry Leasing business includes six 777 freighters that are Dry Leased to customers on a long-term basis. Our Dry Leasing portfolio diversifies our business mix and enhances our predictable, long-term revenue and earnings streams. 
 AAWW was incorporated in Delaware in 2000. Our principal executive offices are located at 2000 Westchester Avenue, Purchase, New York 10577, and our telephone number is (914) 701-8000.
Operations 
 Introduction.  Our business is organized into three operating segments based on our service offerings: ACMI, Charter and Dry Leasing. All segments are directly or indirectly engaged in the business of air transportation services but have different commercial and economic characteristics. Each operating segment is separately reviewed by our chief operating decision maker to assess operating results and make resource allocation decisions. Additional information regarding our reportable segments can be found in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Report (the Financial Statements). 
 ACMI.  The core of our business is generally providing cargo aircraft outsourcing services to customers on an ACMI and CMI basis, in exchange for guaranteed minimum revenues at predetermined levels of operation for defined periods of time. ACMI and CMI contracts provide a predictable annual revenue and cost base by minimizing the risk of fluctuations such as price, fuel and demand risk in the air cargo business. Our revenues and most of our costs under ACMI and CMI contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, minimizing currency risks associated with international business. 
 All of our ACMI and CMI contracts provide that the aircraft remain under our exclusive operating control, possession and direction at all times. These contracts further provide that both the contracts and the routes to be operated may be subject to prior and periodic approvals of the U.S. or foreign governments. Revenue from ACMI and CMI contracts is typically recognized as the Block Hours are operated on behalf of a customer during a given month, as defined contractually. If a customer flies below a minimum contracted Block Hour guarantee, the contracted minimum revenue amounts are recognized as revenue. The original length of these contracts generally ranges from two to seven years, although we do offer contracts of shorter or longer duration. In addition, we have also operated short-term ACMI cargo and passenger services and we expect to continue to provide such services.

As a percentage of our operating revenue, ACMI segment revenue represented 45.4% in 2016, 43.4% in 2015 and 43.2% in 2014. As a percentage of our operated Block Hours, ACMI represented 72.2% in 2016, 70.9% in 2015 and 71.4% in 2014. 
 Charter.  Our Charter business primarily provides full planeload cargo and passenger aircraft to customers, including the AMC, brokers, freight forwarders, direct shippers, airlines, sports teams and fans, and private charter customers. Charters are for one or more flights based on a specific origin and destination. Atlas also provides limited airport-to-airport cargo services to select markets, including several cities in South America. In addition, we occasionally earn revenue on subcontracted Charter flights. Atlas typically bears all direct operating costs for both cargo and passenger charters, which include fuel, insurance, landing and navigation fees, and most other operational fees and costs. 
 As a percentage of our operating revenue, Charter segment revenue, which includes fuel and other operational costs, represented 47.9% in 2016, 49.9% in 2015 and 50.4% in 2014. As a percentage of our operated Block Hours, Charter represented 27.0% in 2016, 28.2% in 2015 and 27.7% in 2014. 
 Dry Leasing.  Our Dry Leasing business provides aircraft and engines to customers, including some CMI customers, for compensation that is typically based on a fixed monthly amount (a Dry Lease). This business is primarily operated by Titan, which is principally a cargo aircraft dry lessor, but also owns and manages aviation assets such as passenger narrow-body aircraft, engines and related equipment. Titan also markets its expertise in asset management, passenger-to-freighter conversion and other aviation-related technical services. As a percentage of our operating revenue, Dry Leasing segment revenue represented 5.8% in 2016, 5.9% in 2015 and 5.6% in 2014. 
 Other Revenue.  As a percentage of our operating revenue, Other revenue, which includes administrative and management support services and flight simulator training, represented 0.9% in 2016, 0.8% in 2015 and 0.8% in 2014. 
 DHL Investment and Polar 
 DHL Network Operations (USA), Inc. (DHL) holds a 49% equity interest and a 25% voting interest in Polar (see Note 3 to our Financial Statements). AAWW owns the remaining 51% equity interest and 75% voting interest. Under a 20-year blocked space agreement that expires in 2027 (the BSA), Polar provides air cargo capacity to DHL. Atlas and Polar also have a flight services agreement, whereby Atlas is compensated by Polar on a per Block Hour basis, subject to a monthly minimum Block Hour guarantee, at a predetermined rate with the opportunity for performance premiums that escalate annually. Under the flight services agreement, Atlas provides Polar with crew, maintenance and insurance for the aircraft. Under separate agreements, Atlas and Polar supply administrative, sales and ground support services to one another. Deutsche Post AG (DP) has guaranteed DHLs (and Polars) obligations under the various agreements described above. AAWW has agreed to indemnify DHL for and against various obligations of Polar and its affiliates. Collectively, these agreements are referred to in this Report as the DHL Agreements. The DHL Agreements provide us with a minimum guaranteed annual revenue stream from aircraft that have been dedicated to Polar for DHL and other customers freight over the life of the agreements. DHL provides financial support and also assumes the risks and rewards of the operations of Polar. 
 
4 
 
Combined with Polar, we provide ACMI, CMI, Charter and Dry Leasing services to support DHLs transpacific express, North American and intra-Asian networks. In addition, we fly between the Asia Pacific region, the Middle East and Europe on behalf of DHL and other customers. Atlas also provides incremental charter capacity to Polar and DHL on an ad hoc basis. The following table summarizes the aircraft types and services provided to DHL as of December 31, 2016: 
 

Aircraft Type | Service | | Total
747-8F | | ACMI | | 6 
747-400F | | ACMI | | 7 
777-200LRF | | CMI | | 5 
767-300 | | CMI and Dry Leasing | | 4 
767-200 | | CMI | | 9 
737-400F | | CMI | | 5 
757-200F | | Dry Leasing | | 1 
Total | | | | 37

Amazon 
 In May 2016, we entered into certain agreements with Amazon, which involve, among other things, CMI operation of 20 Boeing 767-300 freighter aircraft for Amazon by Atlas, as well as Dry Leasing by Titan. The Dry Leases will have a term of ten years, while the CMI operations will be for seven years (with an option for Amazon to extend the term to ten years). The first two aircraft were placed in service in August 2016 and February 2017, and the remainder are expected to be placed in service by the end of 2018. 
 In conjunction with these agreements, we granted Amazon a warrant providing the right to acquire up to 20% of our outstanding common shares, after giving effect to the issuance of shares pursuant to the warrants, at an exercise price of $37.50 per share. A portion of the warrant, representing the right to purchase 3.75 million shares, vested immediately upon issuance of the warrant and the remainder of the warrant, representing the right to purchase 3.75 million shares, will vest in increments of 375,000 as the lease and operation of each of the 11th through 20th aircraft commences. The warrant will be exercisable in accordance with its terms through 2021. As of December 31, 2016, no warrants have been exercised. 
 The agreements also provide incentives for future growth of the relationship as Amazon may increase its business with us. In that regard, we granted Amazon a warrant to acquire up to an additional 10% of our outstanding common shares, after giving effect to the issuance of shares pursuant to the warrants, for an exercise price of $37.50 per share. This warrant to purchase 3.75 million shares will vest in conjunction with payments by Amazon for additional business with us. The warrant will be exercisable in accordance with its terms through 2023. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We have regional sales offices in various locations around the world that cover the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, Africa and Middle East regions. These offices market our ACMI, CMI and Dry Leasing services to express delivery providers, e-commerce retailers, airlines and freight forwarders. They also market our cargo and passenger Charter services to charter brokers, the U.S. military, freight forwarders, direct shippers and airlines. 
Fuel 
 Historically, aircraft fuel is one of the most significant expenses for us. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, fuel costs represented 16.5%, 19.6%, and 24.9%, respectively, of our total operating expenses. Fuel prices and 
 
5 
 
 availability are subject to wide price fluctuations based on geopolitical issues, supply and demand, which we can neither control nor accurately predict. The following table summarizes our total fuel consumption and costs: 
 

 | 2016 | | 2015 | | | 2014
Gallons consumed (in thousands) | | 163,862 | | | 147,081 | | | 131,787
Average price per gallon, including tax | $ | 1.68 | | $ | 2.27 | | $ | 3.07 
Cost (in thousands) | $ | 275,113 | | $ | 333,390 | | $ | 404,263

 Our exposure to fluctuations in fuel price is limited to the commercial portion of our Charter business only. The ACMI segment has no direct fuel price exposure because ACMI and CMI contracts require our customers to pay for aircraft fuel. Similarly, we generally have no fuel price risk for AMC charters because the price is set under our contract with the AMC, and we receive or make payments to adjust for price increases and decreases from the contractual rate. 
 In the past, we have not experienced significant difficulties with respect to fuel availability. Although we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in the availability of aircraft fuel, a number of factors, such as geopolitical uncertainties in oil-producing nations and shortages of and disruptions to refining capacity or transportation of aircraft fuel from refining facilities, make accurate predictions unreliable. For example, hostilities and political turmoil in oil-producing nations could lead to disruptions in oil production and/or to substantially increased oil prices. Any inability to obtain aircraft fuel at competitive prices would materially and adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. 
 Employees 
 Our business depends on highly qualified management, operations and flight personnel. As a percentage of our consolidated operating expenses, salaries, wages and benefits accounted for approximately 25.4% in 2016, 20.7% in 2015 and 19.2% in 2014. As of December 31, 2016, we had 2,646 employees, 1,581 of whom were pilots. We maintain a comprehensive training program for our pilots in compliance with U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements, in which each pilot regularly attends recurrent training programs. 
 Pilots of Atlas and Southern Air, and flight dispatchers of Atlas and Polar are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the IBT). These employees represented approximately 60.5% of our workforce as of December 31, 2016. We have a five-year collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with our Atlas pilots, which became amendable in September 2016; and a four-year CBA with the Southern Air pilots, which became amendable in November 2016. We also have a five-year CBA with our Atlas and Polar dispatchers, which becomes amendable in November 2017. 
 After we completed the acquisition of Southern Air in April 2016, we informed the IBT of our intention to pursue (and we have been pursuing) a complete operational merger of Atlas and Southern Air. Pursuant to the merger provisions in both the Atlas and Southern Air CBAs, joint negotiations for a single CBA for Atlas and Southern Air should commence promptly. Once a seniority list is presented to us by the unions, it triggers an agreed-upon time frame to negotiate a new joint CBA with any unresolved issues submitted to binding arbitration. After the merger process began, the IBT filed an application for mediation with the National Mediation Board (NMB) on behalf of the Atlas pilots. We have opposed the mediation application as it is not in accordance with the merger provisions in the parties existing CBAs, which have a defined and streamlined process for negotiating a joint CBA when a merger occurs, as in the case with the Atlas and Southern Air merger. The NMB conducted a pre-mediation investigation in June 2016, which is currently pending. Due to a lack of meaningful progress in such discussions, in February 2017, we filed a lawsuit against the IBT to compel arbitration on the issue of whether the merger provisions in Atlas and Southern Airs CBAs apply to the bargaining process. 
 We are subject to risks of work interruption or stoppage as permitted by the Railway Labor Act of 1926 (the Railway Labor Act) and incur additional administrative expenses associated with union representation of our employees. 
 
6 
 
Maintenance 
 Maintenance represented our third-largest operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. Primary maintenance activities include scheduled and unscheduled work on airframes and engines. Scheduled maintenance activities encompass those activities specified in our maintenance program approved by the FAA. The costs necessary to adhere to these maintenance programs may increase over time, based on the age of the equipment or due to FAA airworthiness directives (ADs). 
 Under the ADs issued pursuant to the FAAs Aging Aircraft Program, we are subject to extensive aircraft examinations and may be required to undertake structural modifications to our fleet from time to time to address any problems of corrosion and structural fatigue. The FAA has issued increased inspection and maintenance requirements depending on aircraft type and ADs requiring certain additional aircraft modifications. We believe all aircraft in our fleet are in compliance with all existing ADs. It is possible, however, that additional ADs applicable to the types of aircraft or engines included in our fleet could be issued in the future and that the cost of complying with such ADs could be substantial. 
 Under our FAA-approved maintenance programs, all Heavy Maintenance is currently performed by third-party service providers that are compensated on a time-and-material basis as we believe they provide the most reliable and efficient means of maintaining our aircraft fleet. 
 Insurance 
 We maintain insurance of the types and in amounts deemed adequate and consistent with current industry standards. Principal coverage includes: liability for injury to members of the public, including passengers; injury to crewmembers and ground staff; damage to our property and that of others; and loss of, or damage to, flight equipment, whether on the ground or in flight. 
 Aviation insurance premiums historically have fluctuated based on factors that include the loss history of the industry in general and the insured carrier in particular. Terrorist attacks and other adverse events involving aircraft could result in increases in insurance costs and could affect the price and availability of such coverage. We participate in an insurance pooling arrangement with DHL and its partners. This allows us to obtain aviation hull and liability, war-risk hull and cargo loss, crew, third-party liability insurance and hull deductible coverage at reduced rates from the commercial insurance providers. If we are no longer included in this arrangement for any reason or if pool members have coverage incidents, we may incur higher insurance costs. 
Governmental Regulation 
 General.  Atlas, Polar and Southern Air (the Airlines) are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (the DOT) and the FAA, among other U.S. and foreign government agencies. The DOT primarily regulates economic issues affecting air service, such as certification, fitness and citizenship, competitive practices, insurance and consumer protection. The DOT has the authority to investigate and institute proceedings to enforce its economic regulations and may assess civil penalties, revoke operating authority or seek criminal sanctions. The Airlines hold DOT-issued certificates of public convenience and necessity plus exemption authority to engage in scheduled air transportation of property and mail in domestic, as well as enumerated international markets, and charter air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis. Atlas additionally holds worldwide passenger charter authority. 
 The DOT conducts periodic evaluations of each air carriers fitness and citizenship. In the area of fitness, the DOT seeks to ensure that a carrier has the managerial competence, compliance disposition and financial resources needed to conduct the operations for which it has been certificated. Additionally, each U.S. air carrier must remain a U.S. citizen by (i) being organized under the laws of the United States or a state, territory or possession thereof; (ii) requiring its president and at least two-thirds of its directors and other managing officers 
 
7 
 
 to be U.S. citizens; (iii) allowing no more than 25% of its voting stock to be owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by foreign nationals; and (iv) not being otherwise subject to foreign control. The DOT broadly interprets control to exist when an individual or entity has the potential to exert substantial influence over airline decisions through affirmative action or the threatened withholding of consents and/or approvals. We believe the DOT will continue to find the Airlines fitness and citizenship favorable. 
 In addition, the Airlines are required to hold valid FAA-issued air carrier certificates and FAA-approved operations specifications authorizing operation in specific regions with specified equipment under specific conditions and are subject to extensive FAA regulation and oversight. The FAA is the U.S. government agency primarily responsible for regulation of flight operations and, in particular, matters affecting air safety, such as airworthiness requirements for aircraft, operating procedures, mandatory equipment and the licensing of pilots, mechanics and dispatchers. The FAA monitors compliance with maintenance, flight operations and safety regulations and performs frequent spot inspections of aircraft, employees and records. The FAA also has the authority to issue ADs and maintenance directives and other mandatory orders relating to, among other things, inspection of aircraft and engines, fire retardant and smoke detection devices, increased security precautions, collision and windshear avoidance systems, noise abatement and the mandatory removal and replacement of aircraft parts that have failed or may fail in the future. In addition, the FAA mandates certain record-keeping procedures. The FAA has the authority to modify, temporarily suspend or permanently revoke an air carriers authority to provide air transportation or that of its licensed personnel, after providing notice and a hearing, for failure to comply with FAA rules, regulations and directives. The FAA is empowered to assess civil penalties for such failures or institute proceedings for the imposition and collection of monetary fines for the violation of certain FAA regulations and directives. The FAA is also empowered to modify, suspend or revoke an air carriers authority on an emergency basis, without providing notice and a hearing, where significant safety issues are involved. 
 In December 2011, the FAA adopted a rule to impose new flight and duty time requirements with the stated goal of reducing pilot fatigue. The rule took effect on January 14, 2014. The rule applies to Atlas passenger operations but not to the Airlines all-cargo operations. The Independent Pilots Association, representing the pilots of United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS), filed a judicial appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit challenging the FAA decision not to include all-cargo operations in the rule. On March 24, 2016, the Court issued an order denying the appeal. Should the FAA decide either on its own initiative or pursuant to Congressional directive to change the final rule to include all-cargo operations, it could result in a material increase in crew costs for the Airlines. It could also have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition by limiting crew scheduling flexibility and increasing operating costs, especially with respect to long-range flights. 
 International.  Air transportation in international markets (the vast majority of markets in which the Airlines operate) is subject to extensive additional regulation. The ability of the Airlines to operate in other countries is governed by aviation agreements between the United States and the respective countries (in the case of Europe, the European Union (the EU)) or, in the absence of such an agreement, by principles of reciprocity. Sometimes, aviation agreements restrict the number of Airlines that may operate, their frequency of operation, or the routes over which they may fly. This makes it necessary for the DOT to award route and operating rights to U.S. air carrier applicants through competitive route proceedings. International aviation agreements are periodically subject to renegotiation, and changes in U.S. or foreign governments could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of existing route authorities or otherwise affect Atlas and Polars international operations. Foreign government authorities also impose substantial licensing and business registration requirements and, in some cases, require the advance filing and/or approval of schedules or rates. Moreover, the DOT and foreign government agencies typically regulate alliances and other commercial arrangements between U.S. and foreign air carriers, such as the ACMI and CMI arrangements that Atlas maintains. Approval of these arrangements is not guaranteed and may be conditional. In addition, approval during one time period does not guarantee approval in future periods. 
 
8 
 
A foreign governments regulation of its own air carriers can also affect our business. For instance, the EU places limits on the ability of EU carriers to use ACMI aircraft operated by airlines of non-EU member states. The regulations have a negative impact on our ACMI business opportunities. 
 Airport Access.  The ability of the Airlines to operate suitable schedules is dependent on their ability to gain access to airports of their choice at commercially desirable times and on acceptable terms. In some cases, this is constrained by the need for the assignment of takeoff and landing slots or comparable operational rights. Like other air carriers, the Airlines are subject to such constraints at slot-restricted airports in cities such as Chicago and a variety of foreign locations (e.g., Tokyo, Shanghai and Incheon). The availability of slots is not assured and the inability of the Airlines or their ACMI carrier customers to obtain additional slots could inhibit efforts to provide expanded services in certain international markets. In addition, nighttime flight restrictions have been imposed or proposed by various airports in Europe, Canada and the U.S. Depending on their severity, these could have an adverse operational impact. 
 Access to the New York airspace presents an additional challenge. Because of congestion in the New York area, especially at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), the FAA imposes hourly limits on JFK operations of those carriers offering scheduled services and potentially could place limits on Charter flights. 
 As a further means to address congestion, the FAA allows U.S. airports to raise landing fees to defray the costs of airfield facilities under construction or reconstruction. Any landing fee increases implemented would have an impact on airlines generally. 
 Security.  The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) extensively regulates aviation security through rules, regulations and security directives that are designed to prevent unauthorized access to passenger and freighter aircraft and the introduction of prohibited items including firearms and explosives onto an aircraft. Atlas and Polar currently operate pursuant to a TSA-approved risk-based security program that, we believe, adequately maintains the security of all aircraft in the fleet. We utilize the TSA, the intelligence community and the private sector as sources for our aggressive threat-based risk-management program. There can be no assurance, however, that we will remain in compliance with existing or any additional security requirements imposed by TSA or by U.S. Congress without incurring substantial costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations. To mitigate any such increase, we are working closely with the Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies to ensure that a risk-based management approach is utilized to target specific at-risk cargo. This approach will limit any exposure to regulation that would require 100% screening of all cargo at an excessive cost. Additionally, foreign governments and regulatory bodies (such as the European Commission) impose their own aviation security requirements and have increasingly tightened such requirements. This may have an adverse impact on our operations, especially to the extent the new requirements may necessitate redundant or costly measures or be in conflict with TSA requirements. We have successfully implemented all European Commission security programs allowing us unimpeded access to European markets. 
 Environmental.  We are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment, including the discharge or disposal of materials and chemicals and the regulation of aircraft noise, which are administered by numerous state, local and federal agencies. For instance, the DOT and the FAA have authority under the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 and under the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 to monitor and regulate aircraft engine noise. We believe that all aircraft in our fleet materially comply with current DOT, FAA and international noise standards. 
 We are also subject to the regulations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) regarding air quality in the United States. All of our aircraft meet or exceed applicable EPA fuel venting requirements and smoke emissions standards. 
 There is significant U.S. and international government interest in implementing measures to respond to the problem of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. Various governments, including the United States, are pursuing measures to regulate climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.

In October 2013, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) reached a nonbinding agreement to address climate change by developing global market-based measures to assist in achieving a carbon-neutral growth from 2020 onward. In October 2016, ICAO approved a resolution to adopt a global market-based measure known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which is designed to offset any annual increases in total carbon emissions from international civil aviation above a baseline level determined by the average of 2019 and 2020 emissions. Although various details regarding the implementation of CORSIA still need to be finalized, a pilot phase will run from 2021 to 2023 and, starting in 2019, the airlines of participating countries will begin monitoring and reporting fuel burn during international flights. As a result, for each year starting in 2021, covered airlines may need to purchase allowances to offset their assigned share of emissions overages. 
 Additionally, the EU continues to pursue a parallel track to address climate change through its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Following the end of every year, to the extent the ETS applies, each airline must tender the number of carbon emissions allowances (Allowances) corresponding to carbon emissions generated by its covered flight activity during the year. If the airlines flight activity during the year has produced carbon emissions exceeding the number of Allowances that it has been awarded, the airline must acquire Allowances from other airlines in the open market. In recognition of ICAOs recent adoption of CORSIA, the ETS was suspended with respect to international aviation through December 31, 2016; however, measures continue to remain applicable to intra-EU aviation. Although certain EU political leaders have stated that the EU is likely to extend the suspension applicable to flights to and from the EU beyond December 31, 2016, we cannot be certain whether or for how long the EU will do so. 
 In the United States, various constituencies have continued to advocate for controls on greenhouse gas emissions. Previously, both houses of the U.S. Congress passed legislation to impose a carbon-related tax on fuel sold to airlines and other entities. However, a bill has not been signed into law. Also, on August 15, 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule finding that greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare. That finding could lead to EPA regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft. 
 Other Regulations.  Air carriers are also subject to certain provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 because of their extensive use of radio and other communication facilities and are required to obtain an aeronautical radio license from the Federal Communications Commission. Additionally, we are subject to U.S. and foreign antitrust requirements and international trade restrictions imposed by U.S. presidential determination and U.S. government agency regulation, including the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. We endeavor to comply with such requirements at all times. We are also subject to state and local laws and regulations at locations where we operate and at airports that we serve. Our operations may become subject to additional international, U.S. federal, state and local requirements in the future. 
 We believe that we are in material compliance with all currently applicable laws and regulations. 
 Civil Reserve Air Fleet.  As part of our Charter business, Atlas and Polar both participate in the U.S. Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) Program, which permits the U.S. Department of Defense to utilize participants aircraft during national emergencies when the need for military airlift exceeds the capability of military aircraft. Participation in the CRAF Program could adversely restrict our commercial business in times of national emergency. Under the CRAF Program, contracts with the AMC typically cover a one-year period. We have made a substantial number of our aircraft available for use by the U.S. military in support of their operations and we operate such flights pursuant to cost-based contracts. Atlas bears all direct operating costs for both passenger and cargo aircraft, which include fuel, insurance, overfly, landing and ground handling expenses. The contracted charter rates (per mile) and fuel prices (per gallon) are fixed by the AMC periodically. We receive reimbursements from the AMC each month if the price of fuel paid by us to vendors for the AMC Charter flights exceeds the fixed price. If the price of fuel paid by us is less than the fixed price, then we pay the difference to the AMC.

Airlines may participate in the CRAF Program either alone or through a teaming arrangement. We are a member of the team led by FedEx Corporation (FedEx). We pay a commission to the FedEx team, based on the revenues we receive under our AMC contracts. The AMC buys cargo capacity on two bases: a fixed basis, which is awarded both annually and quarterly, and expansion flying, which is awarded on an as-needed basis throughout the contract term. While the fixed business is predictable, Block Hour levels for expansion flying are difficult to predict and thus are subject to fluctuation. 
 Future Regulation.  The U.S. Congress, the DOT, the FAA, the TSA and other government agencies are currently considering, and in the future may consider, adopting new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, our operations, ownership and profitability. It is impossible to predict what other matters might be considered in the future and to judge what impact, if any, the implementation of any future proposals or changes might have on our businesses. 
 Competition 
 The market for ACMI and CMI services is competitive. We believe that the most important basis for competition in this market is the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the aircraft assets and the scale, scope and quality of the outsourced operating services provided. Atlas is currently the only provider of ACMI and CMI services with the modern 747-8F and 777 aircraft. The primary ACMI and CMI providers for 747-400 and 767 aircraft include the following: Atlas; Air Atlanta Icelandic; Air Transport Services Group, Inc.; Kalitta Air, LLC; and Western Global Airlines. 
 The Charter market is competitive, with a number of cargo operators that include AirBridge Cargo Airlines; Cargolux; Kalitta Air, LLC; National Air Cargo; and passenger airlines providing similar services utilizing 747-8Fs, 747-400s and 747-200s. We believe that we offer a superior long-haul aircraft in the 747-8F and 747-400, and we will continue to develop new opportunities in the Charter market for aircraft not otherwise deployed in our ACMI business. 
 The Dry Leasing business is also competitive. We believe that we have an advantage over other cargo aircraft lessors in this business as a result of our relationships in the cargo market and our insights and expertise as an operator of aircraft. Titan also competes in the passenger aircraft leasing market to develop key customer relationships, enter strategic geographic markets, and/or acquire feedstock aircraft for future freighter conversion. Our primary competitors in the aircraft leasing market include GE Capital Aviation Services; AWAS; Guggenheim Aviation Partners, LLC; Aviation Capital Group Corp.; Aircastle Ltd.; AerCap Holdings N.V.; Air Transport Services Group, Inc.; and Fly Leasing, among many others.
