ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Overview
 
We are a Florida corporation formed on April 8, 2001. We were originally organized to be a blank check company.
 
On May 17, 2011, the Company entered into an exclusive memorandum of understanding with Immunovative Clinical Research, Inc. (“ICRI”), a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Immunovative Therapies, Ltd. (“ITL”), an Israeli corporation pursuant to which the Company and ICRI intended to pursue a merger resulting in Novo owning ICRI.
 
In April 2012, the Board of Directors approved the change of name to “Immunovative, Inc.” As described in a report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 30, 2012, a majority of shareholders executed a written consent in lieu of an Annual Meeting effecting the change of the name of our business from “Novo Energies Corporation” to “Immunovative, Inc.” on April 2, 2012 to better reflect what we then intended to be our future operations. We filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation on April 30, 2012 with the Florida Secretary of State to affect this name change after receiving the requisite corporate approval.
 
On February 19, 2013, the Company and ITL entered into a settlement agreement whereby the parties agreed to the following: (1) the Company will submit a letter to the Court advising the Court that the parties have reached a settlement and that the Company is withdrawing its motion, (2) ITL will pay the Company $20,000, (3) ITL will issue to the Company, ITL’s share capital equivalent to 9% of the issued and outstanding shares of ITL, (4) the Company will change its name and (5) the settling parties agree that the license agreement will be terminated. The Company had valued these shares at $0 since they deemed the investment to be worthless. During the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company sold the 3,280,000 shares for $125,000 which was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the relevant period.
 
On March 13, 2013, the Board of Directors approved the change of name to “Tauriga Sciences, Inc.” from “Immunovative, Inc.” We filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation on March 13, 2013 with the Florida Secretary of State to affect this name change after receiving the requisite corporate approval. The Company’s stock symbol change to “TAUG” was approved by FINRA effective April 9, 2013.
 
Cupuaçu Butter Lip Balm
 
On December 23, 2016, the Company entered into a non-exclusive, 12-month license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Cleveland, Ohio based cosmetics products firm Ice + Jam LLC (“Ice + Jam”). Under terms of the License Agreement, the Company will market Ice + Jam’s proprietary cupuaçu butter lip balm, sold under the trademark HERMAN® and the two companies will evenly share on a 50/50 basis any profits generated through the Company’s marketing, sales and distribution efforts. The Company had agreed to pay the production, marketing and start-up costs for all product it sells to retail customers or distributors. As part of the License Agreement, the Company issued 5,000,000 common shares which had a value of $27,500, based on the closing price of the stock on the day the Company entered into the agreement ($0.005 per share). The cost of the shares will be prorated over the life of the license.
 
On November 27, 2017, the Company announced a 2-year extension to the existing non-exclusive License Agreement, extending the life of the License Agreement through December 23, 2019, at which time, if mutually agreed upon, the companies reserve the option to extend for an additional 2 years (if exercised at that time, this License Agreement would be extended through December 23, 2021). The two companies reserve the right to request amendment of the License Agreement at any point during the effective term of the agreement.
 
During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company launched this lip balm product (branded as HerMan®) . The Company is hopeful that that this product can provide the Company with sustainable revenue at margins that will justify the initial expense and effort. The Company believes that the initial high cost per unit of this lip balm product was largely attributable to formulation issues that have since been addressed and resolved, packing issues, fulfillment issues and shipping costs. The Company believes that future inventory costs, if there is sufficient demand, will be substantially lower than the first batch on a per unit basis. The Company is exercising caution and performing due diligence to ensure that any potential opportunities in this area are appropriately evaluated.
 
During February of 2018, the Company’s strategy with respect to the HerMan product was negatively impacted by a series of product defects relating to the twisting mechanism of the lip balm tube. The Company immediately made the decision to work with the manufacturer to permanently address and fix this defect issue (which the Company believes has affected approximately 30% of the initial product batch. This issue significantly increases the risk associated with this business opportunity and there can be no guarantee that this will be satisfactorily solved.
 
The Company recognized sales of the HERMAN® product in the year ended March 31, 2018 in the aggregate amount of $1,118; however, due to the above described tube mechanism issue, the Company has removed the product from the website until such time as it is satisfied that the manufacturer has resolved product quality issues. As a result of the initial manufacturing quality control issues regarding the packaging, the Company has written off the remaining inventory of $16,897 as the re-design of the packaging of this product is completed. The manufacturing defect relates to the turning mechanism of the tube and not the lip balm formulation in and of itself.

Honeywood
 
On March 10, 2014, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire California-based Honeywood LLC (“Honeywood”), developer of a topical medicinal cannabis product, that, at the time, sold in numerous dispensaries across the state of California. This definitive agreement was valid for a period of 120 days and the Company advanced to Honeywood $217,000 to be applied towards the final closing requisite cash total and incurred $178,000 in legal fees as of March 31, 2014 in connection with the acquisition.
 
On September 24, 2014 (the “Unwinding Date”), the Company, Honeywood and each of Honeywood’s principals entered into a Termination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) to unwind the effects of the Merger (the “Unwinding Transaction”). In accordance with the Termination Agreement, Honeywood agreed to repay to the Company substantially all of the advances made by the Company to Honeywood prior to and after the Merger by delivering to the Company on the Unwinding Date a Secured Promissory Note in the principal amount of $170,000 (the “Note”). The Note bore interest at 6% per annum and was repayable in six quarterly installments on the last day of each calendar quarter starting on March 31, 2015 and ending on June 30, 2016. The Note was secured by a blanket security interest in Honeywood’s assets pursuant to a Security Agreement entered into on the Unwinding Date between Honeywood and the Company. Honeywood never made any payments under the Note prior to the Honeywood Conversion Agreement (as defined below). As a result, the Company had fully reserved this amount and it was not reflected as a receivable on its financial statements.
 
Effective August 1, 2017, the Company entered into a Debt Conversion Agreement, whereby the Company agreed to convert the entire principal and accrued but unpaid interest due into a 5% membership interest in Honeywood (the “Honeywood Conversion Agreement”).
 
The Company made an assessment for impairment of its investment in Honeywood at the entity level. During the relationship between the Company and Honeywood, Honeywood had a working capital deficiency and had a history of operating losses. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320-10-35-28, “Investments—Debt and Equity Securities”, a Company may not record an impairment loss on the investment but shall continue to evaluate whether the investment is impaired (that is, shall estimate the fair value of the investment) in each subsequent reporting period until either of the following occurs: a) the investment experiences a recovery of fair value up to (or beyond) its cost; or b) the entity recognizes an other-than-temporary impairment loss. At the time of the Honeywood Conversion Agreement, the receivable balance under the Note of $199,119 had been fully written off by the Company in a prior period. As a result of the Honeywood Conversion Agreement, the Company deemed the investment to still have no current value. The Company recorded this investment at $0. Thus, no recovery of bad debt and no impairment will be recognized in this period.
 
Pilus Energy
 
On November 25, 2013, the Company executed a definitive merger agreement to acquire Pilus Energy, LLC (“Pilus”), an Ohio limited liability company and a developer of alternative cleantech energy platforms using proprietary microbial solutions that create electricity while consuming polluting molecules from wastewater. On January 28, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of Pilus. As a condition of the acquisition, the shareholders of Pilus received a warrant to purchase 100,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company, which represented a fair market value of approximately $2,000,000, and, based upon whether the Warrants issued to Pilus represented at least 5% the then outstanding and fully diluted capitalization of the Company, Pilus had been granted an option to appoint a member to the Company’s board of directors. No board member had been appointed by Pilus to the Company’s board. In addition, the Company paid Open Therapeutics, LLC (f/k/a Bacterial Robotics, LLC and Microbial Robots, LLC) (“Open Therapeutics”), formerly the parent company of Pilus, $50,000 on signing the merger agreement and $50,000 at the time of closing. Pilus’ principal asset on its balance sheet at the time of the acquisition was its U.S. patent relating to its cleanwater technology. The Company determined that the value of the acquisition on January 28, 2014 would be equal to the value of cash paid to Pilus plus the value of the 100,000,000 warrants the Company issued to acquire Pilus. Through March 31, 2014, the Company amortized the patent over its estimated useful life, then on March 31, 2014, the Company conducted its annual impairment test and determined that the entire unamortized balance should be impaired as the necessary funding to further develop the patent was not available at that time.

On December 22, 2016, the Company entered in a membership interest transfer agreement with Open Therapeutics whereby the Company sold 80% of its membership interest in Pilus back to Open Therapeutics. Open Therapeutics agreed to terminate and cancel 80% of the unexercised portion of the warrant to purchase 28,917,647 shares (or 23,134,118 warrants) of the Company’s common stock. Open Therapeutics agreed to pay to the Company 20% of the net profit generated Pilus Energy from its previous year’s earnings, if any. The first $75,000 of such payments would be retained by Pilus Energy as additional consideration for the sale, which is reflected as a contingent liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company further agreed it would vote its 20% membership interest in Pilus Energy in the same manner that Open Therapeutics votes its membership interest on all matters for which a member vote is required. Through March 31, 2018, there has been no activity recorded by Open Therapeutics with respect to Pilus Energy, and thus the $75,000 remains contingently owed to them.
 
ColluMauxil
 
On November 15, 2016, the Company announced that it would form a new wholly-owned subsidiary focused on the development, marketing and distribution of products that target muscle tension. The subsidiary was to be called ColluMauxil Therapeutics LLC (“ColluMauxil”), which is based on the Latin terms for neck relief - “collum” and “auxilium.” The Company filed for trademarks in respect of this business with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company planned to develop, market, distribute and potentially license a broad array of products and technologies that would help individuals affected by muscle tension. Due to financial constraints and changing regulations, the Company decided to discontinue this business plan entirely and has allowed all trademarks obtained in relation to ColluMauxil to expire. This business segment is no longer in existence.
 
Tauriga Biz Dev Corp
 
On January 4, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors unanimously approved the formation a wholly-owned subsidiary focused on acquiring interest(s) in patents and other intellectual property. This subsidiary, incorporated in Delaware, was named Tauriga IP Acquisition Corp. The Company has committed to funding the subsidiary with up to $300,000 from its available cash. On March 25, 2018, the Company changed the name to Tauriga Biz Dev Corp.
 
On March 29, 2018 the Company, through Tauriga Biz Dev Corp., entered into an independent sales representative agreement with Blink Charging Company (NASDAQ: BLN K) (“BLINK”). Under this agreement the Company will be a non-exclusive independent sales representative. The Company will act on behalf of BLINK to solicit orders from potential customers for EV (“Electric Vehicle”) Stations placement. Tauriga Biz Dev Corp will be compensated upon contracting and as long as the Company’s acquired prospect remains under contract. This arrangement has the potential to earn both short term as well as long term recurring revenue by helping BLINK expand its national electric vehicle charging infrastructure and network. This sales agreement is a three-tier model based on whether Tauriga contracts the new customer to purchase equipment outright from Blink or enter into one of two revenue-sharing agreements. In the case Tauriga effectuates a sale of Blink equipment it will receive a one-time sales commission based on the sales price of the equipment sale. In the case where Tauriga secures a revenue sharing agreement with a customer where Blink remains the owner, Tauriga will be paid an on-going commission based off of gross charger revenue, subject to which party paid for the installation. Commission payments under the revenue sharing agreement are subject to minimum revenue generation hurdles.
 
Moving forward, the Company remains interested in consummating an acquisition or other strategic transaction to bolster its operations during the next fiscal year, if possible; however, we cannot express with any certainty that an acquisition or other strategic transaction will be sourced or consummated in the next fiscal year. If an acquisition or other strategic transaction is sourced and approved by the board of directors, the Company will, in addition to conducting appropriate due diligence on such target, evaluate its options in terms of its cost and payment approach to any such transaction, including the utilization of available cash, equity or a mixture of both to consummate such transaction.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
Common Stock Issuances
 
Subsequent to March 31, 2018, the Company issued 9,750,000 shares of its restricted common stock to consultants under consulting agreements and 148,931,506 shares of restricted common stock to a noteholder for the conversion of debt and accrued interest having a value of $57,339 ($0.0004 per share).
 
On March 12, 2018, the Board of Directors approved moving forward with a reverse stock split which could be implemented at the discretion of the Board of Directors at any time over a period of six months from the date of approval. On April 24, 2018, the Board of Directors voted to implement this previously approved 1 for 75 reverse stock split for the Company’s common stock. There will be a commensurate adjustment to the Company’s authorized shares (which will be reduced from its current figure of 7,500,000,000 to the post-split figure of 100,000,000).  The Company believes that this reverse split will be effective during July 2018, and will file a current report on Form 8-K to announce the specific effective date and other relevant information once completed.
 
Convertible Notes
 
On April 25, 2018 GS Capital Partners, LLC canceled the back-end note dated October 17, 2017. In accordance with Section 8(n) of the original note, the note may be cancelled if the Company trades less than $40,000 in any consecutive 5-day period. From April 9 -13, 2018, the stock traded less than $17,000.
 
On May 10, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with GS Capital Partners, LLC. GS Capital Partners, LLC whereby the Company issued two 8% convertible redeemable notes in the cumulative principal amount of $56,000. The first 8% note for $28,000 was funded with net proceeds of $25,000, after the deduction of $3,000 for OID. The second 8% note (the “Back-End Note”) is initially paid for by an offsetting promissory note issued by GS Capital Partners, LLC to the Company (the “Note Receivable”). The terms of the Back-End Note require cash funding prior to any conversion thereunder. The Note Receivable is due January 10, 2019, unless certain conditions are not met, in which case both the Back-End Note and the Note Receivable may both be cancelled. Both the First Note and the Back-End Note have a maturity date one year from the date of issuance upon which any outstanding principal and interest is due and payable. The amounts cash funded plus accrued interest under both the First Note and the Back-End Note are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a price for each share of common stock equal to 70% of the lowest daily VWAP of the common stock as reported on the National Quotations Bureau OTC Markets market on which the Company’s shares are traded or any exchange upon which the common stock may be traded in the future, for the 15 prior trading days including the day upon which a notice of conversion is received by the Company or its transfer agent. In the event the Company experiences a DTC “chill” on its shares, the conversion price shall be decreased to 60% instead of 70% while that “chill” is in effect. The Back-End Note will not be cash funded and such note, along with the Note Receivable, will be immediately cancelled if the shares do not maintain a minimum trading price during the five days prior to such funding and a certain aggregate dollar trading volume during such period.
 
Upon an event of default, principal and accrued interest will become immediately due and payable under the notes. Additionally, upon an event of default, both notes will accrue interest at a default interest rate of 24% per annum or the highest rate of interest permitted by law. Further, certain events of default may trigger penalty and liquidated damage provisions. During the first six months First Note is in effect, the Company may redeem either note by paying to GS Capital Partners, LLC an amount as follows: (i) if the redemption is within the first 90 days either note is in effect, then for an amount equal to 120% of the unpaid principal amount of either note along with any interest that has accrued during that period, and (ii) if the redemption is after the 91st day the either note is in effect, but less than the 180th day, then for an amount equal to 133% of the unpaid principal amount of either note along with any accrued interest. The note may be redeemed after 180 days. The back-end note may not be repaid. The note holder may redeem this note at any time after the first six months.
