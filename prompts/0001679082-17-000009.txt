General 
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for women’s health and endocrine diseases. Our lead product candidate is relugolix, an oral, once-daily, small molecule that acts as a gonadotropin-releasing hormone, or GnRH, receptor antagonist. We are advancing relugolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, endometriosis-associated pain, and advanced prostate cancer. In addition, we are developing MVT-602, an oligopeptide kisspeptin agonist, for the treatment of female infertility as part of the hormonal preparation used in assisted reproduction. Both relugolix and MVT-602 are licensed to us by Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG, or Takeda. Our mission is to become the leading global pharmaceutical company focused on women’s health and endocrine diseases.
Relugolix
We are developing relugolix in three indications: heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, endometriosis-associated pain, and advanced prostate cancer. Relugolix is an oral, once-daily, small molecule that acts as a GnRH receptor antagonist that binds to and inhibits GnRH receptors in the anterior pituitary gland. Inhibition of GnRH receptors decreases the release of gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone), thereby decreasing the downstream production of estrogen and progesterone by the ovaries in women and testosterone by the testes in men. 
As a GnRH receptor antagonist, relugolix has a clinically-validated mechanism of action in each of our three target indications. Lowering estrogen levels decreases heavy menstrual bleeding in women with uterine fibroids and improves the pelvic pain associated with endometriosis. Decreasing testosterone slows the growth and progression of advanced prostate cancer and is the central objective of treatment once the disease has recurred following definitive treatment with prostatectomy or radiation therapy or in men presenting with advanced prostate cancer. Injectable GnRH agonists are currently approved to treat uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and prostate cancer, and an injectable GnRH antagonist is approved to treat men with prostate cancer.
In our clinical programs for our target women’s health indications, a maximally estrogen-suppressive dose of relugolix (40 mg) will be co-administered orally, once daily with low-dose estradiol and progestin add-back therapy, with the goal of minimizing side-effects typically associated with low estrogen levels (such as bone mineral density loss and hot flashes) while maximizing the benefit of low estrogen levels on symptoms of uterine fibroids and endometriosis. We intend to commercialize relugolix, if approved, in our target women’s health indications as a fixed-dose combination product, which is a once-daily single pill containing both relugolix and low-dose estradiol and progestin. The hormonal add-back therapy we intend to use consists of estradiol (1.0 mg) and norethindrone acetate, or NETA, (0.5 mg) and is a formulation currently approved for use to lower the side effect of bone mineral density loss and reduce vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) in postmenopausal women. We believe relugolix with low-dose hormonal add-back therapy has the potential to have a better safety and tolerability profile than the currently approved GnRH therapies and has the potential to be used longer-term. The goal of this longer-term treatment is to provide women with uterine fibroids and endometriosis a medical alternative to hysterectomy and other invasive procedures often recommended to treat these conditions. In our clinical program for men with prostate cancer, a maximally testosterone-suppressive dose of relugolix (120 mg) will be administered orally, once daily. We believe relugolix has a well-defined safety profile, based on its evaluation in more than 1,300 study participants to date, in Phase 1 and multiple large, randomized Phase 2 clinical trials, including at doses of 120 mg/day administered to men for more than one year.

Uterine Fibroids
Uterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors composed of smooth muscle and fibrous connective tissue that develop in or on the walls of the uterus. In addition to an individual’s genetic predisposition, estrogens are well known to play an important role in the regulation of fibroid growth. Although uterine fibroids are benign tumors that are often asymptomatic, they can cause debilitating symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, heavy or painful periods, anemia, abdominal pain, backache, increased abdominal girth and bloating, urinary frequency or retention, constipation or painful defecation, pregnancy loss, painful intercourse and, in some cases, infertility. These symptoms can also lead to loss of productivity at work, limitations in normal activities of daily living, and social embarrassment.
Uterine fibroids are among the most common reproductive tract tumors in women. We estimate approximately 5 million women in the United States suffer from symptoms of uterine fibroids, approximately 3 million of whom are inadequately treated by current medical therapy and require further treatment. 
The current approach to treating uterine fibroids includes both medical and surgical options. The recommended treatment for a given patient is dependent on factors such as the patient’s desire to become pregnant in the future, the importance of uterine preservation, symptom severity, and tumor characteristics. Medical options include oral contraceptives, tranexamic acid, and GnRH agonists. The current standard of care for the treatment of patients with mild symptoms includes the use of oral contraceptives or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, which are generally prescribed at the time of initial diagnosis. These therapeutic options, however, often do not provide sufficient relief to the many patients with more moderate-to-severe symptoms. These women require additional treatment to relieve excessive bleeding and pain. Tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent, is approved for use to treat heavy menstrual bleeding. GnRH agonists are used for short-term therapy and may involve low-dose estradiol and progestin hormonal add-back therapy to lower the side effect of bone mineral density loss and reduce vasomotor symptoms generally associated with GnRH agonists. Surgical intervention, such as myomectomy or hysterectomy, are often used to treat the heavy bleeding and symptoms associated with uterine fibroids; however, these procedures may result in post-operative complications, complications with future pregnancy, or even preclude the potential for future pregnancies. Even if a future pregnancy is not desired, many women prefer to avoid surgical intervention. However, heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids is a leading cause of hysterectomy, resulting in approximately 250,000 hysterectomies per year in the United States alone.

Our Phase 3 Program for Uterine Fibroids 
We are conducting a Phase 3 clinical program consisting of two international, replicate pivotal clinical trials (LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2), which we initiated in January 2017, for relugolix in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. Women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in the LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 trials are randomized to one of three arms using 1:1:1 randomization. Women receive treatment with relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with commercially available low-dose hormonal add-back therapy for 24 weeks, relugolix 40 mg once daily monotherapy for 12 weeks followed by relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with hormonal add-back therapy for an additional 12 weeks, or placebo once daily for a period of 24 weeks. We expect to enroll approximately 390 women in each of the two replicate LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 trials, with 130 women in each of the two active treatment arms and 130 women in the placebo arm. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 is the proportion of all women enrolled who achieve a menstrual blood loss volume of less than 80 mL and at least a 50% reduction in menstrual blood loss volume from baseline over the last month of treatment as measured by the alkaline hematin method, a quantitative measurement of menstrual blood loss. The secondary efficacy endpoints include measures of change from baseline in hemoglobin, assessment of the impact of therapy on quality-of-life measures, the reduction in uterine and fibroid volume, and pain reduction. Safety, including bone mineral density changes as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, is also being assessed. If the results of LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 are favorable, we intend to submit a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA in 2019. We will conduct a bridging study intended to support approval of the fixed-dose combination of relugolix with low-dose estradiol and progestin. Eligible women completing the LIBERTY 1 or LIBERTY 2 trial will be offered the opportunity to enroll in an active treatment extension study where all patients will receive relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with hormonal add-back therapy for an additional 28-week period, or a total treatment period of 52 weeks, to evaluate the safety of long-term treatment. We may conduct additional clinical trials to further support the commercial potential of relugolix in uterine fibroids in the United States and other major markets.
Takeda Phase 3 Clinical Development for Uterine Fibroids 
Takeda is currently conducting two Phase 3 trials for relugolix in Japan, one for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and one for the treatment of uterine fibroid-associated pain. The first trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind noninferiority study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of relugolix in 288 women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. Relugolix 40 mg once daily is administered for 24 weeks, compared with leuprolide administered by subcutaneous injection every four weeks at a dose of 1.88 mg or 3.75 mg. The primary endpoint is the proportion of women who receive a total score of less than 10 on the Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart, or PBAC, a patient-reported outcome measure for evaluation of menstrual blood loss in clinical trials, from week 6 to week 12, which was the same endpoint used in Takeda's Phase 2 trial in women with uterine fibroids. The second Phase 3 trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study evaluating relugolix 40 mg once daily for 12 weeks versus placebo in 64 women having at least moderate pain symptoms associated with uterine fibroids. The primary endpoint is the proportion of women with a maximum Numerical Rating Scale score, or score on a patient-reported assessment of pain, of one or less during the 28 days before the final dose of study drug at week 12.
Preliminary data from these trials are currently anticipated in the second half of 2017. These Phase 3 data will be available to us, and may be used to support our NDA. If Takeda’s Phase 3 program for heavy menstrual bleeding and uterine fibroid-related pain is successful, Takeda plans to seek regulatory approval of relugolix in Japan for these indications in 2018. We will be solely responsible for obtaining FDA approval for relugolix in the United States.
Endometriosis
Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue that normally lines the uterus is found outside the uterine cavity. Endometriosis lesions commonly appear in the lower abdomen or pelvis or on ovaries, the bladder, or the colon. During the menstrual cycle, the lesions grow, differentiate, and shed into the abdomen, thereby inducing a cascade of inflammatory events. The symptoms associated with endometriosis can include painful periods and chronic pelvic pain, painful ovulation, pain during or after sexual intercourse, heavy bleeding, fatigue, and even infertility. Endometriosis can also impact general physical, mental, and social well-being.
According to the Endometriosis Foundation, endometriosis affects an estimated 1-in-10 women during their reproductive years and, in the United States, can take an average of 10 years from the onset of symptoms to accurately diagnose, often leading to unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. We estimate that approximately 6 million women in the United States suffer from symptomatic endometriosis, 1.2 million of whom are inadequately treated by oral contraceptives and require additional treatment.
7

Similar to uterine fibroids, lowering estrogen levels has been shown to reduce pain associated with endometriosis, and there are a variety of medical and surgical treatments available. Initial treatment usually involves over-the-counter pain medications, including NSAIDs, because pain is the primary symptom. In more severe cases, GnRH agonists such as leuprolide are used for short-term treatment and may involve hormonal add-back therapy. The FDA has approved Lupaneta Pack, or leuprolide administered with NETA (5 mg), to treat pain associated with endometriosis while lowering the side effect of bone mineral density loss and reducing vasomotor symptoms. For many patients, surgical intervention, typically laparoscopy with ablation of endometriotic lesions, is ultimately undertaken to relieve pain. After treatment with hormonal therapy or laparoscopic procedures, recurrence of endometriosis and related symptoms is common, resulting in repeated procedures for many women. In addition, approximately 100,000 endometriosis-related hysterectomies are performed each year in the United States, although hysterectomy is not a cure for endometriosis and pain associated with endometriosis will not necessarily subside following hysterectomy.
Our Phase 3 Clinical Development Plan for Endometriosis 
We plan to initiate our Phase 3 clinical program consisting of two international, replicate pivotal clinical trials for relugolix in women with endometriosis-associated pain in the first half of 2017. Women with endometriosis-associated pain in these trials will be randomized to one of three arms using 1:1:1 randomization. Women will receive treatment with relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with low-dose hormonal add-back therapy for 24 weeks, relugolix 40 mg once daily monotherapy for 12 weeks followed by relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with hormonal add-back therapy for an additional 12 weeks, or placebo once daily for a period of 24 weeks. Each of the two replicate trials is expected to enroll approximately 600 women, with 200 women in each of the two active treatment arms and 200 women in the placebo arm. Eligible women completing the initial 24-week period will be offered an active treatment extension with relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with hormonal add-back therapy for an additional 28-week period, or a total treatment period of 52 weeks, to evaluate the safety of longer-term treatment. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints for these trials are the proportion of all women enrolled with reductions in both dysmenorrhea, or menstrual pelvic pain, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain, as assessed by an endometriosis-specific patient questionnaire administered daily, with no increase in background pain medication. Secondary endpoints will include additional questionnaires assessing functional changes associated with endometriosis-specific pain and quality of life, and the use of pain medications to treat endometriosis. Safety, including bone mineral density changes as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, will be assessed. If the results of these trials are favorable, we intend to submit an NDA to the FDA in 2019. If not already completed for the uterine fibroid indication, we will conduct a bridging study intended to support approval of the fixed-dose combination of relugolix with low-dose estradiol and progestin. We may conduct additional clinical trials to further support the commercial potential of relugolix in endometriosis in the United States and other major markets.
Advanced Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer is the second most prevalent form of cancer in men and the second leading cause of death due to cancer in men in the United States. According to the National Cancer Institute, approximately 2.9 million men are currently living with prostate cancer in the United States, and approximately 180,000 men are newly diagnosed each year. Men with prostate cancer are often asymptomatic at the earliest stages of disease and prostate cancer is generally understood to be slow to progress, leading to a median age at diagnosis of 66 years and a five-year survival rate of 98.9%. 
If prostate cancer is diagnosed at a stage where it is confined to the prostate gland and immediate surroundings, it is generally treated by surgical removal of the prostate gland, or prostatectomy, or with radiation. Often, these procedures are successful in curing men of their disease. Men whose disease progresses after prostatectomy or radiation are said to have advanced prostate cancer. Advanced prostate cancer is defined as any of the following: PSA biochemical relapse following primary surgical or radiation therapy of curative intent; newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer; or advanced localized disease for which immediate radiation or surgical therapy is not indicated. The cure rate following surgery, depending on the stage of the cancer, is about 70% overall and, following radiation, about 50% to 60%. Approximately 25% to 30% of men will, therefore, progress to advanced disease, excluding those with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. 
8

First-line treatment for advanced prostate cancer typically involves treatment with androgen deprivation therapies, or ADT, which are therapies that substantially reduce testosterone. This is because androgens, such as testosterone, promote the growth of cancerous prostate cells by binding to and activating the androgen receptor which, once activated, stimulates prostate cancer cell growth. ADT consisting of either medical castration or surgical castration, or removal of the testes which produce testosterone, can be successful in delaying prostate cancer progression. More than 80% of patients with advanced prostate cancer initially respond to ADT with varying degrees of tumor regression or stabilization. The duration and depth of response to ADT is presumably dependent on the underlying tumor biology and burden. Thus, patients with metastatic prostate cancer, or prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, respond for an average of two years before any biochemical evidence of castration resistance occurs. By contrast, patients with biochemical-only evidence of progressive disease may respond to ADT for five years or more. As prostate cancer progresses, men remain on ADT while other therapies are added, typically until death. 
The most commonly prescribed ADTs are GnRH agonists, such as long-acting leuprolide depot injections. GnRH agonists initially stimulate testosterone production, but with chronic stimulation of the GnRH receptors, the pituitary gland desensitizes and luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone decrease with a resultant reduction in testosterone three to four weeks after the initiation of therapy. The initial stimulation of testosterone can cause an initial worsening of symptoms, or clinical flare. GnRH agonists are often given as depot formulations, requiring injections every month, three months or six months, and testosterone remains suppressed for weeks and months after cessation of therapy. 
Our Phase 3 Clinical Development Plan for Advanced Prostate Cancer 
We are conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial, the HERO study, which we initiated in the first quarter of 2017, for relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer. We believe that the HERO study, if successful, will be sufficient to support the filing of an NDA based on an End-of-Phase 2 meeting held with the US FDA. The European Scientific Advice procedure and an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the Japanese health authority have also been completed supporting the design of the HERO study.
Our Phase 3 HERO trial in men with advanced prostate cancer who require ADT will randomize men to treatment with either oral relugolix 120 mg once daily (after a single oral loading dose of 360 mg) or a depot injection of leuprolide (per national or regional product label) for a period of at least 48 weeks. We will enroll approximately 1,125 men into this trial, with approximately 750 men enrolled into the active treatment arm and 375 men into the leuprolide arm using a 2:1 randomization scheme. Based on FDA discussions, we are only required to conduct one Phase 3 trial with a single relugolix arm to gain approval in the United States; however, we are including a leuprolide arm to gain approval in other major markets where the demonstration of noninferiority to leuprolide is required. 
The primary efficacy endpoint accepted by the FDA is testosterone suppression (≤ 50 ng/dL) from week 5, day 1 through week 48, day 7. Relugolix must demonstrate that the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the percent of patients achieving testosterone suppression through 48 weeks is at least 90%. The secondary efficacy endpoint is PSA reduction as a percentage change from baseline. Testosterone suppression is an approvable endpoint in the United States and several hormonal therapies have been approved based on this endpoint. If the results of this trial are favorable, we intend to submit an NDA to the FDA. We may conduct additional clinical trials to further support the commercial potential of relugolix in prostate cancer in the United States and other major markets.
MVT-602
As part of our license agreement with Takeda, we acquired the worldwide rights to MVT-602, our second product candidate, which has been evaluated in over 150 men. MVT-602 is an oligopeptide kisspeptin agonist. Kisspeptin is a naturally-occurring peptide that stimulates GnRH release and is required for puberty and maintenance of normal reproductive function, including production of sperm, follicular maturation and ovulation, and production of estrogen and progesterone in women and testosterone in men. We intend to complete a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study in women to be followed by the initiation of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in the second half of 2017 for MVT-602 for the treatment of female infertility in women as part of assisted reproduction, such as in vitro fertilization, or IVF. Approximately 1.5 million assisted reproduction cycles are performed each year worldwide. Further, approximately 25% of women suffering from infertility have problems achieving ovulation, including the inability to produce fully-matured eggs or the failure to ovulate, most commonly resulting from hormonal dysfunction in the GnRH-luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone axis. We believe MVT-602 has the potential to be a safer alternative to human chorionic gonadotropin as a part of assisted reproduction for the treatment of female infertility.
9

We believe that MVT-602, an analog of the naturally-occurring kisspeptin peptide in humans, may mimic natural physiology by inducing a luteinizing hormone surge during IVF and other assisted reproductive technologies, enhancing the likelihood of successful egg maturation and ovulation at the right time without the serious side effect of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, or OHSS. While assisted reproductive technologies are effective, typically resulting in pregnancy in 20% to 35% of patients, the standard procedure has remained largely unchanged since inception and has potentially serious side effects. The most serious side effect of assisted reproduction is OHSS. Severe OHSS has been reported to occur in up to 2% of the general assisted reproduction population, and in up to 20% of patients at high-risk for developing OHSS. OHSS is thought to occur as a result of the nonphysiologic elevations in luteinizing hormone that occur as a result of egg maturation triggered with human chorionic gonadotropin and to a lesser extent the GnRH receptor agonists.
By acting upstream in the GnRH-axis to promote the release of physiologically normal levels of key hormones in the assisted reproduction cycle such as luteinizing hormone, kisspeptin agonists, such as MVT-602, may have the potential to trigger egg maturation without causing OHSS. A recently published investigator-sponsored trial where a native kisspeptin peptide (specifically, kisspeptin 54) was used in place of human chorionic gonadotropin as the egg-maturation trigger in the assisted reproduction cycle showed that none of the 60 high-risk patients developed moderate-to-severe OHSS and resulted in a live birth rate of up to 65.1% at the maximally efficacious dose tested. These encouraging results validate the potential use of kisspeptin analogs as a safe alternative to the standard egg maturation trigger in assisted reproduction protocols. To our knowledge, MVT-602 is the only kisspeptin agonist in clinical development and thus has the potential to become a safe alternative egg-maturation trigger in this space.
Our Key Agreements
License Agreement with Takeda
In April 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Takeda, or the Takeda Agreement. Pursuant to the Takeda Agreement, Takeda granted to us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by Takeda to develop and commercialize relugolix and MVT-602, and products containing these compounds for all human diseases and conditions. The territory for our exclusive license for relugolix covers all countries worldwide, except that Takeda retains exclusive rights to Japan, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam (including, in each case, the territories and possession of each of the foregoing), which we collectively refer to as the Takeda Territory. Takeda has granted us a nonexclusive license in the Takeda Territory to manufacture relugolix and to conduct development of relugolix for prostate cancer, solely for commercialization in our territory. The territory for our exclusive license for MVT-602 covers all countries worldwide. Our license includes a right of reference to regulatory materials related to relugolix and MVT-602 controlled by Takeda.
Under the Takeda Agreement, we granted to Takeda an exclusive, royalty-bearing license in the Takeda Territory under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by us to develop and commercialize relugolix and products containing relugolix for all human diseases and conditions, subject to our nonexclusive rights to conduct development and manufacturing as described above. We also granted to Takeda a nonexclusive license in our territory to manufacture relugolix and MVT-602 and to conduct development of relugolix for uterine fibroids and endometriosis, in each case solely for commercialization in the Takeda Territory. Takeda’s license includes a right of reference to regulatory materials controlled by us. If Takeda determines not to seek regulatory approval for or to commercialize relugolix in any country in the Takeda Territory, then we have a right of first negotiation to acquire the rights to seek regulatory approval and commercialize relugolix in such country.
We are solely responsible, at our expense, for all activities related to the development of relugolix and MVT-602 in our territory and all activities related to the development of relugolix through the receipt of regulatory approval for prostate cancer in the Takeda Territory. Pursuant to the terms of the Takeda Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval of relugolix for the treatment, prevention, cure or control of symptoms associated with uterine fibroids or endometriosis and MVT-602 in our territory, as well as to develop and obtain regulatory approval of relugolix for prostate cancer in Japan and the United States. We are solely responsible, at our expense, for all activities related to the commercialization of relugolix and MVT-602 in our territory and must use commercially reasonable efforts to do so in each country in our territory in which we obtain regulatory approval. Takeda is solely responsible, at its expense, for all activities related to the commercialization of relugolix in the Takeda Territory, and must use diligent efforts to commercialize relugolix for prostate cancer in the Takeda Territory following receipt of regulatory approval.
10

We will pay Takeda a fixed, high single-digit royalty on net sales of relugolix and MVT-602 products in our territory, subject to certain agreed reductions. Takeda will pay us a royalty at the same rate as ours on net sales of relugolix products for prostate cancer in the Takeda Territory, subject to certain agreed reductions. Royalties are required to be paid, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest to occur of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of a licensed patent covering such product in such country, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country, or 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country. Under the Takeda Agreement, there was no upfront payment and there are no payments upon the achievement of clinical development or marketing approval milestones.
During the period commencing on the effective date of the Takeda Agreement and ending two years after the first commercial sale of product containing relugolix in a major market country, we and our controlling shareholder, Roivant Sciences Ltd., or RSL, have both agreed that we will not, directly or indirectly, and will cause all of our respective affiliates (other than any affiliate that is a public company) not to, alone or with others, research (or fund any research), develop, make, use, sell, offer for sale, or import any competing product in our territory or the Takeda Territory or enter into any agreement with any third party with respect to a license or other acquisition of rights relating to any competing product in our territory or the Takeda Territory. For these purposes, a competing product is (1) any small molecule oral GnRH receptor antagonist (other than a product containing relugolix) for uterine fibroids, endometriosis, or prostate cancer, and (2) any product containing MVT-602 for prostate cancer in the Takeda Territory. If, during such period, we or any of our nonpublic affiliates is acquired by a third party that is developing or commercializing a competing product, then we must divest our interest or terminate the development or commercialization of the competing product or cause our affiliate to do so.
The Takeda Agreement will expire, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, on the expiration of the royalty payment term described above for such product in such country. Either party may terminate the Takeda Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach, challenge to the patents licensed under the Takeda Agreement, or insolvency. Takeda may terminate the Takeda Agreement with respect to a compound if we cease development or commercialization of such compound. We may terminate the agreement at will, in our sole discretion, in its entirety, or with respect to relugolix for prostate cancer or both endometriosis and uterine fibroids, or on a compound by compound basis for all fields, upon prior notice, with the notice period depending on the compound and field to be terminated and the regulatory status at the time that notice of termination is given. We may also terminate the agreement with respect to a compound for safety reasons or lack of commercial viability. If the agreement is terminated in its entirety or with respect to relugolix for prostate cancer, other than for safety reasons or by us for Takeda’s uncured material breach, prior to receipt of the first regulatory approval of relugolix for prostate cancer in Japan, then we must either reimburse Takeda for its out of pocket costs and expenses directly incurred in connection with Takeda’s completion of the relugolix development for prostate cancer, up to an agreed cap, or complete ourselves the conduct of any clinical trials of relugolix for prostate cancer that are ongoing as of the effective date of such termination, at our cost and expense. If we reimburse Takeda for such costs, then under certain circumstances we may be later reimbursed by Takeda through a royalty on sales of the terminated relugolix product.
In connection with the Takeda Agreement, we issued 5,077,001 common shares, then equal to 12% of our outstanding share capital, to Takeda pursuant to a subscription agreement, and also issued Takeda a warrant to enable it to maintain its 12% ownership of us through the one-year anniversary of the warrant, unless earlier terminated as a result of our change in control. We issued a total of 2,343,624 common shares to Takeda under this warrant prior to its expiration on April 30, 2017. We also entered into an investor rights agreement with Takeda, pursuant to which Takeda and RSL, the other shareholder party thereto, are entitled to certain rights with respect to the registration of their common shares under the Securities Act. 
Manufacture and Supply Agreement with Takeda
In June 2016, we and Takeda’s affiliate, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda Limited, entered into an agreement for the manufacture and supply of relugolix. Under this agreement, Takeda Limited will supply us, and we will obtain from Takeda Limited, all of our requirements for relugolix drug substance and drug product to be used under our development plans for all indications. If we request, Takeda Limited will assist us with a technical transfer of the manufacturing process for relugolix to us or our designee and we will pay the expenses related to such transfer.

Right of First Negotiation and Board Observer Agreement with Pfizer
In October 2016, we and an entity affiliated with Pfizer Inc., or the Pfizer Affiliate, entered into a right of first negotiation and board observer agreement, or the Pfizer Agreement. Pursuant to the Pfizer Agreement, we granted to the Pfizer Affiliate, upon the closing of the sale of at least $30.0 million of our common shares to the Pfizer Affiliate in our initial public offering, or the IPO, a right of first negotiation with respect to any transaction that we would propose to a third party involving (A) the license or sale of rights to develop and commercialize relugolix or MVT-602 for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, endometriosis-associated pain, advanced prostate cancer, or female infertility as part of assisted reproduction, in each case, in a major market country, or (B) a change of control of Myovant or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets. The right of first negotiation will terminate upon the earliest of (1) the third anniversary of the IPO, (2) such time as the Pfizer Affiliate, together with its affiliates, owns less than 51% of the common shares purchased by the Pfizer Affiliate in the IPO, (3) a change of control of Myovant, (4) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets and (5) the liquidation or other dissolution of Myovant. In addition, during such period that the Pfizer Affiliate holds a right of first negotiation, one representative of the Pfizer Affiliate may attend any meetings of our board of directors in a non-voting observer capacity, subject to standard exceptions, such as conflict of interest. Such observer right will also terminate at such time as we file an NDA with the FDA for relugolix. The Pfizer Agreement will terminate upon the earliest of (1) the fifth anniversary of the closing of the IPO, (2) such time as the Pfizer Affiliate, together with its affiliates, owns less than 51% of the common shares purchased by the Pfizer Affiliate in the IPO, (3) a change of control of Myovant, (4) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets, (5) the liquidation or other dissolution of Myovant, and (6) such time as we file an NDA with the FDA for relugolix. 
Option Agreement with Roivant Sciences Limited
In June 2016, we entered into an option agreement with RSL pursuant to which RSL granted to us an option to acquire the rights to products to which RSL or any non-public affiliate of RSL acquires the rights (other than a relugolix product or a competing product, as described under the section titled “—License Agreement with Takeda” above) for uterine fibroids or endometriosis, or for which the primary target indication is hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Our option is exercisable at any time during the period commencing on November 1, 2016 (the date we closed the IPO) and ending two years following the date of first commercial sale of a relugolix product in a major market country. If we elect to exercise our option for a product, we will be required to reimburse RSL for 110% of any payments made by RSL or its affiliate for such product, and will receive an assignment of the agreement through which RSL or its affiliate acquired the rights to such product.
Information Sharing and Cooperation Agreement
In July 2016, we entered into an information sharing and cooperation agreement, or the Cooperation Agreement, with RSL. The Cooperation Agreement, among other things: (1) obligates us to deliver periodic financial statements and other financial information to RSL and to comply with other specified financial reporting requirements; and (2) requires us to supply certain material information to RSL to assist it in preparing any future SEC filings.
Subject to specified exceptions, the Cooperation Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of the mutual written consent of the parties or when RSL is no longer required by United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, to consolidate our results of operations and financial position, account for its investment in us under the equity method of accounting or, by any rule of the SEC, include our separate financial statements in any filings it may make with the SEC.
Services Agreements with Roivant Sciences, Inc. and Roivant Sciences GmbH
In July 2016, we and our wholly owned subsidiary Myovant Sciences, Inc., or MSI, entered into a formal services agreement, or the RSI Services Agreement, with Roivant Sciences, Inc., or RSI, a wholly owned subsidiary of RSL, effective April 29, 2016, under which RSI agreed to provide certain administrative and research and development services to us. Under the RSI Services Agreement, we pay or reimburse RSI for any expenses it, or third parties acting on its behalf, incurs for us. For any general and administrative and research and development activities performed by RSI employees, RSI charges back the employee compensation expense plus a pre-determined mark-up. RSI also provided such services prior to the formalization of the RSI Services Agreement, and such costs have been recognized by us in the period in which the services were rendered. Employee compensation expense, inclusive of base salary and fringe benefits, is determined based upon the relative percentage of time utilized on our matters. All other costs are billed back at cost. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include third-party expenses that have been paid by RSI and RSL.
12

In February 2017, we and MSI amended and restated the RSI Services Agreement, effective November 11, 2016, to include our wholly owned subsidiary, Myovant Sciences GmbH, or MSG, as a services recipient. In addition, in February 2017, MSG also entered into a separate services agreement with Roivant Sciences GmbH, or RSG, a wholly owned subsidiary of RSL, effective November 11, 2016, for the provisioning of services by RSG to MSG in relation to the identification of potential product candidates and project management of clinical trials, as well as other services related to clinical development, administrative, and financial activities. We refer to the services agreement between MSG and RSG and the RSI Services Agreement, collectively, as the Services Agreements.
Our Strategy 
Our goal is to be the leading global biopharmaceutical company focused on women’s health and endocrine diseases in areas of high unmet medical need, and to improve the lives of millions of patients suffering from these diseases. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include the following: 

• | rapidly advance clinical development of relugolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and endometriosis-associated pain;


• | rapidly advance clinical development of relugolix for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer;


• | advance clinical development of MVT-602;


• | expand clinical development of relugolix for additional indications;


• | acquire or in-license additional clinical- or commercial-stage product candidates for women's health or endocrine diseases in a capital-efficient manner; and


• | maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates.

Sales and Marketing 
We do not have our own marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities. In order to commercialize our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, we must either develop a sales and marketing infrastructure or collaborate with third-parties that have sales and marketing experience. We plan to directly commercialize our product candidates in the United States. In other markets for which commercialization may be less capital efficient for us, we may selectively pursue strategic collaborations with third parties in order to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates. 
Manufacturing 
We have no experience in drug formulation or manufacturing and do not own or operate, and we do not expect to own or operate, facilities for manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing of our product candidates. In June 2016, we and Takeda Limited entered into an agreement for the manufacture and supply of relugolix. Under this agreement, Takeda Limited will supply to us and we will obtain from Takeda Limited relugolix drug substance and drug product to be used under our development plans for all ongoing and near-term clinical studies. We also rely on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers for packaging and distribution of finished drug products for our clinical trials, sourcing of comparator products, and development of new products. If we request, Takeda Limited will assist us with a technical transfer of the manufacturing process for relugolix drug substance and drug product to us or our designee and we will pay the expenses related to such transfer. 
We expect that manufacturing support provided by Takeda to us under the Takeda Agreement will be sufficient for us to complete our planned Phase 3 programs for relugolix. If approved by the FDA, we also plan to rely on Takeda or other third-party manufacturers to supply us with sufficient commercial quantities of relugolix. We expect that the MVT-602 drug substance transferred from Takeda to us under the Takeda Agreement will be sufficient for our near-term development plans, however, additional process development and manufacturing would be required in order for us to complete Phase 3 clinical studies for MVT-602. We intend to contract with third-party contract manufacturers to complete the additional development and manufacturing activities for this program to fill, finish, supply, store, and distribute the drug product for this program. If there is delay in initiating a new relationship with one or more other third-party manufacturers or a delay in completing technology transfer from Takeda, we could experience delays in our development and commercialization efforts.
Relugolix is a synthetic small molecule that can be manufactured using well-established technologies. We have acquired and continue to acquire data from Takeda related to the chemical synthesis and manufacturing of relugolix drug substance and drug product, and we expect that we will be able to contract with third-party manufacturers for commercial supplies of relugolix on a cost-efficient basis based on our understanding of the conventional technologies utilized in manufacturing relugolix. We do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of any of our product candidates. In anticipation of receiving marketing approval by a regulatory agency for any one of our products, we intend to enter into agreements with Takeda and/or third-party contract manufacturers for the commercial production of those products. 
13

Manufacturing of any product candidate is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. We expect that all of our contract manufacturing organizations will manufacture relugolix under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, conditions. cGMP is a regulatory standard for the production of pharmaceuticals to be used in humans.
Competition 
We consider relugolix’s most direct competitor for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and endometriosis-associated pain to be elagolix, an oral GnRH receptor antagonist currently in Phase 3 clinical development by AbbVie. ObsEva is also developing an oral GnRH receptor antagonist, OBE2109, for the treatment of endometriosis and uterine fibroids. ObsEva has initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating multiple doses of OBE2109 in women with endometriosis and reported the initiation of a Phase 3 study in women with uterine fibroids in the first quarter of 2017. We believe the development of multiple GnRH receptor antagonists by other biopharmaceutical firms adds further validation to the therapeutic relevance of GnRH as a target for the treatment of women’s health and endocrine diseases. 
Further, Allergan is developing ulipristal acetate, a selective progesterone receptor modulator, in the United States for uterine fibroids. Allergan has reported data from two successful Phase 3 clinical trials, and expects to file an NDA with the FDA in 2017 for ulipristal acetate to treat women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. 
In addition to other GnRH receptor antagonists and selective progesterone receptor modulators in active development, we are aware of other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies as well as academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions that are developing, and may in the future develop and commercialize, products for gender-specific hormone disorders. 
Drug development is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological advancements. Our ability to compete will significantly depend upon our ability to complete necessary clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, and effectively market any drug that we may successfully develop. Our current and potential future competitors include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, and government agencies. The primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of any product candidate for which we may receive marketing approval include efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, dosing convenience, price, coverage, and reimbursement. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the United States and in foreign countries. 
Our current and potential future competitors also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors. 
Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment method for uterine fibroids, endometriosis or prostate cancer by a competitor could render our product candidate non-competitive or obsolete or reduce the demand for our product candidate before we can recover our development and commercialization expenses. 
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for relugolix, MVT-602 and any of our future product candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and know-how; to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
14

While we seek broad coverage under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the process may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringement claims. In addition, patents, if granted, expire and we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any potentially issued patents will adequately protect our products or product candidates. Following our execution of the Takeda Agreement, as of June 30, 2016, by virtue of the license of patent rights under the Takeda Agreement, we are the exclusive licensee of multiple granted U.S. patents, and pending patent applications, as well as patents and patent applications in numerous foreign jurisdictions relating to relugolix and MVT-602. For relugolix, we are the exclusive worldwide licensee, excluding the Takeda Territory. As they relate to relugolix, these patents and patent applications cover the relugolix molecule and analogs thereof as a composition of matter, the use of relugolix to treat sex-hormone dependent prostate cancer or hysteromyoma (uterine fibroids), as well as methods of manufacturing. The patent family directed to the relugolix composition of matter and methods of use naturally expires in 2024, subject to any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. The patent applications directed to methods of manufacturing, if issued, would naturally expire in 2033 subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. For example, we expect the term of the composition of matter patent to relugolix will be extended up to about five years, or 2029, under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. 
For MVT-602, we are the exclusive worldwide licensee of multiple U.S. patents and patent applications as well as patents and patent applications in numerous foreign jurisdictions. These patents and patent applications cover the MVT-602 molecule as a composition of matter, and its use in treating advanced prostate cancer, as well as certain sustained release formulations containing MVT-602. The patent family directed to the MVT-602 composition of matter and method of use naturally expires in 2028 in the United States and in 2026 ex-United States, subject to any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. The patent applications directed to the sustained-release formulations of MVT-602, if issued, would naturally expire in 2030 and 2031, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. For example, in the United States, depending on the development timeline and NDA filing and approval dates, we expect the term of the composition of matter patent to MVT-602 will be extended up to at least three years, or 2031, under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. 
Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.

Government Regulation 
FDA Drug Approval Process 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 
We cannot market a drug product candidate in the United States until the drug has received FDA approval. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally include the following:

• | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, requirements; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.

Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. 
Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. If the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial, such as whether human research subjects will be exposed to an unreasonable health risk, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations, including GCP requirements, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval at each site at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions.
16

Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine metabolism, pharmacokinetics, the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials, also called pivotal or registration trials, are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and where confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing, and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within 10 to 12 months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs to treat serious conditions that the FDA determines offer significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with GMP requirements is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include a medication guide, a communication plan for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, such as special training and certification requirements for individuals who prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry, and other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. Such supplements are typically reviewed within 10 months of receipt.
17

Post-Approval Requirements 
Once an NDA is approved, a product is subject to post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, or surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or restrictions on the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to GMP requirements after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with GMP requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with GMP requirements. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacture of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

Foreign Regulation 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Other Healthcare Laws 
Although we currently do not have any products on the market, our current and future business operations may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting, and physician sunshine laws. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to some of these laws. 
18

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item, or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, and can also result in criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Persons and entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to "cause" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, certain of our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information, and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for federal civil False Claims Act violations may include up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,957 and $21,916 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, False Claims Act violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
19

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. At present, it is unclear if we would be considered a business associate subject to HIPAA based on our business activities and service offerings upon the commercialization of a product. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney's fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties. 
The Affordable Care Act, through the enactment of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, imposes, among other things, new annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value, and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for "knowing failures." 
Many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, and/or state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Additionally, to the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we intend to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject. Although the development and implementation of compliance programs designed to establish internal control and facilitate compliance can mitigate the risk of violating these laws, and the subsequent investigation, prosecution, and penalties assessed for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements, and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
Health Reform 
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. There have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. 
In particular, the Affordable Care Act has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the Affordable Care Act revises the definition of “average manufacturer price”, or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products. In January 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a final rule regarding the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, effective April 1, 2016, that, among other things, revises the manner in which the AMP is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the program and implements certain amendments to the Medicaid rebate statute created under the Affordable Care Act. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare providers and entities, and a significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective.

We cannot predict the full impact of the Affordable Care Act on pharmaceutical companies, as many of the reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions, some of which have not yet fully occurred. Further, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. In January 2017, the President of the United States signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. In May 2017, following the passage of the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation known as the American Health Care Act, which, if enacted, would amend or repeal significant portions of the Affordable Care Act. The U.S. Senate could adopt the American Health Care Act as passed by the U.S. House of Representative or other legislation to amend or replace elements of the Affordable Care Act. Thus, it is uncertain when or if the American Health Care Act will become law. In the coming years, additional legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of our product candidates. 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the President of the United States signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. These included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Further, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the out-of-pocket cost of prescription drugs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. 
Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing, which is being phased in over several years beginning in 2015. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. 
Coverage and Reimbursement 
Sales of our products, if and when approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, private health insurers, and managed care organizations. Third-party payors generally decide which drugs they will cover and establish certain reimbursement levels for such drugs. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of our product candidates, and those of any future product candidate, will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates, and those of any future product candidate, will be paid by third-party payors. Additionally, the market for our product candidates, and those of any future product candidate, will depend significantly on access to third-party payors' formularies without prior authorization, step therapy, or other limitations such as approved lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor's decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will likely be a time-consuming process.

Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs (including drug prices) has become a priority of federal and state governments. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution by generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products once approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products once approved or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have an adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, state and federal healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
