ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

OVERVIEW 
 Commerce Union, a Tennessee corporation, was incorporated on March 4, 2011, to serve as a holding company for and the sole shareholder of Commerce Union Bank. It became the holding company of Commerce Union Bank upon completion of Commerce Union Banks reorganization into a holding company structure on June 6, 2012. 
 On March 10, 2015, the shareholders of Commerce Union approved the merger of Commerce Union Bank with Reliant Bank, which became effective on April 1, 2015 (the Merger). Each outstanding share and option to purchase a share of Reliant Bank common stock converted into the right to receive 1.0213 shares of Commerce Union common stock. After the Merger was completed, Commerce Union shareholders owned approximately 44.5% of the common stock of the Company and Reliant Banks shareholders owned approximately 55.5% of the common stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis. 
 The Merger was accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting, in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 805-10 Business Combinations. 
 As such, for accounting purposes, Reliant Bank was considered to be acquiring Commerce Union in this transaction. As a result, the financial statements of the Company prior to the Merger are the historical financial statements of Reliant Bank. The assets and liabilities of Commerce Union as of the effective date of the Merger were recorded at their respective estimated fair values and added to those of Reliant Bank. Any excess of purchase price over the net estimate fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Commerce Union were allocated to all identifiable intangibles assets. Any remaining excess was then allocated to goodwill. 
 In periods following the Merger, the comparative historical financial statements of the Company are those of Reliant Bank prior to the Merger. These consolidated financial statements include the results attributable to the operations of Commerce Union beginning on April 1, 2015. 
 Commerce Union is a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and under the bank holding company laws of the State of Tennessee. It conducts its operation through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Reliant Bank (f/k/a Commerce Union Bank) which was organized in April 17, 2006, as a state chartered bank under the laws of the State of Tennessee and opened for business on August 14, 2006. The description of the business contained in this Item 1 should be read in conjunction with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, including, but not limited to, the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto beginning on Page F-1. 
 Target Markets 
 Commerce Union, through its subsidiary Reliant Bank, provides a full range of traditional banking services throughout the Middle Tennessee Region and the Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro-Franklin Metropolitan Statistical Area (the Nashville MSA). Based on the deposit market share data published by FDIC as of June 30, 2016, the latest available date, Reliant Bank is the 15th largest bank in the Nashville MSA. Reliant Bank primarily markets its services to small businesses and residents of its market area through its main office and branch in Brentwood, Tennessee, a second branch office in Brentwood, Tennessee, a branch in Franklin, Tennessee, two branches in Gallatin, Tennessee, a branch in Nashville, Tennessee, a branch in Springfield, Tennessee, a mortgage location in Hendersonville, Tennessee, and loan production offices in Murfreesboro, Tennessee and Timonium, Maryland. Reliant Bank opened a full-service retail branch office in the Green Hills area of Nashville, Tennessee in February of 2017. A loan production office opened in Chattanooga, Tennessee in March of 2017. It employs seasoned banking professionals with experience in the market area and who are active in their communities. 
 Reliant Banks eight branches are located in Williamson, Davidson, Robertson, and Sumner County, Tennessee. In 2015, the estimated population of Williamson County was 211,672, the estimated population of Davidson County was 678,889, the estimated population of Robertson County was 68,570, and the estimated population of Sumner County was 175,989. The population of the Nashville MSA was estimated at 1,830,345 as of 2015. The median household income in the Nashville MSA for 2015 was $57,985. Significant growth of population and an increase in the median salary in the Nashville MSA are expected to continue through the next census period.

Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, Commerce Union and Reliant Bank had 143 employees on a full-time or part-time basis. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. Commerce Union believes that its relationship with its employees is good. 
Products and Services Overview 
 Reliant Bank is a full-service community bank. Its principal business is banking, consisting of lending and deposit gathering services (as well as other banking-related products and services) to businesses and individuals of the communities it serves, and the operational support to deliver, fund and manage such banking services. Reliant Bank provides a wide range of commercial banking services for businesses and individuals, including treasury management, credit cards, checking, savings, and money market deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, and loans for consumers, commercial organization, and real estate projects. Reliant Banks profitability is dependent on responsible lending with strong focus on lending standards to help ensure long-term growth in assets, loans, deposits and net income in a manner consistent with safe, sound and prudent banking practices. To achieve this goal, Reliant Banks strategy is to: (1) expand loans and deposits through organic market share growth and strategic acquisitions; (2) provide customers with a breadth of products and financial services; (3) employ, empower and motivate management to provide personalized customer service, consistent with the best traditions of community banking, while maximizing profits; and (4) maintain asset quality and control overhead expense. 
 Reliant Bank provides a variety of loans, deposits and related services to its business customers. Such services include but are not limited to business checking, mobile business banking deposit products and services, business loans, and lines of credit. Reliant Bank offers similar service to its consumers, including but not limited to personal loans, checking, residential mortgage loans and mortgage refinancing, safe deposit boxes, debit cards, direct deposit, and official bank checks. A substantial portion of our residential mortgage loans and mortgage refinancings are originated through our residential mortgage banking segment. These loans are originated throughout the United States and are typically sold in the secondary market. For a more detailed description of our residential mortgage loan operations, see Notes 20 and 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Competition 
 Reliant Bank has substantial competition in attracting and retaining deposits and making loans to its customers in all of its principal markets. Competition involves efforts to retain current customers, obtain new loans and deposits, increase type of services offered, and offer competitive interest rates on deposits and loans. The primary factors in competing for deposits are the range and quality of financial services offered, the ability to offer attractive rates and the availability of convenient office locations. Reliant Bank competes for deposits with 62 other commercial banking institutions in Davidson, Williamson, Robertson, and Sumner Counties, as well as, numerous savings and loan associations, credit unions, and issuers of commercial paper and other securities. Reliant Banks market share in its four counties is 1.55% as of June 30, 2016. According to the FDIC, there are 390 commercial bank branch offices in the four counties as of June 30, 2016. Additional competition for deposits comes from other investment alternatives, such as money market mutual funds and corporate and government securities. The primary factors in competing for loans are the range and quality of the lending services offered, interest rates, and loan origination fees. Competition for the origination of loans normally comes from other financial institutions, commercial banks, credit unions, insurance companies and other financial services companies. Reliant Bank believes that it has successfully competed with larger banks and other smaller community banks in the Williamson, Robertson, Sumner, and Davidson County markets by focusing on personal service and financial products to meets the needs of the community.

Supervision and Regulation 
 Both Commerce Union and Reliant Bank are subject to extensive state and federal banking laws and regulations that impose specific requirements or restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of virtually all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors, not shareholders. The following summary is qualified by reference to the statutory and regulatory provisions discussed. Changes in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects. Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and the policies of various regulatory authorities. We cannot predict the effect that fiscal or monetary policies, economic control, or new federal or state legislation may have on our business and earnings in the future. 
Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc. 
 Commerce Union owns 100% of the stock of Reliant Bank, and therefore, we are considered a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the Bank Holding Company Act). As a result, we are primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Moreover, as a bank holding company of a bank located in Tennessee, we also are subject to the Tennessee Banking Act. 
 The Bank Holding Company Act, subject to certain exceptions, also prohibits a bank holding company from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting stock of any company engaged in non-banking activities. An exception to this prohibition is for activities expressly found by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. 
 As a bank holding company, Commerce Union is required to file semi-annual reports with the Federal Reserve together with any additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. The Federal Reserve may also examine Commerce Union. 
 Bank holding companies are required to act as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary. This support may be required at times when a holding company may not be able to provide such support. In the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC - as a result of default of a banking or thrift subsidiary of Commerce Union or related to FDIC assistance provided to a subsidiary in danger of default - the other banking subsidiaries of Commerce Union, if any, may be assessed for the FDICs loss, subject to certain exceptions. 
 Regulation Y of the Rules and Regulations of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors requires persons acting directly or indirectly or in concert with one or more persons to give the Federal Reserve 60 days prior written notice before acquiring control of a bank holding company. Under the regulation, control is defined as the ownership or control with the power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company. The regulation also provides for a presumption of control if a person owns, controls, or holds with the power to vote 10% or more (but less than 25%) of any class of voting securities, and if no other person owns a greater percentage of that class of voting securities. 
 Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval. The payment of dividends by any bank also may be affected by other factors, such as the maintenance of adequate capital for such subsidiary bank. In addition to the foregoing restrictions, the Federal Reserve has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserves view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or that could only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding companys financial health, such as by borrowing. Furthermore, the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (TDFI) also has authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by a Tennessee chartered bank when it determines such payment to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Should an insured member bank controlled by a bank holding company be significantly undercapitalized under the applicable federal bank capital ratios, or if the bank subsidiary is undercapitalized and has failed to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or has materially failed to implement such a plan, the Federal Reserve may require prior approval for any capital distribution by the bank holding company. In addition, since our legal entity is separate and distinct from Reliant Bank and does not conduct stand-alone operations, our ability to pay dividends depends on the ability of Reliant Bank to pay dividends to us, which is also subject to regulatory restrictions.

A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are also prohibited from acquiring any voting shares of, or interest in, any banks located outside of the state in which the operations of the bank holding companys subsidiaries are located, unless the bank holding company and its subsidiaries are well-capitalized and well-managed. Further, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with the extension of credit or provision of any property or service. An affiliate of a bank holding company may not extend credit, lease, sell property, or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these on the condition that (i) the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit, property or services from or to its bank holding company or subsidiaries thereof or (ii) the customer may not obtain some other credit, property, or services from a competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended. 
 In approving acquisitions by bank holding companies of banks and companies engaged in the banking-related activities described above, the Federal Reserve considers a number of factors, including expected benefits to the public such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, as weighed against the risks of possible adverse effects such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve is also empowered to differentiate between new activities and activities commenced through the acquisition of a going concern. 
 The Attorney General of the United States may, within 30 days after approval by the Federal Reserve of an acquisition involving a bank holding company, bring an action challenging such acquisition under the federal antitrust laws, in which case the effectiveness of such approval is stayed pending a final ruling by the courts. Failure of the Attorney General to challenge an acquisition does not, however, exempt the bank holding company from complying with both state and federal antitrust laws after the acquisition is consummated or immunize the acquisition from future challenge under the anti-monopoly provisions of the Sherman Antitrust Act. 
 Capital Guidelines 
 The Federal Reserve has issued risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and member banks. Under the guidelines, the minimum ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. To be considered a well-capitalized bank or bank holding company under the guidelines, a bank or bank holding company must have a total risk-based capital ratio in excess of 10%. At least half of the total capital is to be comprised of common equity, retained earnings, and a limited amount of perpetual preferred stock, after subtracting goodwill and certain other adjustments (Tier I capital). The remainder may consist of perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt securities, a limited amount of subordinated debt, other preferred stock not qualifying for Tier I capital, and a limited amount of loan and lease loss reserves (Tier II capital). Reliant Bank is subject to these capital requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve has adopted a minimum leverage ratio (Tier I capital to total assets) of 3%. Generally, banking organizations are expected to operate well above the minimum required capital level of 3% unless they meet certain specified criteria, including that they have the highest regulatory ratings. Most banking organizations are required to maintain a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 3%, plus an additional cushion of at least 1% to 2%. The guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance upon intangible assets. 
 In July 2013, the federal banking regulators, in response to the statutory requirements of Dodd-Frank, adopted regulations implementing the Basel Capital Adequacy Accord (Basel III), which had been approved by the Basel member central bank governors in 2010 as an agreement among the countries central banks and bank regulators on the amount of capital banks must hold as a cushion against losses and insolvency. The new minimum capital to risk-weighted assets (RWA) requirements are a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital ratio of 8.0%. The minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) is 4.0%. The new rule also changes the definition of capital, mainly by adopting stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets (MSAs), deferred tax assets (DTAs), and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. In addition, the new rule requires that most regulatory capital deductions be made from common equity Tier 1 capital. 
 Under Basel III, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer is measured relative to RWA. Phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirements began on January 1, 2016, and 
 
5 
 
 the requirements will be fully phased in on January 1, 2019. A banking organization with a buffer greater than 2.5% once the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in would not be subject to limits on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer of less than 2.5% would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. The new rule also prohibits a banking organization from making distributions or discretionary bonus payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. The eligible retained income of a banking organization is defined as its net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the organizations quarterly regulatory reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. When the new rule is fully phased in, the minimum capital requirements plus the capital conservation buffer will exceed the current prompt corrective action (PCA) well-capitalized thresholds. 
 Under the new rule, MSAs and DTAs are subject to stricter limitations than those applicable under the current general risk-based capital rule. More specifically, certain DTAs arising from temporary differences, MSAs, and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock are each subject to an individual limit of 10% of common equity Tier 1 capital elements and are subject to an aggregate limit of 15% of common equity Tier 1 capital elements. The amount of these items in excess of the 10% and 15% thresholds are to be deducted from common equity Tier 1 capital. Amounts of MSAs, DTAs, and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions that are not deducted due to the aforementioned 10% and 15% thresholds must be assigned a 250% risk weight. Finally, the new rule increases the risk weights for past-due loans, certain commercial real estate loans, and some equity exposures, and makes selected other changes in risk weights and credit conversion factors. 
 The new minimum capital requirements of Basel III took effect on January 1, 2015, whereas the capital conservation buffer and the deductions from common equity Tier 1 capital phase in over time. Similarly, non-qualifying capital instruments phase out over time, except as described above. Most existing non-qualifying capital instruments issued by community banks before May 19, 2010, such as trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock, will continue to count as regulatory capital. 
 Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a financial institution could subject a banking institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to state and federal regulatory authorities, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits, and other restrictions on its business. 
 Tennessee Banking Act; Federal Deposit Insurance Act 
 Reliant Bank is incorporated under the banking laws of the State of Tennessee and is subject to the applicable provisions of those laws. Reliant Bank is subject to the supervision of the TDFI and to regular examination by that department. Reliant Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve and therefore is subject to Federal Reserve regulations and policies and is subject to regular examination by the Federal Reserve. Reliant Banks deposits are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), and Reliant Bank is, therefore, subject to the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA). 
 The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system for insured depository institutions that takes into account the risks attributable to different categories and concentrations of assets and liabilities. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), the FDIC was required to adopt regulations that would base deposit insurance assessments on total assets less capital rather than deposit liabilities and to include off-balance sheet liabilities of institutions and their affiliates in risk-based assessments. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (ESSA) provided for a temporary increase in the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. This increased level of basic deposit insurance was made permanent by the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, on October 14, 2008, the FDIC instituted temporary unlimited FDIC coverage of non-interest-bearing deposit transaction accounts, but this extra coverage expired December 31, 2012. The Dodd-Frank Act also repealed the prohibition on paying interest on demand transaction accounts, but did not extend unlimited insurance protection for these accounts. 
 The FDIC may terminate its insurance of deposits if it finds that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 
 
6 
 
Tennessee statutes and the federal law regulate a variety of the banking activities of Reliant Bank, including required reserves, investments, loans, mergers and consolidations, issuances of securities, payments of dividends, and the establishment of branches. There are certain limitations under federal and Tennessee law on the payment of dividends by banks. A state bank, with the approval of the TDFI, may transfer funds from its surplus account to the undivided profits (retained earnings) account or any part of its paid-in-capital account. The payment of dividends by any bank is dependent upon its earnings and financial condition and, in addition to the limitations referred to above, is subject to the statutory power of certain federal and state regulatory agencies to act to prevent what they deem unsafe or unsound banking practices. The payment of dividends could, depending upon our financial condition, be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice. Also, without regulatory approval, a dividend only can be paid to the extent of the net income of the bank for that year plus the net income of the prior two years. The FDIA prohibits a state bank, the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC, from paying dividends if it is in default in the payment of any assessments due the FDIC. 
 State banks also are subject to regulation respecting the maintenance of certain minimum capital levels (see above), and Reliant Bank is required to file annual reports and such additional information as the Tennessee Banking Act and Federal Reserve regulations require. We are also subject to certain restrictions on loan amounts, interest rates, insider loans to officers, directors and principal shareholders, tying arrangements, privacy, transactions with affiliates, and many other matters. Strict compliance at all times with state and federal banking laws is required. 
 Tennessee law contains limitations on the interest rates that may be charged on various types of loans and restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be granted and on the types of investments that may be made. The operations of banks are also affected by various consumer laws and regulations, including those relating to equal credit opportunity and regulation of consumer lending practices. All Tennessee banks must become and remain insured banks under the FDIA. 
 Under Tennessee law, state banks are prohibited from lending to any one person, firm, or corporation amounts more than 15% of its equity capital accounts, except (i) in the case of certain loans secured by negotiable title documents covering readily marketable nonperishable staples or (ii) we may make a loan to one person, firm or corporation of up to 25% of its equity capital accounts with the prior written approval of the Banks board of directors. 
 Community Reinvestment Act 
 The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), first enacted by Congress in 1977 and amended from time to time thereafter, requires that each depository institutions record of helping meet the needs of its entire community be evaluated by depository institutions primary federal regulator. The CRA helps assure that banks and other financial institutions make credit available to low- and moderate-income borrowers, consistent with safe and sound operations. Before the effective date of the merger, Reliant Bank earned the rating of Satisfactory in August of 2012 and Commerce Union Bank had earned a rating of Outstanding as of September 2012. 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) substantially revised the depository institution regulatory and funding provisions of the FDIA, and revised several other federal banking statutes. Among other things, FDICIA requires the federal banking regulators to take prompt corrective action in respect of FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under applicable regulations, a FDIC-insured depository institution is defined to be well capitalized if (i) it maintains a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5%, a risk-adjusted Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and (ii) it is not subject to a directive, order or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. An insured depository institution is defined to be adequately capitalized if it meets all of its minimum capital requirements as described above. In addition, an insured depository institution is considered undercapitalized if it fails to meet any minimum required measure, significantly undercapitalized if it is significantly below such measure, and critically undercapitalized if it fails to maintain a level of tangible equity equal to not less than 2% of total assets. An insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. 
 
7 
 
The capital-based prompt corrective action provision of FDICIA and their implementing regulations apply to FDIC-insured depository institutions and are not directly applicable to the holding companies that control those institutions. However, the Federal Reserve has indicated that, in regulating bank holding companies, it will take appropriate action at the holding company level based on an assessment of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary depository institutions pursuant to these provisions and regulations. 
 FDICIA generally prohibits an FDIC-insured depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of dividends) or paying any management fee to its bank holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. A depository institutions bank holding company must guarantee the capital plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institutions assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institutions capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. 
 Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator generally within 90 days of the date on which they became critically undercapitalized. 
 The FDIC has adopted regulations under FDICIA governing the receipt of brokered deposits and pass-through insurance. Under the regulations, a bank cannot accept, rollover or renew brokered deposits unless it is well-capitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that cannot receive brokered deposits also cannot offer pass-through insurance on certain employee benefit accounts. Whether or not it has obtained this waiver, an adequately capitalized bank may not pay an interest rate on any deposits in excess of 75 basis points over certain index prevailing market rates specified by regulation. There are no such restrictions on a bank that is well-capitalized. 
 FDICIA contains numerous other provisions, including accounting, audit and reporting requirements, termination of the too big to fail doctrine except in special cases, limitations on the FDICs payment of deposits at foreign branches, new regulatory standards in such areas as asset quality, earnings and compensation and revised regulatory standards for, among other things, powers of state banks, real estate lending and capital adequacy. FDICIA also requires that a depository institution provide 90 days prior notice of the closing of any branches. 
 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 
 In 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) ratified new powers for banks and bank holding companies, especially in the areas of securities and insurance. This law also includes requirements regarding the privacy and protection of non-public customer information held by financial institutions, as well as many other providers of financial services. There are provisions providing for functional regulation of the various services provided by institutions among different regulators. GLBA codified the safeguards rule which requires financial institutions to develop a written information security plan that describes how the company is prepared for and plans to continue to protect customers and consumers non-public personal information. GLBA did not remove the restrictions in the Bank Holding Company Act that prevent non-financial companies from entering retail and/or commercial banking. Finally, among many other sections of this law, there is some relief for small banks from the regulatory burden of the Community Reinvestment Act. 
 Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act 
 The Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, better known as the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires all United States financial institutions to assist United States government agencies to detect and prevent money laundering. Specifically, BSA requires financial institutions to keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, file reports of cash transactions exceeding a daily aggregate amount of $10,000, and to report suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities.

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act) substantially broadened existing anti-money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States, imposed new compliance and due diligence obligations, defined new crimes and penalties, compelled the production of documents located both inside and outside the United States, including those of foreign institutions that have a correspondent relationship in the United States, and clarified the safe harbor from civil liability to customers. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act that apply certain of its requirements to financial institutions such as our Bank. The regulations impose new obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The Treasury Department may issue additional regulations that will further clarify the USA PATRIOT Acts requirements. 
 Under the USA PATRIOT Act all financial institutions, as defined, must establish anti-money laundering compliance and due diligence programs. Such programs must include, among other things, adequate policies, the designation of a compliance officer, employee and director training programs, and an independent audit function to review and test the program. 
 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) 
 In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, incorporating numerous financial institution regulatory reforms. Many of these reforms were implemented between 2011 and 2014 through regulations promulgated by banking and securities regulators. The following discussion describes the material elements of the regulatory framework. Many of the Dodd-Frank Act provisions are stated to only apply to larger financial institutions and do not directly impact community-based institutions like Reliant Bank. For instance, provisions that regulate derivative transactions and limit derivatives trading activity of federally-insured institutions, enhance supervision of systemically significant institutions, impose new regulatory authority over hedge funds, limit proprietary trading by banks, and phase-out the eligibility of trust preferred securities for Tier 1 capital are among the provisions that do not directly impact our Bank either because of exemptions for institutions below a certain asset size or because of the nature of our Banks operations. Other provisions that impact Reliant Bank are: 

 | Change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital, eliminate the ceiling and increase the size of the floor of the DIF, and offset the impact of the increase in the minimum floor on institutions with less than $10 billion in assets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Make permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | Repeal the federal prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depositing institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to continued rulemaking and will take effect over several years, and their impact on Reliant Bank or the financial industry is difficult to predict before such regulations are adopted. However, there is a significant possibility that the Dodd-Frank Act will, in the long run, increase regulatory burden, compliance costs, and interest expense for community banks. Of particular concern to many community banks is the depth and breadth of the powers of the CFPB, which may have significant impact on consumer compliance regulation and increased costs, particularly for smaller depository institutions. 
 Volcker Rule 
 The Volcker Rule generally prohibits a banking entity (which includes any insured depository institution, such as Reliant Bank, or any affiliate or subsidiary of such depository institution, such as Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc.) from engaging in proprietary trading and acquiring or retaining any ownership interest in, sponsoring, or engaging in certain transactions with, a covered fund. Both the proprietary trading and covered fund-related prohibitions are subject to a number of exemptions and exclusions. The Volcker Rule became effective by statute in July 2012, and on December 10, 2013, five federal regulators including the FDIC and the Federal Reserve jointly adopted the final regulations to implement the Volcker Rule. The final regulations contain exemptions for, among others, market making, risk-mitigating hedging, underwriting, and trading in U.S. government and agency obligations and also permit certain ownership interests in certain types of funds to be retained. They also permit the offering and sponsoring of funds under certain conditions. In addition, the final regulations impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities. 
 The final regulations became effective on April 1, 2014, and banking entities were required to conform their proprietary trading activities and investments in and relationships with covered funds that were in place after December 31, 2013 by July 21, 2015. For those banking entities whose investments in and relationships with covered funds were in place prior to December 31, 2013 (legacy covered funds), the Volcker Rule conformance period was recently extended by the Federal Reserve to July 21, 2017 for such legacy covered funds. In addition, the Federal Reserve has also indicated its intention to grant two additional one-year extensions of the conformance period to July 21, 2017, for banking entities to conform ownership interests in and sponsorship of activities of collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, that are backed in part by non-loan assets and that were in place as of December 31, 2013. 
 FIRREA and FDICIA 
 Far-reaching legislation, including the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, or FIRREA, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, or FDICIA, have impacted the business of banking for years. FIRREA primarily affected the regulation of savings institutions rather than the regulation of commercial banks and bank holding companies like Reliant Bank and Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc., but did include provisions affecting deposit insurance premiums, acquisitions of thrifts by banks and bank holding companies, liability of commonly controlled depository institutions, receivership and conservatorship rights and procedures and substantially increased penalties for violations of banking statutes, regulations and orders. 
 FDICIA resulted in extensive changes to the federal banking laws. The primary purpose of FDICIA was to authorize additional borrowings by the FDIC in order to assist in the resolution of failed and failing financial institutions. However, the law also instituted certain changes to the supervisory process and contained various provisions affecting the operations of banks and bank holding companies. 
 The additional supervisory powers and regulations mandated by FDICIA include a prompt corrective action program based upon five regulatory zones for banks, in which all banks are placed largely based on their capital positions. Regulators are permitted to take increasingly harsh action as a banks financial condition declines. Regulators are also empowered to place in receivership or require the sale of a bank to another depository institution when a banks ratio of tangible equity to total assets reaches two percent. Better capitalized institutions are generally subject to less onerous regulation and supervision than banks with lesser amounts of capital. The Federal Reserve has adopted regulations implementing the prompt corrective action provisions of the FDICIA, which place financial institutions into one of the following five categories based upon capitalization ratios as these ratios have been amended following regulations implementing the requirements of Basel III: (1) a well capitalized institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a leverage ratio of at least 5% and a CET1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%; (2) an adequately capitalized institution has a total risk-based ratio of at least 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of at least 6%, a leverage ratio of at least 4% and a CET1 capital ratio of at least 4.5%; (3) an undercapitalized institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of under 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of under 6%, a leverage ratio of under 4% or a CET1 capital ratio of less than 4.5%; (4) a 
 
10 
 
 significantly undercapitalized institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of under 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of under 4%, a leverage ratio of under 3% or a CET1 capital ratio of less than 3%; and (5) a critically undercapitalized institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of 2% or less. Institutions in any of the three undercapitalized categories would generally be prohibited from declaring dividends or making capital distributions. The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital. 
 Various other sections of the FDICIA impose substantial audit and reporting requirements and increase the role of independent accountants and outside directors. Set forth below is a list containing certain other significant provisions of the FDICIA: 
 

 | annual on-site examinations by regulators (except for smaller, well-capitalized banks with high management ratings, which must be examined every 18 months);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | mandated annual independent audits by independent public accountants and an independent audit committee of outside directors for institutions with more than $500,000,000 in assets;

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | restrictions on the activities engaged in by state banks and their subsidiaries as principal, including insurance underwriting, to the same activities permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries unless the state bank is well capitalized and a determination is made by the FDIC that the activities do not pose a significant risk to the insurance fund;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a review by each regulatory agency of accounting principles applicable to reports or statements required to be filed with federal banking agencies and a mandate to devise uniform requirements for all such filings;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the institution by each regulatory agency of noncapital safety and soundness standards for each institution it regulates which cover (1) internal controls, (2) loan documentation, (3) credit underwriting, (4) interest rate exposure, (5) asset growth, (6) compensation, fees and benefits paid to employees, officers and directors, (7) operational and managerial standards, and (8) asset quality, earnings and stock valuation standards for preserving a minimum ratio of market value to book value for publicly traded shares (if feasible);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | uniform regulations regarding real estate lending; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


 | a review by each regulatory agency of the risk-based capital rules to ensure they take into account adequate interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk, and the risks of non-traditional activities.

Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 
 The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act) increased the threshold under which a bank or bank holding company may terminate registration of a security under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to 1,200 shareholders of record from 300. The JOBS Act also raised the threshold requiring companies to register to 2,000 shareholders from 500. Since the JOBS Act was signed, numerous banks or bank holding companies have filed to deregister their common stock.

 FDIC Insurance Premiums 
 Reliant Bank is required to pay quarterly FDIC deposit insurance assessments to the DIF. The FDIC merged the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) to form the DIF on March 31, 2006, in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The amount each institution is assessed is based upon statutory factors that include the balance of insured deposits as well as the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund. The FDIC uses a risk-based premium system that assesses higher rates on those institutions that pose greater risks to the DIF. 
 Effective April 1, 2009, the FDIC revised its risk-based assessment system to adjust the risk-based calculation of an institutions unsecured debt, secured liabilities and brokered deposits. On November 12, 2009, the FDIC announced a final rule to increase of 3 basis points the deposit assessment base rate, beginning January 1, 2011. Additional increases in premiums will impact Reliant Banks earnings adversely. Depending on any future losses that the FDIC insurance fund may suffer due to failed institutions, there can be no assurance that there will not be additional significant premium increases in order to replenish the fund. 
 Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a federal bank regulatory agency. 
 Effects of Governmental Policies 
 Reliant Banks earnings are affected by the difference between the interest earned by Reliant Bank on its loans and investments and the interest paid by Reliant Bank on its deposits or other borrowings. The yields on its assets and the rates paid on its liabilities are sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest. Thus, the earnings and growth of Reliant Bank are influenced by general economic conditions, fiscal policies of the federal government, and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve, which establishes national monetary policy. The nature and impact of any future changes in fiscal or monetary policies cannot be predicted.

Commercial banks are affected by the credit policy of various regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and limitations on interest rates that banks may pay on time and savings deposits. The Federal Reserve uses these means in varying combinations to influence overall growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also to affect interest rates charged on loans, received on investments or paid for deposits. 
 The monetary and fiscal policies of regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve, also affect the banking industry. Through changes in the reserve requirements against bank deposits, open market operations in U.S. Government securities and changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings, the Federal Reserve influences the cost and availability of funds obtained for lending and investing. No prediction can be made with respect to possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels or loan demand or with respect to the impact of such changes on the business and earnings of Reliant Bank. 
 From time to time, legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities, or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. With the enactments of EESA, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and the Dodd-Frank Act and the significant number of regulations that have or will be promulgated under these and other laws affecting financial institutions, the nature and extent of the future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions, and the resulting impact on those institutions is and will be unpredictable. Bills are currently pending which may have the effect of changing the way our Bank conducts its business.
