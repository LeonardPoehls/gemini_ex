Corporate Overview and 2017 Change in Control
 
We are currently a “shell company” with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company. We were initially an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 25, 2007. Our business office is located at 22A-3, Jalan Metro Pudu, Off Jalan Loke Yew, Fraser Business Park 55100, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
 
Effective August 29, 2017, Contact Minerals Corp. (the “Company”) and Kerry McCullagh, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary and Treasurer (the “Seller”) entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Shiong Han Wee and Kwueh Lin Wong (Mr. Wee and Mr. Wong. collectively being the “Purchasers”). Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers agreed to purchase 7,000,000 shares from the Seller (the Seller Shares”) and 78,770,000 shares from the Company (the “Issued Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $350,000.
 
In connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement, Mr. McCullagh received $350,000, $50,000 of which was allocated to the Seller Shares and $300,000 to the Issued Shares. The $300,000 was directed to Mr. McCullagh in full settlement of all company debts owed to Mr. McCullagh and in consideration of settling any claims against the Company by Mr. McCullagh. The sale of the Seller Shares and the Issued Shares consummated September 11, 2017.
 
Upon the consummation of the sale, Kerry McCullagh, Alex Langer and William McCullagh, our former executive officers and directors, resigned from all of their positions with the Company. Their resignations were not due to any dispute or disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices.
 
The following individuals were appointed to serve in the positions set forth next to their names below:
 

Name | Age | Position

Chee Kuen Chim and Pui Hold Ho were each appointed to serve as a Director of the Company effective September 22, 2017.
 
We currently have no business operations or significant assets. We are in active discussions to acquire a company operating in the mobile and technology space that is affiliated with Messrs. Wee and Wong. While we hope to make such acquisition in the near future there can be no assurances that we will be successful in acquiring our identified target company or another operating company, if at all.
 
Employees. As of the date of this Annual Report, we did not have any employees. We expect to hire employees after the acquisition of an operating business.
