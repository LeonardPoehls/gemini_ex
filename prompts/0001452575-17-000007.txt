Item 1.    BUSINESS.
Our Company
Mead Johnson Nutrition Company is a global leader in pediatric nutrition with approximately $3.7 billion in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. We are committed to being the world’s leading nutrition company for infants and children and to helping nourish the world’s children for the best start in life. Our Enfa family of brands, including Enfamil infant formula, is the world’s leading brand franchise in pediatric nutrition, based on retail sales, and accounted for approximately 80% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our comprehensive product portfolio addresses a broad range of nutritional needs for infants, children and expectant and nursing mothers. We have over 100 years of innovation experience during which we have developed or improved many breakthrough or category-defining products across our product portfolio. Our singular focus on pediatric nutrition and our implementation of a business model that integrates nutritional science with health care and consumer marketing expertise differentiate us from many of our competitors.
We market our portfolio of more than 70 products to mothers, health care professionals and retailers in more than 50 countries in Asia, North America, Latin America and Europe. Our three reportable segments are Asia, Latin America and North America/Europe, which comprised 50%, 17% and 33%, respectively, of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5. Segment Information” for additional financial information by segment and geographical area. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 72% of our net sales were generated outside of the United States.
We believe parents and health care professionals associate the Mead Johnson name and our Enfa family of brands with quality, science-based pediatric nutrition products. Our products are marketed around the world through our global sales and marketing efforts. We believe that the strength of our brands allows us to create and maintain consumer loyalty across our product portfolio.
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we refer to Mead Johnson Nutrition Company and its subsidiaries throughout as “the Company,” “MJN,” “Mead Johnson,” “we” or “us.” For purposes of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the term China refers to the Company’s businesses in mainland China and Hong Kong.
Our History
Mead Johnson was founded in 1905 and introduced Dextri-Maltose, our first infant feeding product, in 1911. Over the next several decades, we built upon our leadership in science-based nutrition, introducing many innovative infant feeding products while expanding into vitamins, pharmaceutical products and children’s nutrition. Some of our products, developed in cooperation with clinicians and leading nutrition researchers, established a partnership between Mead Johnson and the scientific community that continues to this day. During the course of our history, we expanded our operations into extensive geographies outside of the United States and now focus solely on pediatric nutrition. Throughout our history, our deeply-held commitments to support good nutrition early in life and to improve the health and development of infants and children around the world have been hallmarks of our organization.
In 1967, we became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (“BMS”). In February 2009, we completed our initial public offering of common stock, following which BMS retained a significant ownership interest in the Company.  BMS then completed a split-off of its remaining interest in Mead Johnson in December 2009 making Mead Johnson an independent public company.  The Company is currently headquartered in Glenview, Illinois and is scheduled to relocate its corporate headquarters to Chicago, Illinois in the first half of 2017.
Merger Agreement 
On February 10, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, a company incorporated in England and Wales (“Reckitt Benckiser”), and Marigold Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Reckitt Benckiser (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Reckitt Benckiser will indirectly acquire the Company by means of a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (the “Merger”). The Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement have been unanimously approved by the Company’s board of directors. 
At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, each share of the Company’s common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) each share held by the Company as treasury stock (other than shares held for the account of clients, customers or other persons), (ii) each share held by Reckitt Benckiser or by any subsidiary of either the Company or Reckitt Benckiser and (iii) each share held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive $90.00 in cash, without interest.
1

Consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions, including, among others: (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock; (ii) the affirmative vote of a simple majority of Reckitt Benckiser’s shareholders at a shareholder meeting; (iii) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the receipt of certain other non-United States regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger; and (iv) in the case of Reckitt Benckiser's obligations to consummate the Merger, the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement). Reckitt Benckiser and Merger Sub's respective obligations to consummate the Merger are not subject to any financing condition or other contingency.
Additional information about the Merger Agreement is set forth in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 13, 2017.
Our Product Portfolio
Our product portfolio, which addresses a wide range of pediatric nutritional needs, consists of two principal product categories: infant formula and children’s nutrition, which represented 59% and 40%, respectively, of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our product categories can be separated into the following general product types: (i) routine infant, (ii) solutions, (iii) specialty, (iv) children’s nutrition and (v) other. Our routine infant formula is intended for healthy consumers while our solutions and specialty products are offered for infants with common feeding problems and special nutritional needs. Our children’s nutrition products are designed to meet the nutritional needs of children at different stages of development. Our other products (representing approximately 1% of net sales) include maternal nutrition products, vitamins, supplements and oral electrolyte solutions for infants and children. We market products under different names in various regions across the world based on marketing strategies and brand recognition.
Our most prominent product form around the world is milk-based powder. We also produce several products in liquid form for sale primarily in North America. In relevant markets, liquids are available in routine, solutions, specialty and children’s nutrition products. In addition, we have introduced certain non-GMO products in an effort to provide parents with options that meet a variety of preferences. 
Routine Infant Formula. We design routine infant formula for healthy, full-term infants without special nutritional needs both for use as the infant’s sole source of nutrition and as a supplement to breastfeeding. Our key routine infant formula products include Enfamil Premium, Enfamil A+, Enfalac Premium and Enfapro A+. We endeavor to develop routine infant formula that includes the most beneficial attributes of breast milk. Each product is referred to as a “formula,” as it is formulated for the specific nutritional needs of an infant at a given age. Generally, our routine infant formulas have the following four main components: (1) protein from cow’s milk that is processed to have a profile similar to human milk, (2) a blend of vegetable fats (including docosahexaenoic acid (“DHA”) and arachidonic acid (“ARA”)) to replace bovine milk fat in order to better resemble the composition of human milk, (3) a carbohydrate, generally lactose from cow’s milk and (4) a vitamin and mineral “micronutrient” pre-mix that is blended into the product to meet the specific needs of the infant at a given age.  In certain geographies, we have introduced a premium-priced product (Enfinitas in China and Enspire in the United States). This premium-priced formulation has two innovative components, lactoferrin and milk fat globule membrane (“MFGM”), both of which are naturally found in human breast milk and provide important benefits (lactoferrin to support immune health and MFGM to foster cognitive development). MFGM is also present in our Enfa products in several other markets.
Solutions Products. We design several solutions formulas to address common feeding tolerance problems, including spit-up, fussiness, gas and lactose intolerance. Our primary solutions products include Enfamil Gentlease (for fussiness and gas), Enfamil A.R. (to reduce spit-up), Enfamil ProSobee (a soy-based formula) and Enfamil LactoFree (for lactose intolerance). 
Specialty Products. We design specialty formulas to address certain conditions or special medical needs, including Nutramigen (for cow’s milk protein allergies) and Puramino (an amino acid formula for severe cow’s milk protein allergies or multiple other food allergies). We design products such as Enfamil Premature to meet the unique needs of premature and low birth weight infants under the supervision of a doctor, most often in the hospital, and EnfaCare, a hypercaloric formula for premature babies at home. We also produce medical foods, or foods for special medical purposes, for nutritional management of individuals with rare, inborn errors of metabolism such as maple syrup urine disease (Mead Johnson BCAD) and phenylketonuria (Mead Johnson Phenyl-Free). Certain of these products are intended for infants and young children while others are suitable for children and adults.
Children’s Nutrition Products. We design our children’s products to meet the changing nutritional needs of children at different stages of development (i.e. toddlers and older children). Our primary children’s nutrition products include Enfagrow, Sustagen and Lactum. These products are not breast milk substitutes and are not designed as a sole source of nutrition but instead are designed to be a part of a child’s appropriate diet. MFGM is present in certain of our children’s Enfa products as well. We also offer “milk modifiers” (ChocoMilk and Cal-C-Tose) that, when added to a glass of milk, enhance the milk’s nutritional value. In China, we have introduced a premium-priced, children’s nutrition product (Enfinitas, discussed above). 
2

Other Products. We also produce a range of other products, including pre-natal and post-natal nutritional supplements for expectant and nursing mothers, including Expecta and EnfaMama. Our pediatric vitamin products sold in some geographies, such as Enfamil Poly-Vi-Sol, provide a range of benefits for infants, including multivitamins and iron supplements. Our Enfalyte product, sold in North America, is an oral electrolyte solution designed for infants and children to quickly replace electrolytes and water to help restore hydration.
The following table shows sales for each of the above-described product types as a percentage of our total net sales over each of the past three fiscal years.

% of Total Net Sales | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Routine Infant Formula | 36 | % | | 37 | % | 38 | %
Solutions Products* | 13 | % | | 13 | % | 11 | %
Specialty Products* | 10 | % | | 9 | % | 8 | %

Other | 1 | % | | 2 | % | 2 | %
Total Other | 1 | % | | 2 | % | 2 | %
* These products can be consumed by children; however, a majority of such products are consumed by infants. 

Global Supply Chain
We manage sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our product portfolio through our global supply chain.
Sourcing. We source approximately 75% of our materials from approximately 40 suppliers worldwide. Through our suppliers, we obtain key raw materials and primary packaging materials on a global basis. These raw materials are subject to review and approval by our regional teams to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and quality standards. Certain raw materials, while managed and purchased by contract on a global basis, are subject to regional and local variations in price under the terms of these supply agreements. For example, the cost of dairy, agricultural oils, and packaging materials are affected by global commodity changes. As such, we are often exposed to price volatility related to market conditions outside of our control. Dairy products, consisting primarily of milk powders, non-fat dry milk, lactose and whey protein concentrates, accounted for approximately 32% of our global expenditures for raw materials and approximately 19% of our cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Manufacturing and Finishing Locations; Quality Departments. We currently operate in-house production facilities at different locations around the world. Our manufacturing and finishing facilities are located in the United States, the Netherlands, Mexico, Brazil, Singapore, Thailand, China and the Philippines. See “Item 2. Properties” for a description of our global manufacturing facilities. We also use third-party manufacturers for a portion of our production requirements. As the production process advances, regional or sub-regional teams support the global team by overseeing manufacturing activities such as the finishing of our products. As we adapt to Chinese consumers’ shifting demand for fully imported products, we increasingly manufacture and finish our products in the Netherlands for shipment to China. 
 Our four regional quality departments located in the United States, the Netherlands, Mexico and Singapore perform regional and manufacturing site quality control and assurance.  The quality assurance work in the regions is supported by a Global Quality Assurance group which provides additional expertise for specific areas. Our products undergo extensive quality and safety checks throughout the manufacturing process, from raw materials to finished product.  Our regional quality departments perform routine manufacturing site inspections focused on regulatory requirements, food safety, continuous quality improvement, ingredient supplier quality and third-party compliance.  Our products meet all local and nationally required regulatory, safety and nutrition requirements, including the Codex Alimentarius, or food code, standards where applicable, the U.S. Infant Formula Act in the United States and specific national, local and regional requirements elsewhere (See “—Regulatory and Legal” below for further details).  Nevertheless, the Company is constantly driving improvement in quality and, as such, these regulations are seen as the minimum requirements; our internal rigorous standards and quality ambition meet or exceed such requirements. 
3

Distribution. We manage our distribution networks locally with regional oversight. We generally enter into distribution agreements with third-party logistics providers and distributors and maintain a small staff at the local or regional level to track performance and implement initiatives.
Sales and Marketing
We conduct regional marketing within a strategic framework focused on both parents and health care professionals in accordance with country-specific regulatory requirements. We maintain both a health care professional sales force and a retail sales organization within our regions throughout the world. Our marketing activities vary from region to region depending on our market position, consumer trends and the regulatory environment. Our marketing teams seek to anticipate market and consumer trends, and attempt to capture consumer insights to determine strategy for brand communication, product innovation and demand-creation programs. The marketing teams work with external agencies to create marketing campaigns for consumers, health care professionals and retail sales organizations, where permitted.
Consumers. Parental preference plays an important role in brand selection. Where permitted, we participate in a variety of evidence-based marketing activities for consumers that emphasize our superior nutritional science, including digital, print and television advertising, direct mail, internet and promotional programs. In particular, we have invested in targeted digital marketing programs that allow us to attract new or prospective parents’ attention online, engage with potential consumers by connecting them to relevant content reflective of their needs and then provide targeted, specific information and product offers. We have developed technology platforms to support e-commerce and mobile commerce within our regions across the globe. Moreover, we have invested significant resources to support trends in consumer preference for premium products in key markets.
Health Care Professionals. Our health care professional sales force educates health care professionals, as permitted, about the benefits of our infant formula products in each of the countries where we market our infant formula products. We focus our product detailing efforts on neonatal intensive care units, physicians and other health care professionals, hospital group purchasing organizations and other integrated buying organizations. We also support health care professionals by organizing continuing medical education programs, symposia and other educational interfaces.
Retail Sales. Our retail sales force markets our products to each of the retail channels where our products are purchased by consumers, including mass merchandisers (e.g. Walmart), e-commerce retailers, baby stores, club stores, grocery stores, drug stores and, to a limited extent, convenience stores. The size, role and purpose of our retail sales organization varies significantly from country to country depending on our market position, the consolidation of the retail trade, emphasis on e-commerce, shopper trends and the regulatory environment.
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (“WIC”)
The WIC program is a U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) program created to provide nutritious foods, nutrition education and referrals to health care professionals and other social services to those considered to be at nutritional risk, including low-income pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding women and infants and children up to age five. It is estimated that approximately 46% of all infants born in the United States during the 12-month period ended December 31, 2016 benefited from the WIC program. The USDA program is administered individually by each state.
Most state WIC programs provide vouchers that participants use at authorized food stores to obtain the products covered by the program, including infant formula. Following a sealed, competitive bidding process, state WIC agencies enter into contracts with manufacturers, pursuant to which the state WIC agency provides mothers with vouchers for a single manufacturer’s brand of infant formula and, in return, the manufacturer gives the state WIC agency a rebate for each unit of infant formula redeemed by WIC participants. Retailers purchase infant formula directly from the manufacturer, paying the manufacturer’s published wholesale price. Mothers redeem the vouchers received from the state WIC agency for infant formula at authorized retailers. The retailer is then reimbursed the full retail price by the state WIC agency for redeemed vouchers. On a monthly basis, each state WIC agency invoices the contracted manufacturer for an amount equal to the number of units of infant formula for which vouchers were redeemed by the state WIC agency and reimbursed to retailers during the month multiplied by the agreed rebate per unit.
The bid solicitation process is determined by each state’s procurement laws, but the process is relatively standardized across the WIC program. Some states form groups and hold their bid processes jointly while other states solicit bids individually. Some states split bids between separate contracts for milk- and soy-based formulas. During the bid process, each manufacturer submits a sealed bid. The manufacturer with the lowest net price, calculated as the manufacturer’s published wholesale price less the manufacturer’s rebate bid, is usually awarded the contract. WIC contracts are generally three years in duration with some contracts providing for extensions. Specific contract provisions can vary significantly from state to state.

Participation in the WIC program is an important part of our U.S. business based on the volume of infant formula sold under the program. As of December 31, 2016, we held the contracts that supplied approximately 43% of WIC births in the United States. WIC sales represented approximately 16% of our global gross sales in the year ended December 31, 2016.  After taking into account the rebates we paid to the state WIC agencies, net WIC sales represented approximately 1% of our global net sales in the year ended December 31, 2016. The general benefits that we derive from holding the WIC contract in a particular state extend beyond the actual sales made in connection with the WIC program in the relevant state. Such benefits include full price sales from product purchased in excess of the rebated volume and the increased presence of our products in hospitals and at retailers. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Changes in WIC, or our participation in it, could materially adversely affect our business.”
Customers
Our products are sold principally to distributors and retail customers, both nationally and internationally. Sales to two of our customers, DKSH International Ltd., a distributor serving primarily Asia (including sales to its regional affiliates), and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (including sales to Sam’s Club), accounted for approximately 14%, 14% and 16%, and approximately 12%, 12% and 11%, of our gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
Research and Development
Investing in innovation through our research and development (“R&D”) capabilities and projects is an important part of our business. Our R&D organization consists of professionals, many of who have extensive industry experience and advanced educational backgrounds. Our global R&D centers are located in the United States, Mexico, Thailand, China, the Netherlands and Singapore. Our four Pediatric Nutrition Institutes (“PNI”) are located in the United States, Mexico, China and Singapore.
We organize our R&D on a global basis because our science-based products address nutritional needs that are broadly common around the world. We then rely on our regional R&D teams to incorporate any geographic-specific consumer behaviors and preferences. This is especially relevant when we make adjustments to our children’s product range and/or when we respond to local and regional changes in the regulatory landscape.
We also have external development relationships that complement our internal R&D capabilities. We manage our R&D activities in collaboration with leading scientists, institutes and commercial suppliers around the world. We believe this approach allows us to be at the forefront of scientific and technological developments relevant for pediatric nutrition. R&D expense was $97.4 million, $108.4 million and $115.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
Intellectual Property
We own patents and have submitted patent applications both in the United States and in other countries of interest to Mead Johnson. Our patent rights relate primarily to ingredients (and combinations thereof) that we use in our products. We augment our portfolio by licensing technology from suppliers of a variety of ingredients used in our products. We believe that our patent portfolio is designed such that the expiration of any single patent would not have a material impact on our business. We also hold an extensive portfolio of trademarks across our key markets. Our trademark rights relate primarily to our Enfa family of brands and other important brands. We file and maintain trademarks in those countries in which we have, or desire to have, a business presence. In addition to patents, licenses and trademark protections, we rely on a combination of security measures, confidentiality policies, contractual arrangements and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary formulas and other valuable trade secrets.
Competition
We compete in two primary categories, infant formula and children’s nutrition. The competitive landscape in each category is similar around the world, as the majority of the large global players are active in these categories. Our main global competitors include Nestlé, Danone and Abbott. We have local and regional competitors as well. Other companies, including manufacturers of branded products, private label and store brand products, manufacture and sell one or more products with a similar purpose to those marketed by us. We believe sources of our competitive advantage include the unique nutrition science and innovation behind our products, clinical claims for efficacy and product quality, brand image and associated value, broad sales force and distribution capabilities and consumer satisfaction. Significant expenditures for product development, advertising, promotion and marketing, where permitted, are generally required to achieve acceptance of products among consumers and health care professionals and to support the trend in consumer preferences for premium products in key markets.
5

Regulatory and Legal
We are subject to laws and regulations in each country in which we market our products. We have processes, systems and resources in place to manage compliance with current regulatory requirements and to participate proactively in the shaping of future country, regional and global policy, guidance and regulations.
Rules and Regulations. In the United States, infant formula manufacturers are governed by the rules and regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“U.S. FDA”) and its Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition in connection with the Infant Formula Act of 1980. Outside of the United States, country-specific regulations define the requirements with which infant and children’s formula must comply with regard to definition, composition, safety, quality, labeling and marketing as well as requirements for placing new formulas on the market. Many country-specific requirements are comparable to or will refer to regulations, guidelines and policies promulgated by the U.S. FDA, the European Commission, the Codex Alimentarius and/or the World Health Organization (discussed below). Global regulatory provisions that govern our ability to bring innovative formulas to market have become increasingly stringent with regard to requirements for scientific substantiation for innovation. Similarly, regulatory criteria with respect to safety and quality requirements have become increasingly stringent. It is our policy to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in each country in which we do business.
Policy and Guidance. The Codex Alimentarius (also referred to as “the Codex” or “the food code”) is a collection of internationally recognized standards, codes of practice, guidelines and other recommendations related to foods. The Codex, managed jointly by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (“FAO”) and the World Health Organization, has become the global reference point for consumers, food producers and processors, national food control agencies and the international food trade. The Codex includes several standards regarding formulas and foods for infants and young children. World Health Organization (“WHO”) policies and, in particular, the WHO’s International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes (the “WHO Code”), are relevant to infant formula manufacturers, particularly when the WHO Code is incorporated into country-specific regulatory requirements. Certain advocates and governmental and non-governmental organizations (particularly in Hong Kong, Mexico, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Colombia and Singapore) have advocated for heightened restrictions on the marketing, labeling and even the sale of some pediatric nutrition products as well as trademark restrictions, restrictions on interactions with health care providers and bans on claims for products covering children up to three years of age, including the “Guidance on Ending the Inappropriate Promotion of Foods for Infants and Young Children” that was published by the WHO in 2016. The Company and other industry participants were unable to persuade the WHO to modify its guidance to recognize the scientifically proven benefits of infant formula products. The WHO guidance is now under consideration for potential legislation in several countries where we market our products.
Environmental, Health and Safety
Our facilities and operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety (“EHS”) laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We have programs that are designed to ensure that our operations and facilities meet or exceed standards established by applicable EHS rules and regulations globally. Each of our manufacturing facilities undergoes periodic internal audits relating to EHS requirements and we incur operating and capital costs to enhance our facilities or maintain compliance with applicable requirements on an ongoing basis.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 7,600 people worldwide.
