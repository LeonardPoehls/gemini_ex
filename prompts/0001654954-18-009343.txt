  Overview
  
   We are a Colorado-based healthy beverage company engaged in the development and commercialization of a portfolio of organic, natural and other better-for-you healthy beverages. We market a full portfolio of Ready-to-Drink (“RTD”) better-for-you beverages including competitive offerings in the kombucha, tea, coffee, functional waters, relaxation drinks, energy drinks, rehydrating beverages, and functional medical beverage segments. We differentiate our brands through superior functional performance characteristics and ingredients and offer products that are 100% organic and natural, with no high-fructose corn syrup (“HFCS”), no-genetically modified organisms (“GMOs”), no preservatives, and only natural flavors, fruits, and ingredients. We rank as the 58th largest non-alcoholic beverage company in the world, one of largest healthy beverage companies, and the fastest growing according to Beverage Industry Magazine annual rankings and Markets and Markets. Our goal is to become the world’s leading healthy beverage company, with leading brands for consumers, leading growth for retailers and distributors, and leading return on investment for shareholders. Our target market is health conscious consumers, who are becoming more interested and better educated on what is included in their diets, causing them to shift away from less healthy options such as carbonated soft drinks or other high caloric beverages and towards alternative beverages choices. Consumer awareness of the benefits of healthier lifestyles and the availability of heathier beverages is rapidly accelerating worldwide, and New Age is capitalizing on that shift.
 Corporate History
  
 New Age Beverages Corporation was formed under the laws of the State of Washington on April 26, 2010, under the name American Brewing Company, Inc. (“American Brewing”).
  
  On April 1, 2015, American Brewing acquired the assets of B&R Liquid Adventure, which included the brand, Búcha Live Kombucha. Prior to acquiring the Búcha Live Kombucha brand and business, we were a craft brewery operation. In April 2016, new management assumed daily operation of the business, and began the implementation of a new vision for the Company. In May 2016 we changed our name to Búcha, Inc. (“Búcha”), and then on June 30, 2016, we acquired the combined assets of “Xing” including Xing Beverage, LLC, New Age Beverages, LLC, Aspen Pure, LLC, and New Age Properties. We then shut down all California operations where Búcha was based, relocated the Company’s operational headquarters to Denver, Colorado, and changed our name to New Age Beverages Corporation. On October 1, 2015, we then sold American Brewing including their brewery, brewery assets and its related liabilities to focus exclusively on the healthy beverages. We recognized the sale of our brewery and brewery operations as a discontinued operation beginning in the third quarter of 2015, and ultimately concluded the transaction in February 2016. In February 2017, we uplisted onto The NASDAQ Capital Market. In March 2017, we acquired the assets of Maverick Brands, including their brand Coco-Libre. In June 2017, we acquired the assets of Premier Micronutrient Corporation (“PMC”), and also completed the acquisition of the Marley Beverage Company (“Marley”) including the brand licensing rights to all Marley brand ready to drink beverages.
 
 We have three wholly-owned subsidiaries, NABC, Inc., NABC Properties, LLC (NABC Properties”), and New Age Health Sciences. NABC, Inc. is our Colorado-based operating company that consolidates performance and financial results of our divisions. NABC Properties incorporates all our buildings and warehouses, and New Age Health Sciences includes all our patents, and the operating performance in the medical and hospital channels.
  
  Principal products
  
  Our core business is to develop, market, sell and distribute healthy ready-to-drink beverages. The beverage industry comprises $870 Billion in annual revenue according to Euromonitor and Booz & Company and is highly competitive with three to four major multibillion dollar multinationals that dominate the sector. We compete by differentiating our brands as healthier and better-for-you alternatives that are natural, organic, and/or have no artificial ingredients or sweeteners. Our brands include Xing, Aspen Pure, Marely, Búcha Live Kombucha, PediaAde, Coco-Libre, Bio-Shield, and ‘n-Hanced, all competing in the existing growth and newly emerging dynamic growth segments of the beverage industry.

The brand is now available nationwide across multiple channels of distribution from traditional grocery to health food and specialty outlets to hypermarkets to club stores, to pharmacy and drug outlets, to gas and convenience outlets. XingTea competes in the RTD Tea category that according to Euromonitor International exceeded $50 Billion in annual revenue with a CAGR of 10.9% since 2012.
  
  Xing Craft Brew Collection Tea
  
 Xing Craft Brew Collection Tea is a 100% organic, premium brewed line of artisanal teas sold in 16 oz glass bottles with no added sugar and no artificial flavors. Xing Craft Collection comes in five trending flavor combinations including Hibiscus Honey Blossom, Ginger Georgia Peach, Japanese Mountain Green, and Madagascar Vanilla Chai.
  
  The premium brewed tea segment has emerged over the past two years defined by brands from major competitors including Gold Peak, Pure Leaf, Teavana and others in 16 oz packaging and priced at $1.89 to $2.29 in major grocery and convenience retail. Unlike competitors that have more than 21 grams of added sugar, Xing Craft has no added sugar, and is an artisanal brewed team made with single origin grown tea blends. The sub segment is estimated to comprise more than $2 billion in revenue according to Nielsen, Spins, and Markets and Markets, with gross margins significantly more attractive than the more price driven large format can tea segment.
  
  Xing Craft Collection Lemonade
  
  Xing Craft Collection Lemonade is a 100% organic, premium line of lemonades with coconut water sold in 16 oz glass bottles with lower sugar and no artificial flavors.

 XingEnergy is an all-natural, non-GMO, non-HFCS, vitamin-enriched, better-for-you energy drink, made with all-natural fruit flavors and contains the full recommended daily allowance of B-Complex vitamins. XingEnergy is offered in limited distribution, as the energy drinks segment is dominated by a few key players and the segment overall is one of significant competitive intensity.
  
  XingEnergy comes in four flavors including Tangerine Dream, Grape Attack, Mad Melon, and Grapefruit Go packaged in 16 oz cans, sold individually. XingEnergy competes in the energy drinks category, and according to Grandview Research and Research and Markets, the global energy drink market size was $49.9 Billion with a CAGR of 9.8% since 2012.
  
  Aspen Pure PH and Aspen Pure Probiotic

5


  
 
  Aspen Pure has no added minerals or electrolytes and comes out of the ground at a natural PH-balanced level of up to 7.0. Aspen Pure is then purified and bottled at the source in New Age’s own manufacturing facilities. Aspen Pure is commercialized primarily in a 5 state area in and around the Company’s home Colorado market. There are no current plans to expand or invest in it beyond its current distribution as the premium bottled water segment is a highly competitive, expensive, and broadly undifferentiated segment in which to compete. Aspen Pure Probiotic however is highly differentiated. As such, the product has expanded to key regional retailers on both the East and West coasts, a major convenience retailer in Canada, and a major national grocery retailer in the United States. Aspen Pure competes in the premium bottled water category. According to Transparency International, global bottled water sales reached $198 Billion in 2017 and experienced a compound annual growth rate 6.4%
  
  Búcha Live Kombucha
  
  Búcha Live Kombucha (“Búcha”) is a certified-organic, all-natural, non-GMO, non-HFCS, fermented Kombucha tea with more than two billion CFU’s in every serving.
  
  Búcha is produced with a unique and proprietary manufacturing process that eliminates the common vinegary aftertaste associated with many other Kombucha’s and provides the brand with an industry leading twelve-month shelf life as compared to the typical 90-day shelf life of our competitors’ products. The production process also leads to consistency and stability with no risk of secondary fermentation, secondary alcohol production, incremental sugar production or over-carbonation, and is one of the world’s first Kombucha’s that is shelf-stable (no refrigeration required) with no degradation to flavor or the probiotics organisms in every serving.
 
  Búcha is made from black teas, proprietary kombucha culture and probiotics, unique yeast strains and cultures, and all-natural organic fruits and flavors. Búcha comes in five flavors including Raspberry Pomegranate, Blood Orange, Guava Mango, Grapefruit Sage, and Yuzu Lemon packaged in 16 oz glass bottles. The brand is sold at major grocery retail across the United States and Canada. Because Búcha is shelf stable and has 12 months of shelf life, the brand has recently been able to expand internationally and to major convenience retail. The Kombucha category is the fastest growing segment in the beverage industry with CAGR of 41% since 2012 and annual revenues of $1.48 Billion according to Zion Market Research and Beverage Industry Magazine.
  
  Coco-Libre
  
  Coco-Libre is an organic, 100% coconut water produced at the source. The brand is one of the top 5 brands in the coconut water category and the leading brand in multi-serve sizes. Coco-Libre is distributed in more than 15,000 outlets throughout the United States and Canada, and has excellent presence in the natural channel. The brand comes in 1 liter sizes, 330 ml tetra-pak, and 500 ml cans in both regular and natural fruit flavored varieties.
  
  In late 2017, we switched Coco-Libre from being produced from concentrate in the US, to being produced at the source from 100% organic pure coconut water. With this shift, we gained some significant benefits including:
  
   1)
 A more preferred consumer proposition “not from concentrate”

   2)
 Significantly improved flavor profile resulting from the young coastal coconut base

   3)
 Lower cost of goods sold by more than 30%

   4)
 New more preferred consumer packaging options differentiated vs. other’s tetra-paks

 
  Coco-Libre competes in the approximately $2.5 billion coconut water category that has experienced a compound annual growth rate of over 20% over the past 5 years, and is the second fastest growth segment in the non-alcoholic beverage category according to Beverage Business Insights.
  
 
  Coco-Libre Sparkling
  
  Coco-Libre Sparkling was launched in December 2017 and has already gained 6,897 points of distribution in 1,919 outlets. The product is produced at the source, is made with only pure young coastal coconut water and natural fruits, and contains no added sugar. The brand has 30 to 40 calories total depending on the variety and comes Coconut Lime, Coastal Coconut, Coconut Mangosteen Passion, Coconut Watermelon, and Coconut Peach Pear flavor combinations.
  
  Coco-Libre Sparkling sources revenue from other sparkling waters, which is a large fast growing segment, and from other still coconut waters. The brand has the lightness and crispness of a sparkling water, but is produced from coconut water instead of municipal tap water like other leading sparkling water brands.
  
  Coco-Libre Protein
  
  Coco-Libre Protein competes in the meal replacement category, one of the fast emerging segments in the non-alcoholic beverage category. Coco-Libre Protein is being redeveloped to become a complete meal replacement, vs. its historic coconut water with merely added protein.
  
  According to Statista, the meal replacement segment is estimated to be $3.7 billion in annual revenue with a CAGR of 7.1% since 2011.

The Marley brand is a globally relevant lifestyle brand with excellent social media presence, enjoying more than 72 million loyal Facebook followers and loyal Marley fans.
 Marley yerba Mate
  
  Organic Marley Mate was launched in November 2017, exclusively with a major convenience store chain initially across three of their divisions. Marley Mate is a tea/coffee/natural energy drink hybrid that has the taste of a tea, the uplifting benefits of coffee or an energy drink, but without any crash and without any of the increasingly negatively viewed ingredients in energy drinks. The brand is organic, very clean label with only Marley Mate 30-40 calories, and has quickly become the number two player nationally in the category, despite being in limited distribution.
  
  Marley Mate comes in four flavors including Be Jammin Berry, One Love Lemon, Jamaican Me Mango, and Ya Mon Mint. The brand has met with excellent early success in its initial markets since launch, outselling major competitors in each of its initial launch markets.
  
  Marley Mate competes in the rapidly emerging yerba mate segment of the tea/coffee/energy drink category. The segment is estimated to be around $300 million in revenue.
  
  Marley Cold Brew
  
  Marley Cold Brew was developed in late 2017, harmonized with the rest of the new Marley branding family, gained commitment for national distribution with a major convenience channel customer, and is expanding in full launch in Q2 2018. The segment at retail is very new with retailers still learning about pull through rates and sustainable consumer demand. The segment however has been growing at the expense of other high caloric Frappuccino-type beverages, and differentiates with more real and less acidic or bitter taste that a regular RTD coffee.
  
  Cold Brew as a segment has grown 580% from 2011 to 2016 to comprise a significant growth part of the $55billion global RTD coffee market according to Mintel.
  
  Marley One Drop

  Marley Mellow Mood relaxation drinks compete in the approximately $50 billion Global RTD tea market, which has experienced a compound annual growth rate over the past five years of just under 10%. Marley is the leading relaxation drink, which is a developing sub-segment of the RTD category.
  
  Marley Mellow Mood® relaxation drinks are distributed in more than 10,000 outlets throughout the United States and Canada, and has an initial presence in 7 international markets in Western Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean.
  
  New Age Health Sciences Division
  
 We established our Health Sciences Division in the third quarter of 2017, as a separate standalone company and wholly-owned subsidiary after the acquisition of the Premier Micronutrient Corporation. The acquisition came with 11 patents that have since been added to, now totaling 13, on which significant cooperative research studies and human and animal trials have been completed. The patents and human need states that are addressed by the technologies were all developed in partnership with and funded by the U.S. government, with more than $30 million invested by them. New Age now owns all the intellectual property, significantly differentiating it from other beverage companies. Our intention is to convert the patents into products, with direct functionality in protection, treatment, or improvement of different consumer need states.
  
 We have decided to pursue four main areas of focus where we believe we have the most robust science and patent protection on which we intend to commercialize products including Rehydration/Recovery, Radiation protection, Neural Protection/Improvement, and Cardiovascular health. We also intend to either license or outsource any patent we do not intend to commercialize. The Company believes that the intellectual property portfolio is of substantial value to either pharmaceutical or beverage companies, given the quality and uniqueness of the patents, and the science and evidence on the efficacy of the technologies.
  
  ‘nHanced
  
  ‘nHanced is our first product that was developed by the medical and scientific team at New Age Health Sciences. ‘nHanced delivers a first of its kind, product which is specifically designed to improve patient outcomes after surgery. It is an all-natural, clear carbohydrate beverage for use up to two hours prior to surgery patients and hospital systems adopting ERAS surgical protocols. The product utilizes the same superior carbohydrate source that we use in our Coco-libre coconut water, includes key vitamins and mineral co-factors for immune support, and provides antioxidants, amino acids and phytonutrients for improved metabolic function.
  
  New Age has the insight that a preoperative carbohydrate dose with specific fluid volume has multiple health benefits for a person undergoing surgery. This insight, coupled our data on the positive benefits of micronutrients, led to the formulation of ‘nHanced to provide facilitate recovery after surgery. with less inflammatory response, less nausea, reduced gastric stress, increased GI motility, less insulin resistance, improved wound healing and immune function, and overall improved patient satisfaction. Initial patient testing has validated the benefits.
  
  Bio-Shield
  
  “Bio-Shield” is the current working brand name for our radiation protection product. We believe that we own the patents to the only product in the world proven to protect the body from the effects of ionizing radiation, and have the trails and research studies validating the efficacy of our product. Ionizing radiation, which comes from a number of sources, including near proximity to sun, nuclear facilities, medical X-rays or scans, affect the body by breaking the double strands of DNA inside the body. New Age’s product has proven to protect double-strand DNA from breaking from the impact of radiation.
  
  We intend to launch “Bio-Shield” in Asia Pacific in 2018, and thereafter expect to other markets and channels including both the travel and medical channels.
  
  ‘nHanced addresses a market segment size of more than 320 million surgeries a year, 25% of which are associated with complications.
  
  PediaAde
  
  PediaAde was developed in the fourth quarter of 2017 and tested in limited distribution. Full expansion is expected in 2018 in key grocery and pharmacy outlets in the U.S. We believe PediaAde delivers superior rehydration to competitive rehydration products, due in part to production using the same superior carbohydrate and electrolyte source found in our Coco-Libre brand. PediaAde has only 25 total calories, is all-natural, and has no harmful ingredients, like red dye #40 and others found in competitors.

  Competitive Strengths
  
  New Age has five components of differentiation that distinguishes it from other companies competing in the beverage industry:
  
 
1) | New Age has a unique business platform with its own Direct Store Delivery ("DSD") distribution. This platform enables the Company to have the infrastructure and resources to operate a profitable beverage business. Most if not all beverage companies under $100 million in scale struggle because of the overhead and costs to operate in the sector. New Age, with its cash generative DSD operation, can spread its overhead across a much larger base, providing the resources to allocate to brand building and expansion in a way few if any other small cap beverage companies can. Our DSD distribution group in Colorado includes almost 40 unique routes, with a >20 person sales team, and a >20 person merchandising team, covering more than 6,000 outlets for more than 60 brands and more than 600 SKU’s. The DSD arm of our business is a test bed for new products before national rollout, provides an early indicator system for any new emerging competitive brands or beverage segments, and gives the group near captive control of the shelf space across the 6,000 outlets the group services. The scale that the DSD system represents, coupled with the efficient cash conversion of the type of operation, provides the resources and infrastructure base to facilitate expansion and diversification to higher margin beverages sold globally in traditional and new higher margin channels. The combination provides the potential for superior free cash flow and net income generation in a way that would be very difficult for other smaller beverage companies to achieve. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | New Age has a full brand portfolio competing in only the growth segments of the industry, and as such is the only one-stop-shop supplier of healthy beverages for retailers and distributors. These entities are reticent to work with smaller, individual brand companies without the resources and infrastructure to support them. New Age’s portfolio of healthy brands enables the Company to pursue the strategic high ground of “world’s leading healthy functional beverage company,” filling the void created by the legacy leaders in the industry. Not only does the Company enjoy the growth rate benefits of the segments in which it competes, but by focusing exclusively on healthy alternatives, it limits its distractions and required investments to maintain businesses in declining segments like juice or carbonated soft drinks for example that many of its competitors are forced to continue. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | New Age has a strong distribution in major key accounts across the US that has near doubled in the past six-months. We have insights that this “distribution presence” supports development of “brand preference,” and provides a stable and sustainable revenue platform. New Age has also recently structured preferred partnerships with major distributors to penetrate new and alternative channels, and believes it has first mover advantage with them to take advantage of significant growth in these segments. The Company has spent the past 10 years developing a national hybrid distribution network with other major DSD operators, natural channel distributors, and direct to store wholesale distribution. The Company’s national network represents a significant competitive advantage and barrier to entry vs. many other smaller beverage companies. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | The Company has financial flexibility with a strong balance sheet, de minimis debt, and access to the capital markets unlike many other private or small public beverage entities. New Age has historically enjoyed a low cost of capital relative to its peer group by virtue of its line of credit at libor plus 2 established with US Bank in 2016. That line, coupled with its ability to access the capital markets up to $100 million via its S-3 facility established in October 2017 to facilitate major acquisitions or provide capital for significant organic growth opportunities, provides the firm with an unprecedented ability and significant optionality to intelligently support its growth. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5) | New Age has the organizational capabilities and systems unlike other small beverage companies., defined as having the people, processes, systems, information, and culture/environment to drive superior, sustainable, profitable growth, New Age’s senior leadership team has collectively more than 100 years of beverage industry experience and experience working in both major multinationals and smaller beverage companies. The Company’s board of directors brings global strategic leadership experience gleaned from running highly successful major multinational companies in the beverage, retail, and other industries. From a process standpoint, New Age has dedicated daily, weekly, monthly and annual routines, by and through which it runs the operation. The Company recently employed Microsoft dynamics and Encompass ERP systems, and has an internal target setting system whereby every associate in the firm has specific metrics cascaded from the Company’s annual business plan. New Age has also developed its own proprietary dashboards to augment its access to syndicated data and industry information, and employed a culture of ownership and environment of accountability and that is metric driven and performance oriented. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
 As a result of the Company’s strengths, three competitive advantages are emerging including an ability to drive superior organic growth on its core portfolio, an ability to profitably acquire and integrate new companies and brands, and an ability to develop new breakthrough products organically leveraging its R&D and scientific and medical expertise.
  
  Reliance on Third Party Suppliers and Distributors
  
  We rely on various suppliers for the raw and packaging materials, production, sale and distribution of our products. Our third party distribution providers are for certain areas of the country that are outside of our owned DSD distribution network. The material terms of these relationships are typically annually negotiated and include pricing, quality standards, delivery times and conditions, purchase orders, and payment terms. Payment terms are typically net 30, meaning that the total invoiced amount is expected to be paid in full within 30 days from when the date on which the products or services are provided. We believe that we have sufficient options for each of our raw and packaging material needs, as well as our third party distribution needs and also have long term relationships with each of our suppliers and distributors, resulting in consistency in quality and supply. We also believe that we have sufficient breadth of retail relationships with distribution in both large and small retailers and independents and across multiple channels (mass, club, pharmacies, convenience, and small and large format retailers) throughout the United States.
  
 The contractual arrangements with all third parties, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers are typical of the beverage industry with standard terms. We have no long-term obligations with any of the third parties nor do any of them have long-term obligations with us. The third party supplier, manufacturing and distribution agreements were entered into in the normal course of business within the guidelines of industry practices and are not deemed material and definite.

  Significant Customers
  
 We have significantly diversified our retail distribution base over the past 18 months to minimize customer concentration and risk with any one customer. For the year ended December 31, 2017, three customers represented approximately 21.4% (9.9%, 6.3% and 5.2%) of net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, three customers represented approximately 27.5% (14.5%, 7.5% and 5.5%) of net revenues. As of December 31, 2017, three customers represented 23.1% (10.5%, 6.7% and 5.9%) of accounts receivables. As of December 31, 2016, three customers represented approximately 24.9% (12.3%, 8.9% and 8.2%) of accounts receivable.
 Growth Strategies
  
 Our long-term objective is to become the leading healthy beverage company. We believe that by focusing on our purpose, which is to make a difference for consumers with healthier beverages, and by flawlessly executing our business plan, that we can achieve that objective. Based on available information, we believe we are one of the top 20 healthy beverage companies worldwide today, and the 58th largest non-alcoholic beverage company overall. We intend to achieve our goal by driving organic growth behind our existing portfolio of healthy functional beverages, in all relevant packages and product formats, across all major retail channels, in all major markets, through an aligned network of retailer and distributor partners.
  
 Our key growth strategies include the following:
  
 – Build core brands with new products in emerging growth segments
  
 – Drive key account distribution and in-store merchandising
  
 – Penetrate new channels, markets and segments
  
 – Expand gross and adjusted EBITDA margins
 
 – Build metric-driven, performance oriented, culture of ownership and accountability
   
  Sales and Marketing
  
 We currently have an in-house sales and merchandising team consisting of approximately 75 individuals based in Colorado and throughout the United States, whose compensation is highly variable and highly performance-based. Each sales person has individual targets for increasing “base” volume through distribution expansion, and “incremental” volume through promotions and other in-store merchandising and display activity. As distribution to new major customers, new major channels, or new major markets increases, we will expand the sales and marketing team on a variable basis.
  
 We market our products using a range of marketing mediums including in-store merchandising and promotions, experiential marketing, events, and sponsorships, digital marketing and social media, direct marketing, and traditional media including print, radio, outdoor, and TV.

  Distribution 
  
  Our products are currently distributed in 10 countries internationally, and in 50 states domestically through a hybrid of four routes to market including our own DSD system that reaches more than 6,000 outlets, and to more than 35,000 outlets throughout the United States directly through customer’s warehouses, through our network of DSD partners, and through our network of brokers and natural product distributors. Our products are sold through multiple channels including major grocery retail, natural food retail, specialty outlets, hypermarkets, club stores, pharmacies, convenience stores and gas stations.
  
 Our sales strategy is to distribute our products worldwide through to consumers in the most cost effect manner possible. We sell our products direct to consumers through our own Ecommerce system and other Ecommerce systems, through retail customers across grocery, gas, convenience, pharmacy, mass, club and other channels, to major foodservice customers, to alternative channel customers including juice/smoothie shops, military, office, and health club, and through hospitals, outpatient doctor offices, and other channels.
  
 The diversification of our channels and distributors, similar to the diversification of retail customer base, is expected to minimize distributor and channel concentration and risk, but is also expected have a very positive margin mix effect, and a very positive incremental volume impact, with the combination of International, Ecommerce, Foodservice, and Health Sciences expected to exceed 15% of total revenue in 2018, from a negligible base in 2017.
  
  Research and Development Activities
  
 Our research and development efforts are focused on two primary paths. The first is to continually review our existing formulas and production processes and structure to evaluate opportunities for cost of goods sold improvements, without degrading the quality or fundamentally changing the consumer appeal taste profile of our existing products. The second major research and development effort is in the development of fundamentally new and differentiated products, based on consumer insights and trends and competitive intensity in those segments. The Company’s mission to only provide healthy functional beverages governs our development efforts.
  
  The Company’s new products and R&D efforts in its Health Sciences Division, are science-backed by the patents, cooperative research studies and human and animal trails acquired from the Premier Micronutrient Corporation. They are targeted toward to fundamental human needs states, segments that do not yet exist in beverages, but do exist in the pharmaceutical arena, and opportunities where New Age can gain first mover advantage. The Company’s mission is to only provide healthy functional beverages with real efficacy for consumers. That guiding principle of “no compromise” governs all our development efforts.
  
  Seasonality
  
 We experience some seasonality whereby the peak summer months show a higher level of sales and consumption. However, the structure of our business and range of products in our portfolio mitigate any major fluctuations. Our revenue during the second and third quarters of the year have historically been approximately 60% of annual revenue, and this seasonality is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.
 Competition
  
 The beverage industry, specifically the healthy beverage industry, is highly competitive. We face intense competition from very large, international corporations, as well as from local and national companies. In addition, we face competition from well-known companies that have large market share.
  
 The intensity of competition in the future is expected to increase and no assurance can be provided that we can sustain our market position or expand our business.
  
 Many of our current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational resources, and name recognition than we have. However, we believe that with our diverse product line, consisting of kombucha tea, green tea, water and energy beverages, it will give us the ability to obtain a large market share, and continue to generate sales and compete in the industry.

 Any encroachment upon our proprietary information, including the unauthorized use of our brand name, the use of a similar name by a competing company or a lawsuit initiated either by us or against us for infringement upon proprietary information or improper use of a trademark or patent, may affect our ability to create brand name recognition, cause customer confusion and/or have a detrimental effect on our business due to the cost of defending any potential litigation related to infringement. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. or International Patent and Trademark Offices may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and/or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation or adverse proceeding could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could seriously harm our business operations and/or results of operations.
 Government and Industry Regulation
  
 We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. These laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture, safety, labeling, transportation, advertising and sale of our products. Violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacture, safety, labeling, transportation and advertising of our products could damage our reputation and/or result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties. For example, changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on our beverages and our ingredients could increase our costs. Regulatory focus on the health, safety and marketing of beverage products is increasing. Certain federal or state regulations or laws affecting the labeling of our products, such as California’s “Prop 65,” which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects, are or could become applicable to our products. At this time, our products do not require government approval, but as federal or state laws change, the manufacture or quality of our products may become subject to additional regulation.
  
 We are also subject to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Washington and Colorado Corporation Law. We will also be subject to common business and tax rules and regulations pertaining to the operation of our business, such as the United States Internal Revenue Tax Code and the Washington and Colorado State Tax Codes, as well as international tax codes and shipping tariffs. We will also be subject to proprietary regulations such as United States Trademark and Patent Law as it applies to the intellectual property of third parties. We believe that the effects of existing or probable governmental regulations will be additional responsibilities of management to ensure that we are in compliance with securities regulations as they apply to our products as well as ensuring that we do not infringe on any proprietary rights of others with respect to our products. We will also need to maintain accurate financial records in order to remain compliant with securities regulations as well as any corporate tax liability we incur.
