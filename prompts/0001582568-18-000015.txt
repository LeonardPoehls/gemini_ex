Overview
PBFX is a fee-based, growth-oriented, Delaware master limited partnership formed in February 2013 by subsidiaries of PBF Energy Inc. and its indirect subsidiary, PBF Logistics GP LLC (“PBF GP”), our general partner, to own or lease, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products terminals, pipelines, storage facilities and similar logistics assets. PBF GP is our general partner and is wholly-owned by PBF Energy Company LLC (“PBF LLC”). PBF Energy Inc. is the sole managing member of PBF LLC and as of December 31, 2017 owned 96.7% of the total economic interest in PBF LLC. We refer you to “Organizational Structure” below for an illustration of our relationship with PBF Energy Inc. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to “PBF Energy” refer collectively to PBF Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries, other than PBFX and its subsidiaries, and our general partner. On May 14, 2014, PBFX completed its initial public offering of 15,812,500 common units (including 2,062,500 common units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option) (the “Offering”). PBFX’s common units trade on the NYSE under the symbol “PBFX.” As of December 31, 2017, PBF LLC held a 44.1% limited partner interest in PBFX, a non-economic general partner interest and owns all of PBFX’s IDRs, with the remaining 55.9% limited partner interest held by public unitholders.

The Partnership includes the assets, liabilities and results of operations of certain crude oil, refined products, natural gas and intermediates terminaling, pipeline and storage assets, which include assets previously operated and owned by subsidiaries of PBF Holding Company LLC (“PBF Holding”), Delaware City Refining Company LLC (“DCR”), Toledo Refining Company LLC (“TRC”) and PBF Holding’s previously held subsidiaries, Delaware Pipeline Company LLC (“DPC”), Torrance Valley Pipeline Company LLC (“TVPC”) and Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline Company LLC (“PNGPC”), which were acquired in a series of transactions with PBF LLC. The Partnership, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, PBFX Operating Company LLC (“PBFX Op Co”), owns a 50% equity interest in TVPC, with the remaining 50% equity interest in TVPC owned by TVP Holding Company LLC (“TVP Holding”), a subsidiary of PBF Holding.

2017 Business Developments
Senior Notes Offering
On October 6, 2017, we issued $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “new 2023 Notes”). The new 2023 Notes were issued under the indenture governing the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2023 issued on May 12, 2015 (the “initial 2023 Notes,” together with the new 2023 Notes, the “2023 Notes”). The new 2023 Notes were issued at 102% of face value with an effective rate of 6.442%. The new 2023 Notes are expected to be treated as a single series with the initial 2023 Notes and will have the same terms as those initial notes except that (i) the new 2023 Notes are subject to a separate registration rights agreement and (ii) the new 2023 Notes will be issued initially under CUSIP numbers different from the initial 2023 Notes. We used the net proceeds from the offering of the new 2023 Notes to repay a portion of our five-year $360.0 million revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) and for general partnership purposes. 
Expiration of Subordination Period
On June 1, 2017, the requirements under our partnership agreement for the conversion of all subordinated units into common units were satisfied and the subordination period ended. As a result, each of our 15,886,553 outstanding subordinated units converted on a one-for-one basis into common units and began participating pro rata with the other common units in distributions of available cash. The conversion did not impact the amount of the cash distribution paid or the total number of our outstanding units representing limited partner interests. Refer to Notes 7 “Equity” and 9 “Net Income per Unit” in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Toledo Products Terminal Acquisition 
On April 17, 2017, our wholly-owned subsidiary, PBF Logistics Products Terminals LLC (“PLPT”), acquired the Toledo, Ohio refined products terminal assets (the “Toledo Products Terminal”) from Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million plus working capital (the “Toledo Products Terminal Acquisition”). The Toledo Products Terminal is directly connected to, and currently supplied by, PBF Holding’s Toledo Refinery. The Toledo Products Terminal is comprised of a ten-bay truck rack and over 110,000 barrels of chemicals, clean product and additive storage capacity. 
PNGPC Acquisition 
On February 28, 2017, we closed the transaction contemplated by the contribution agreement entered into with PBF LLC dated as of February 15, 2017 (the “PNGPC Contribution Agreement”). Pursuant to the PNGPC Contribution Agreement, our wholly-owned subsidiary, PBFX Op Co, acquired from PBF LLC all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of PNGPC (the “PNGPC Acquisition”). PNGPC owns and operates an existing interstate natural gas pipeline, which is subject to regulation by the FERC, and in connection with the PNGPC Acquisition, we constructed a new 24” pipeline to replace the existing pipeline, which commenced services in August 2017 (the “Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline”). In consideration for the PNGPC limited liability company interests, we delivered to PBF LLC (i) an $11.6 million intercompany promissory note in favor of Paulsboro Refining Company LLC (“PRC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of PBF Holding (the “Affiliate Note Payable”), (ii) an expansion rights and right of first refusal agreement in favor of PBF LLC with respect to the Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline and (iii) an assignment and assumption agreement with respect to certain outstanding litigation involving PNGPC and the existing pipeline. This acquisition is accounted for as a transfer of assets between entities under common control under GAAP. Refer to Note 3 “Acquisitions” in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further discussion regarding the PNGPC Acquisition.

As a result of the completion of the Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2017, we fully repaid the Affiliate Note Payable and related accrued interest.
Chalmette Storage Services Agreement
On February 15, 2017, PBF Holding and PBFX Op Co entered into a ten-year storage services agreement (the “Chalmette Storage Services Agreement”) under which we, through PBFX Op Co, began providing storage services to PBF Holding commencing on November 1, 2017 upon the completion of the construction of a new crude tank with a shell capacity of 625,000 barrels at PBF Holding’s Chalmette Refinery (the “Chalmette Storage Tank”). PBFX Op Co and Chalmette Refining, L.L.C. (“Chalmette Refining”) entered into a twenty-year lease for the premises upon which the tank is located (the “Lease”) and a project management agreement (the “Project Management Agreement”) pursuant to which Chalmette Refining managed the construction of the tank. The Lease can be extended by PBFX Op Co for two additional ten-year periods. Under the Chalmette Storage Services Agreement, PBFX provides PBF Holding with storage services in return for storage fees. The storage services require PBFX to accept, redeliver and store all products tendered by PBF Holding in the tank and PBF Holding pays a monthly fee of $0.60 per barrel of shell capacity. The Chalmette Storage Services Agreement can be extended by PBF Holding for two additional five-year periods.
Principles of Combination and Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The financial statements presented in “Item 6. Selected Financial Data” in this Form 10-K include the consolidated financial results of PBF MLP Predecessor, our predecessor for accounting purposes (our “Predecessor”), for periods presented through May 13, 2014, and the consolidated financial results of PBFX for the period beginning May 14, 2014, the date of the Offering. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 presents solely the consolidated financial position of PBFX. We recorded the Acquisitions from PBF (as defined below) at PBF Energy’s historical book value, as the Acquisitions from PBF were treated as a reorganization of entities under common control. We have retrospectively adjusted the financial information of our Predecessor and PBFX contained herein to include the historical results of the DCR West Rack, Toledo Storage Facility, the DCR Products Pipeline and Truck Rack, the Torrance Valley Pipeline (all as defined below) and the Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline prior to the effective date of each transaction. 
Our Predecessor did not historically operate its assets for the purpose of generating revenues independent of other PBF Energy businesses that we support, with the exception of the DCR Products Pipeline (as defined below). In connection with the closing of the Offering and each of the Acquisitions from PBF, we entered into commercial and service agreements with subsidiaries of PBF Energy under which we operate our assets for the purpose of generating fee-based revenues. We receive, handle and transfer crude oil, refined products and natural gas from sources located throughout the U.S. and Canada and store crude oil, refined products and intermediates for PBF Energy in support of its refineries. 
Since we do not own any of the crude oil, refined products or natural gas that we handle nor engage in the trading of crude oil, refined products or natural gas, we have minimal direct exposure to risks associated with commodity price fluctuations. However, these risks indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long term through their effects on our customer’s operations. A substantial majority of our revenue is derived from PBF Energy under various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements that generally include MVCs.
The Partnership is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes or the income taxes of those states that follow the federal income tax treatment of partnerships. Instead, for purposes of these income taxes, each partner of the Partnership is required to take into account his, her or its share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction in computing his, her or its federal and state income tax liabilities, regardless of whether cash distributions are made to such partner by the Partnership. The taxable income reportable to each partner takes into account differences between the tax basis and fair market value of PBFX’s assets, the acquisition price of such partner’s 
6

units and the taxable income allocation requirements under the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (our “partnership agreement”).

Omnibus Agreement 
At the closing of the Offering, we entered into an omnibus agreement with PBF GP, PBF LLC and PBF Holding, which has been amended and restated in connection with certain of the Acquisitions from PBF (as amended, the “Omnibus Agreement”) for the provision of executive management services and support for accounting and finance, legal, human resources, information technology, environmental, health and safety, and other administrative functions, as well as (i) PBF LLC’s agreement not to compete with us under certain circumstances, subject to certain exceptions, (ii) our right of first offer for ten years to acquire certain logistics assets retained by PBF Energy following the Offering, including certain logistics assets that PBF LLC or its subsidiaries may construct or acquire in the future, subject to certain exceptions, and (iii) a license to use the PBF Logistics trademark and name.
The annual fee was increased to $6.9 million effective as of January 1, 2017. 
Services Agreement
In connection with the Offering, we entered into an operation and management services and secondment agreement with PBF Holding and certain of its subsidiaries, pursuant to which PBF Holding and its subsidiaries provide us with the personnel necessary for us to perform our obligations under our commercial agreements. We reimburse PBF Holding for the use of such employees and the provision of certain infrastructure-related services to the extent applicable to its operations, including storm water discharge and waste water treatment, steam, potable water, access to certain roads and grounds, sanitary sewer access, electrical power, emergency response, filter press, fuel gas, API solids treatment, fire water and compressed air. 
On February 28, 2017, we entered into the Fifth Amended and Restated Operation and Management Services and Secondment Agreement (as amended, the “Services Agreement”) in connection with the PNGPC Acquisition resulting in an increase to the annual fee to $6.7 million. The Services Agreement will terminate upon the termination of the Omnibus Agreement, provided that we may terminate any service on 30-days’ notice. 
Chalmette Lease and Project Management Agreement
In connection with the Chalmette Storage Services Agreement, PBFX Op Co and Chalmette Refining entered into the Lease and the Project Management Agreement, which expired upon the completion of the Chalmette Storage Tank. The Lease has a twenty-year term and can be extended by PBFX Op Co for two additional ten-year periods.
Properties
Our principal properties are described above in “Assets and Operations” under the captions “Transportation and Terminaling Segment” and “Storage Segment.” We believe that our properties and facilities are adequate for our operations and that our facilities are adequately maintained. Our corporate office is located in the same office as PBF Energy. PBF Energy leases approximately 58,000 square feet for its principal corporate offices in Parsippany, New Jersey. The lease for PBF Energy’s principal corporate offices expires in 2019. Functions performed in the Parsippany office include overall corporate management, refinery and health, safety and environmental  
13

management, planning and strategy, corporate finance, commercial operations, logistics, contract administration, marketing, investor relations, governmental affairs, accounting, tax, treasury, information technology, legal and human resources support functions. 
Additionally, we lease approximately 5,000 square feet for our regional corporate office in The Woodlands, Texas. The lease for The Woodlands office expires in 2022. Functions performed in The Woodlands include pipeline control center operations and logistics operations, engineering and regulatory support functions.
Under the Contribution Agreements, PBF Energy, through certain of its subsidiaries, indemnifies us for certain environmental liabilities associated with the ownership and operation of the Contributed Assets arising at or before the closing of the Offering and the Acquisitions from PBF. See “Environmental Regulations, Environmental Liabilities” below for a more detailed discussion of PBF Energy’s indemnification obligations.
Competition
As a result of our contractual relationship with PBF Energy and our direct connection to all of its refineries, we believe that our terminals, pipelines and storage facilities will not face significant competition from other terminals, pipelines and storage facilities for PBF Energy’s transportation and storage requirements with respect to the services provided under our commercial agreements.
If PBF Energy reduces its purchases of crude oil shipped via rail or truck, PBF Energy may only receive the minimum volumes through our crude oil unloading terminals (or pay the shortfall payment if it does not receive the minimum volumes), which may cause a decrease in our revenues. PBF Energy may elect to ship crude oil to its refineries via pipeline or through its refinery marine facilities, which PBFX does not own, as an alternative mode of crude oil transportation. PBF Energy competes with integrated petroleum companies, which have their own crude oil storage, supplies and distribution and marketing systems, as well as with independent refiners, many of which also have their own storage, distribution and marketing systems. PBF Energy also competes with other suppliers that purchase refined petroleum products for resale. Competition in any particular geographic area is affected significantly by the volume of products produced by refineries in that area and by the availability of products and the cost of transportation to that area from distant refineries.
The East Coast Terminals compete with other terminal facilities, in terms of fees, and other qualitative factors, including those affiliated with integrated petroleum companies. Competition related to the East Coast Terminals is affected significantly by the volume of products produced, transported and available in the geographic area and the cost to transport products from distant locations.
Safety and Maintenance
We perform preventive and normal maintenance on all of our facilities and make repairs and replacements when necessary or appropriate. We also conduct routine and required inspections of those assets in accordance with good industry practices and as required by regulation.
Our terminal, pipeline and storage facilities have response plans, spill prevention and control plans, and other programs designed to effectively respond to emergencies. Our East Coast Terminals and Toledo Truck Terminal are protected with fire protection systems that are actuated either by sensors or an emergency switch. We continually strive to maintain compliance with applicable air, solid waste, and wastewater regulations.
Our pipelines are subject to strict safety laws and regulations for the transportation of crude oil and petroleum products. Transportation involves a risk that hazardous liquids may be released into the environment, which could cause harm to the public or the environment. The DOT has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection and management of pipeline assets, which affect our pipelines. These regulations contain requirements for pipeline integrity management programs, which include the inspection, testing and maintenance or repairs of the pipelines. The DOT regulations also require pipeline operation and 
14

maintenance personnel to meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans. We believe that we are in compliance with all of the DOT’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration regulations on pipeline safety. 
Employee Safety
We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state, and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.
Insurance
Terminals and storage facilities may experience damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. We maintain insurance and/or are insured under the property, liability and business interruption policies of PBF Energy and/or certain of its subsidiaries, subject to the deductibles and limits applicable to us, which we believe are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances to cover our operations and assets. However, such insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our assets, and we cannot ensure that such insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal and property damage, or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices. As we continue to grow, we will continue to monitor limits and retentions under our policies and those of PBF Energy and/or its subsidiaries as they relate to the overall cost and scope of our insurance program.
Terminal and Pipeline Control Operations
Our terminals, facilities and pipelines are generally automated, but continuously supervised by either our employees (including our employees located at The Woodlands office), PBF Energy employees or a third party with oversight by PBF Energy or our employees. At the terminals, our customers’ truck drivers are provided with security badges or other credentials to access and use these facilities. In addition, individual trucks are required to be registered in either PBF Energy’s system, or ours, to ensure that required regulatory inspections are maintained by either PBF Energy’s customers, or their common carriers, or our customers.

The Endangered Species Act restricts certain activities that may affect endangered species or their environments. While some of our facilities are in areas that may be designated as habitats for endangered species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the Endangered Species Act. However, the discovery of previously unidentified endangered species or habitats could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating limitations or bans in the affected area.
Environmental Liabilities
Contaminations resulting from spills of crude oil or petroleum products are not unusual within the petroleum terminaling or transportation industries. Historic spills at truck and rail racks and terminals, as a result of past operations, have resulted in contamination of the environment, including soils and groundwater.

Pursuant to the Contribution Agreements entered into in connection with the Offering and the Acquisitions from PBF, PBF Energy has agreed to indemnify us for certain known and unknown environmental liabilities that are based on conditions in existence at our Predecessor’s properties and associated with the ownership or operation of the Contributed Assets and arising from the conditions that existed prior to the closings of the Offering and the Acquisitions from PBF. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify PBF Energy for (i) certain events and conditions associated with the ownership or operation of our assets that occur, as applicable, after the closing of the each Acquisition from PBF (including the Offering), and (ii) environmental liabilities related to our assets if the environmental liability is the result of the negligence, willful misconduct or criminal conduct of us or our employees, including those seconded to us. As a result, we may incur environmental expenses in the future, which may be substantial.
In connection with the acquisition of the East Coast Terminals, the Partnership is responsible for the environmental remediation costs for conditions that existed on the closing date up to a maximum of $250,000 per year for ten years, with Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. remaining responsible for any and all additional costs above such amounts during such period.
As of December 31, 2017, we have recorded a total liability related to environmental remediation costs of $2.2 million related to the acquisitions of the East Coast Terminals and the Torrance Valley Pipeline. Refer to Note 10 “Commitments and Contingencies” in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
Seasonality
The crude oil, refined products and natural gas throughput and stored at our facilities are affected by the level of supply and demand for crude oil, refined products and natural gas in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. However, many effects of seasonality on our revenues will be substantially mitigated due to our commercial agreements with PBF Energy that include MVCs that are constant each calendar quarter or year. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employ 39 employees at our East Coast Terminals, at our Toledo Products Terminal and in The Woodlands office. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, PLPT, we employ 29 employees located at the East Coast Terminals and 5 employees that are located at the Toledo Products Terminal. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, PBFX Op Co, we employ 5 employees in The Woodlands office. 
 Of the 29 employees at our East Coast Terminals, 10 are covered by a collective bargaining agreement through the USW. We consider our relations with the represented employees to be satisfactory. The agreements with the USW covering the East Coast Terminals are scheduled to expire in April 2021. 
All of our executive management personnel are currently employees of PBF Energy or subsidiaries of PBF Energy and devote a portion of their time to our business and affairs that is required to manage and conduct our operations. The other personnel that conduct our operations are employees of PBF Holding or its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement, we pay an annual fee to PBF Energy for the provision of various centralized administrative services and reimburse PBF Energy for direct or allocated costs and expenses incurred by PBF Energy on our behalf. Pursuant to the Services Agreement, we use employees of PBF Energy to operate certain of our assets and PBF Energy is reimbursed for such employees through an annual fee, which also includes provisions of certain utilities and other infrastructure-related services. Please read “Agreements with PBF Energy.”
In addition, PBF Energy and its affiliates have entered into a rail operations services agreement with Savage, an unaffiliated third party, to provide crude oil unloading and other operations services for the Delaware City Refinery. Under the rail operations services agreement, Savage is responsible for providing the personnel necessary for the performance of our operations services. Savage is at all times considered an independent contractor

and none of Savage’s employees or contractors are considered an employee, representative or agent of DCR or of us. The costs of Savage’s services provided to us are passed through to us by PBF Holding and its subsidiaries. From time to time, certain other third parties may provide operating services to us in a capacity as independent contractors.
