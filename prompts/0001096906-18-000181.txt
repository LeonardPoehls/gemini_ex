Item 1.  Business
Reorganization Agreement
 
On September 6, 2016, the Company and BlackRidge Technology Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("BlackRidge") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Reorganization Agreement") originally dated as of September 6, 2016, and amended on February 22, 2017 to update the number of common shares, warrants, and options granted and outstanding as of the closing date.
 
On February 22, 2017, we completed the actions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement and merged with and into BlackRidge with BlackRidge continuing as the surviving corporation ("Reorganization"). Upon completion of the Agreement, we issued 3,783,791 shares of our newly designated Series A Preferred Stock and 12,825,683 shares of Common Stock to the stockholders of BlackRidge in exchange for all the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock of BlackRidge.  Additionally, certain stockholders of the Company returned for cancellation a total of 16,284,330 shares of our Common Stock.  Upon the completion of the Reorganization, BlackRidge became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company had a total of 3,783,791 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 21,790,683 shares of Common Stock outstanding, with the former BlackRidge stockholders owning 3,783,791 shares or 100% of Series A Preferred Stock and 12,825,683 shares or approximately 58.9% of Common Stock.  Upon completion of the Reorganization, we also had outstanding warrants entitling the holders to acquire a total of 18,541,579 shares of the Company's Common Stock at an average exercise price of $0.46 per share.  The Reorganization resulted in a change of control of the Company.  For accounting purposes, BlackRidge will be treated as the acquirer and the historical financial statements of BlackRidge will become the Company's historical financial statements.  The acquisition is intended to constitute a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
At the closing of the Reorganization, Robert Graham was appointed as President, and John Bluher was appointed Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary.  In addition, Bruce Crane resigned from his position as a director and Robert Graham was appointed as a director of the Company to fill the vacancy created by such resignation.  John Hofman, our remaining director, resigned from such position effective following our compliance with rule 14f-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and John Hayes and Robert Lentz were appointed as directors of the Company effective at such time as Mr. Hofman's resignation became effective.
 
On March 31, 2017, the Company completed the sale of substantially all assets, other than cash, used in or connection with the Company's home grain mill and kitchen mixer business to John Hofman and Bruce Crane, former officers and directors of the Company, in consideration for the assumption by such persons of substantially all the liabilities incurred by the Company in connection with such business.  The assets divested consisted of the non-cybersecurity assets of the Company and included accounts receivable, inventory, deposits, property and equipment and intangible assets.  The liabilities divested included the non-cybersecurity liabilities of the Company and included accounts payable and accrued expenses and long and short-term notes payable and accrued interest thereon. 
 
On July 2, 2017, the Company filed Restated Articles with the Secretary of State of Nevada to, among other things, change the Company's name to BlackRidge Technology International, Inc.

Business
 
The Company develops, markets and supports a family of products that provide a next generation cyber security solution for protecting enterprise networks and cloud services. With our patented technology, network and server resources located in the enterprise, datacenters and cloud systems, are better protected, less expensive to protect, and less vulnerable to compromise from cyber-attacks and insider threats. We believe that our identity-based approach to network and cloud security offers superior performance compared to legacy network security approaches, and reduces the total cost of ownership for organizations by eliminating malicious and unwanted traffic from their networks and systems.
 
BlackRidge products provide advanced capabilities compared to advanced firewalls in applications such as network segmentation and isolating cloud services.  BlackRidge also cloaks protected network resources from network mapping, reconnaissance and other forms of unauthorized access and attacks which cannot be blocked by advanced firewalls or malware detection systems.
 
Our proprietary technology, BlackRidge Transport Access Control ("TAC"), authenticates user or device identity and applies security policies across networks and cloud services before application sessions are established. Underlying BlackRidge TAC is our patented First Packet Authentication™ which conveys and authenticates identity in the "first packet" of a TCP network session request. This fundamental invention addresses a security gap in how the Internet operates: the inability to authenticate network traffic sources. Without authentication, unidentified and unauthorized users and devices can scan, probe and access networks and cloud services. This security gap is exploited in all cyber-attacks through the process of network scanning and reconnaissance, and it has been further exposed and magnified by cloud services, mobile connectivity, and the Internet of Things.
 
The Company's technology is first to market with this approach of enforcing security policy based on cryptographically secured identity on every TCP/IP session.
 
Our products are protected by multiple U.S. Patents including "First Packet Authentication," "Concealing a Network Connected Device," "Digital Identity Authentication," and "Statistical Object Identification."

BlackRidge markets and sells its products through multiple channels, including direct sales, integrator and reseller channel partners, cloud and managed service providers, and through strategic Original Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM") partners to both government and commercial users. The initial sales focus and market entry strategy for BlackRidge was the US Department of Defense, which is a key leverage point for the company's current commercial, government, and international sales efforts. Our customers and partners include IBM, Ciena, Crimson Logic, the US Department of Defense, the US Department of Energy, Marist College, Nihon Cornet Technology, Splunk and healthcare providers.
 
Within the commercial markets, BlackRidge sells both direct and through our strategic partners to large enterprise accounts, and indirectly through certain channel partners to specific verticals and international market segments. Our initial market entry strategy for the commercial market is to sell directly in order to establish customer references with large enterprises in North America that have high security and compliance requirements.  These include more complex regulated enterprises such as Financial Services, Healthcare, Insurance and Utility companies. Our channel partners are recruited to assist with expanding enterprise sales, commercializing specific vertical markets, and penetrating the international markets. Revenue from commercial sales includes product licensing fees, installation services, and annual support based on a standard price list.
 
In the government markets, BlackRidge sells its standard commercial products through a wholly owned subsidiary, BlackRidge Technology Government, to government resellers, integrators and contractors who resell to the Department of Defense (DOD) and civilian agencies. BlackRidge has been involved with the DOD for over six years, including our initial product development funding which was provided by the U.S. DOD. The BlackRidge products have been designed for several large DOD programs and they have been extensively tested and validated for use by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) labs. The timing of the DOD adoption of BlackRidge products depends on approval of budgets and final product testing approvals from DISA. BlackRidge Government revenue is net of government discounts, contracting fees, and channel and service partner discounts.
 
The BlackRidge OEM and service provider partnership strategy is to make targeted investments to capitalize on opportunities in specific market segments such as the industrial Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain networks, and cloud solution providers. For these markets and our partners, BlackRidge TAC can be deployed as an integrated or embedded capability in the partners' equipment and vertical market solutions, and sold and supported by our partner. BlackRidge provides unique, integrated identity-based cyber defense for these OEM products or service offerings that provides their end user customer with a competitive market advantage in the face of today's advanced cyber threats. Revenue from OEM offerings flows from embedded product licensing fees and support fees that are somewhat unique to each OEM offering.

Competition
 
BlackRidge TAC operates at the Transport Layer to provide a highly scalable, non-interactive authentication protocol that does not rely on signatures, sandboxing, or deep packet inspection. This provides key competitive differentiators including high through-put with very low latency, compatibility with existing network and security technologies and middle boxes, address and topology independent, and supports it network address translation (NAT).
 
We compete with other technology research and development, and sales companies for enterprise security spending and for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to invest in such companies. The presence of competing companies in our field of endeavor may impact our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or further acquisitions, if investors perceive that investments in our competitors are more attractive based on the merit of their technologies, or the advanced stage of marketing or development or the price of the investment opportunity. We face competition from many companies, major universities and research institutions in the United States and abroad. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources, experience in conducting research, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for their products, operating experience, research and development and marketing capabilities, name recognition and production capabilities. We will face competition from companies marketing existing products or developing new products which may render our technologies (and products) obsolete.
 These companies may have numerous competitive advantages, including:
 

· | significantly greater name recognition; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | established distribution networks; 
· | more advanced technologies and product development; 
· | additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates, higher discounts or incentives; and 
· | greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, obtaining regulatory approval for products

 
Our commercial success depends on our ability to compete effectively in product development areas such as, but not limited to, safety, price, marketing and distribution. There can be no assurance that competitors will not succeed in developing products that are more effective than our cyber security technology, therefore rendering our products obsolete and noncompetitive.  Accordingly, in addition to our research and development efforts, we believe we need to create a public relations/advertising program designed to establish our "brand" name recognition; we intend to continue to develop and market our brand name pending commercialization of products, if any, we may derive from our research and development efforts.
 
Our strategy drives the marketing, distribution and public acceptance of any products we may derive from our research and development.  Competition with respect to our technologies is and will be based, among other things, on effectiveness, latency, reliability, availability, price, marketing, distribution and patent position. Another important factor will be the timing of market introduction of any new versions of the software or development of new products and cyber security solutions new markets such industrial control systems (ICS) and the Industrial Internet of Things ("IIoT").
  9
 
Accordingly, the speed with which we can distribute and sell products and the speed to market with new or updated versions of the existing software, complete testing and proof of concept processes and ultimately supply commercial quantities of our products to the market and channels is expected to be an important competitive factor.
 
Our competitive position will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes, and to secure sufficient capital resources for the often-substantial period between technological conception and commercial sales.
