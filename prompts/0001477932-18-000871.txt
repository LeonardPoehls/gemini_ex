Plan of Operations
 
Sector 5 sells branded electronic products targeting the educational and consumer electronics markets. 
 
Sector 5 intends to take advantage of the educational market to initiate targeting the retail consumer electronics market using a supply-chain methodology involving Open Innovation. Sector 5 has relationships with Chinese suppliers employing American ingenuity that allows us to create products with latest technology, matching market expectations at the best pricing. We plan to accomplish this through the involvement of a talented staff, including designers and innovators, coupled with strong relationships with “best in class” suppliers.
 
Sector 5's distribution channel strategy includes both B2B (especially schools) as well as utilization of existing relationships with distributors that have retail channels looking for new innovative products. Furthermore, we intend to use mobile carriers as sales channels on some unique new 4G LTE products which employ mobile data networks. Building and maintaining good distribution relationships will be an essential element of our business. In our product planning efforts, we expect to both listen to these sales channels for what opportunity they have as well as provide them new product opportunities we are planning. The latter will become increasingly important as we intend to grow a portfolio of products uniquely ours.
 
Sector 5's foundation for success and promise to the world is defined by a pursuit of simplicity and a commitment to innovation. Quality, reliability and excellent customer support is an integral component of that commitment.
 
Products
 
Our initial phase will focus on the education markets utilizing Chrome and Android Operating Systems. As we ramp up a sales staff, we intend to broadly target general consumer retail channels and possibly other B2B opportunities (e.g. hospitals). In this phase we will need to carefully and continuously balance growth in width (number of sales channels and product sku’s) versus depth (quality of service and support). 
 
We are currently negotiating contracts with established sales and marketing individuals and companies who can get Sector 5 branded products placed in the major retail channels. Google is assisting in opening up relationships with major distributors for the US markets.
 
During the second phase, we plan to launch a number of products aimed at the educational market:
 


· | Chromebooks optimized for education 11.6” and 13” 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Charging carts for bulk charging and storage of Chromebooks (various models)
· | Electronic whiteboard (1 model) 
· | Large touch screen (2 models) 
· | Classroom speakers (2 models) 
· | Classroom microphone (1 model) 
· | Chromebook HDMI connected monitor 24”

Our third phase includes plans to launch the following products, integrating our intellectual property:
 


· | Chromebox with camera (our own patented design) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Possibly Chromebooks with 4G LTE, to be distributed B2B and through wireless carriers
· | Smart Pico Projector with 4G LTE 
· | Bedroom Smart Pico Projector/speaker/wall mount kit bundle 
· | Action camera with 4K resolution utilizing 4G LTE for connectivity 

 
We plan to continuously explore business opportunities, possibly expanding these product categories. Using the strength of our current partners manufacturing capabilities, Sector 5 has identified new product categories in which our key suppliers will assist in the development of new products accommodating our ideas and requirements. Our unique relationships with the leading electronics suppliers in Shenzhen, China will enable us to gain advantages of not only low cost manufacturing but also achieving the best of the Open Innovation partnership making it possible for us to realize first-in-market, unique and affordable products. Shenzhen (called High Tech Zone) is a hub of Chinese innovation where many of the major Chinese electronics firms are located. Shenzhen is rapidly becoming the Chinese version of Silicon Valley. Late in our third phase we plan to create our first Android 5 portfolio of Smart TV solutions:
 


· | Smart TV box (possibly similar hardware as Chromebox).
--+-------------------------------------------------------
· | Smart TVs (larger sizes) 
· | Android tablets for education 
· | Premium speakers (Bluetooth, WiFi, Surround) 
· | Headsets & headphones 

Who We Sell To
 
Sector 5 plans to hire a sales staff with long standing relationships with the buyers of “Big Box” retailers. Sector 5 also plans on hiring staff that have relationship with reps in the educational market. Sector 5 has relationships with large companies who are currently dominating the online sales channels. Our target customers are anyone in need of consumer, education or business electronics seeking the best combination of value, simplicity, usability and reliability. Our customers are intelligent and informed decision makers who will not only judge us from our marketing messages but also seek objective input from independent reviews e.g. CNET, Engadget and others. For this reason we plan a budget that covers the traditional marketing efforts as well as efforts on performing critical product Quality Assurance and engagement with reviewers in enabling the best reviews. Getting good reviews is important for our brand reputation to get the best start.
 
Our planned marketing staffs will include members solely focused on the educational computing market and members solely focused on the consumer retail market. However, we plan to have a unified R&D effort that will aim at maximizing synergies in an effort to reduce R&D costs. On the education side, we plan to send out samples to the school with RFP’s that we have identified that currently have the resources to start buying our products now. Geographically we plan to target both the USA and Canada. Most of the business with the schools involves a bidding process and we plan on being the best priced on the market, coupled with superior features/performance. Features we plan to emphasize include better graphical processing and more school optimized enclosure with easy carry handles. We believe that we can be highly successful in the educational bidding process. Our supply chain allows nearly unlimited growth potential as it includes a very extensive list of product categories covering involving excellent engineering teams. We will continuously aim at enabling growth through presenting new business opportunities to buyers from within our vendor partner capabilities.
 
Our goal is Educating America’s Children utilizing the power of Google and the Chromebook proven technology. We plan to achieve our goal by delivering the latest generation of technology, creating a new market expectation together with unique value added differentiation and introducing the latest Chromebook defined by Speed, Security and Simplicity at the best possible price.
