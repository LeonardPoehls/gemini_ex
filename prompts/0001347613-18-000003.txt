ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Unless the context requires otherwise, the words “Synergy,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” refer to Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. and, where appropriate, our subsidiaries. TRULANCE® is a trademark of Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. Any other trademarks reference in this Form 10-K are the property of their respective owners. All rights reserved.
Business Overview
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel gastrointestinal (GI) therapies. We have pioneered discovery, research and development efforts around analogs of uroguanylin, a naturally occurring and endogenous human GI peptide, for the treatment of GI diseases and disorders. We discovered and own 100% worldwide rights to our proprietary uroguanylin based GI platform which includes one commercial product and one development stage compound. 
Our first and only commercial product, plecanatide, is available and being marketed by us in the United States (U.S.), under the trademark name TRULANCE®, for the treatment of adults with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). On February 27, 2018 we entered into a definitive licensing agreement with Cipher Pharmaceuticals under which we granted Cipher the exclusive right to develop, market, distribute and sell TRULANCE in Canada. Under the terms of the licensing agreement, Synergy received an upfront payment of $5.0 million and is eligible for an additional milestone payment, as well as royalties from product sales in Canada. We are continuing to evaluate other potential ex-US business development opportunities for TRULANCE.
Dolcanatide is our development stage compound that has demonstrated proof-of-concept in treating patients with ulcerative colitis. We are currently exploring potential business development opportunities to further advance dolcanatide

development in ulcerative colitis. In addition, we have shown proof-of-concept with dolcanatide in treating patients with opioid-induced constipation (OIC), demonstrating the utility of our uroguanylin based platform in OIC. We are considering OIC as a potential lifecycle growth opportunity for TRULANCE.
TRULANCE (plecanatide)
With the exception of a single amino acid substitution for greater binding affinity, TRULANCE is structurally identical to human uroguanylin and is the only treatment thought to replicate the pH-sensitive activity of uroguanylin. Uroguanylin activates GC-C receptors in a pH-sensitive manner primarily in the small intestine, stimulating fluid secretion and maintaining stool consistency necessary for regular bowel function.
In January 2017, the FDA approved TRULANCE 3 mg tablets for the once-daily treatment of adults with CIC. We began commercializing TRULANCE in the U.S. in March 2017. In January 2018, the FDA approved TRULANCE for the treatment of adults with IBS-C. The efficacy and safety of TRULANCE for the treatment of CIC and IBS-C was established in four 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical studies involving over 3,100 patients. TRULANCE demonstrated improvement in the abdominal pain, constipation, stool consistency and straining with bowel movements associated with IBS-C, as well as in the constipation, stool consistency and straining with bowel movements associated with CIC. These patient-reported symptoms returned within one week following discontinuation of TRULANCE. The most common adverse event in both CIC and IBS-C studies was diarrhea (≤5.0% vs. 1.0% placebo). TRULANCE is the only prescription medication for adults with CIC and IBS-C that can be taken once-daily, with or without food, at any time of the day. TRULANCE is packaged in a unique, 30-day calendar blister pack. 
Ongoing Post Marketing Commitments
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) (21 U.S.C. 355c), clinical studies are underway assessing the efficacy and safety of TRULANCE in pediatric patients with CIC and in late planning stages for assessment of the efficacy and safety of TRULANCE in pediatric patients with IBS-C. In addition, development and validation of an anti-drug antibody assay is underway to assess patient clinical trial samples for the potential presence of anti-plecanatide antibodies. As agreed with the FDA following Trulance approval in the CIC indication, we continue with the execution of a milk-only lactation study and the assessment of GC-C receptor density in infants and children (age 0-6 years).
CIC / IBS-C 
CIC and IBS-C are chronic, functional GI disorders that afflict millions of people worldwide. An estimated 33 million adults suffer from CIC and 12 million adults suffer from IBS-C in the U.S. alone. 
People with CIC have persistent symptoms of difficult-to-pass and infrequent bowel movements. In addition to physical symptoms including abdominal bloating and discomfort, CIC can adversely affect an individual’s quality of life, including increasing stress levels and anxiety. Many patients attempt to manage CIC symptoms with improved diet, fiber, and over-the-counter laxatives; however, these options can be ineffective or may not provide long-term relief. For those patients with persistent symptoms, prescription therapy is recommended. Many patients taking prescription medications fail to respond to therapy, or suffer from treatment-related adverse events, such as nausea and diarrhea.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with 2 or more of the following criteria: related to defecation, associated with a change in the frequency of stool, or associated with a change in the form (appearance) of the stool. IBS can be subtyped by the predominant stool form as measured by the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS): constipation (IBS-C), diarrhea (IBS-D), or mixed (IBS-M). Those within the IBS-C subtype experience Bristol types 1 or 2 (hard or lumpy) stools more than 25 percent of the time they have an abnormal bowel movement, and Bristol types 6 or 7 (loose or watery) stools less than 25 percent of the time they have an abnormal bowel movement. Some of the IBS treatment approaches recognized by the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), including specialized diets, fiber, and psychological interventions, may not always effectively address abdominal pain and discomfort experienced by these patients. While there are prescription drug options, not all patients find complete relief, and many struggle with adverse events. 
Dolcanatide (SP-333)
Dolcanatide is designed to be an analog of uroguanylin with enhanced resistance to standard digestive breakdown by proteases in the intestine. We have demonstrated the potential anti-inflammatory role of uroguanylin and uroguanylin analogs in a number of preclinical colitis models. In these earlier animal studies, oral treatment with dolcanatide was shown to ameliorate DSS- and TNBS-induced acute colitis in murine models and ameliorate spontaneous colitis in T-cell receptor alpha knockout mice.
4

In January 2016, we announced positive proof-of-concept with dolcanatide in a phase 1b trial evaluating 28 patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. We are exploring business development opportunities to further advance dolcanatide development in ulcerative colitis. 
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies focusing on GI such as Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Allergan plc, Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (acquired by Mallinckrodt plc), AstraZeneca, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. and Shire, Plc. Most of our competitors have financial, technical and marketing resources significantly greater than our resources. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or through joint ventures. We are aware of certain development projects for products to prevent or treat certain diseases targeted by us. The existence of these potential products or other products or treatments of which we are not aware, or products or treatments that may be developed in the future, may adversely affect our ability to market the products we develop.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development costs include expenditures in connection with operating an in-house research and development laboratory, salaries and staff costs, application and filing for regulatory approval of proposed products, purchased in-process research and development, regulatory and scientific consulting fees, as well as contract research, patient costs, drug formulation and tableting, data collection, monitoring, clinical trial insurance. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $48.3 million, as compared to approximately $87.1 million and $78.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 730-10-55, Research and Development, we recorded prepaid research and development costs of approximately $0.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and $0.5 million as of December 31, 2016, for nonrefundable pre-payments for production of drug substance, analytical testing services and clinical trial costs for our drug candidates. In accordance with this guidance, we expense deferred research and development costs when drug compound is delivered or services are performed.
Manufacturing and Supply
We currently manage our global supply and distribution of TRULANCE through third party contract manufacturers. It is our objective to produce safe, pure and effective medicine. TRULANCE production consists of three phases-manufacture of (i) the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API (sometimes referred to as drug substance), (ii) manufacture of drug product and (iii) manufacture of packaged finished goods, as well as distribution agreements. We have entered into arrangements with third party manufacturers for the production of TRULANCE. We continue to pursue additional commercial supply agreements with additional manufacturers for TRULANCE for U.S. and worldwide use. We believe our commercial suppliers will have the capabilities to produce TRULANCE in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, or GMP, on a sufficient scale to meet our commercial needs.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We are able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as a trade secret or is protected by confidentiality agreements. Accordingly, patents or other proprietary rights are an essential element of our business.
As of December 31, 2017 we have 24 issued United States patents related to guanylate cyclase agonists. Two of these patents cover the composition-of-matter of TRULANCE and were issued on May 9, 2006 and September 21, 2010; they will expire in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The patent that issued on May 9, 2006 has claims directed to the species of TRULANCE, whereas the patent that issued on September 21, 2010 has claims directed to a genus of peptides that are identical in length to TRULANCE and is inclusive of TRULANCE.

On September 14, 2012 we entered into a binding letter of intent with Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Ironwood”), pursuant to which we and Ironwood agreed to enter into a definitive license agreement giving us an exclusive worldwide license to Ironwood’s method of use patents on TRULANCE. The letter of intent contemplates a low single digit royalty on net sales of TRULANCE and both parties agreed not to challenge each other’s patents covering certain GC-C agonists, except that we retain the right to challenge Ironwood’s method of use patents on TRULANCE.
Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
While trade secret protection is an essential element of our business and we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, we cannot give assurance that our unpatented proprietary technology will afford us significant commercial protection. We seek to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees and consultants. Our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their 
6

interests in intellectual property arising from their work for us. All employees sign an agreement not to engage in any conflicting employment or activity during their employment with us and not to disclose or misuse our confidential information. However, it is possible that these agreements may be breached or invalidated, and if so, there may not be an adequate corrective remedy available. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that employees, consultants or third parties will not breach the confidentiality provisions in our contracts, infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets and other proprietary rights or that measures we are taking to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate.
In the future, third parties may file claims asserting that our technologies or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert such claims against us or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. If we are forced to defend ourselves against such claims, whether they are with or without merit and whether they are resolved in favor of, or against, our licensors or us, we may face costly litigation and the diversion of management’s attention and resources. As a result of such disputes, we may have to develop costly non-infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements, if necessary, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
Government Regulation
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food and Drug Administration, and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority and failure to abide by applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution, disgorgement of profits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approval, refusal to approve pending applications, and criminal prosecution.
FDA Approval Process
Our product candidates are regulated by the FDA as drugs. No manufacturer may market a new drug until it has submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA, and the FDA has approved it. The steps required before the FDA may approve an NDA generally include:

• | preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted in compliance with FDA’s good laboratory practice requirements;


• | development, manufacture and testing of active pharmaceutical product and dosage forms suitable for human use in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or GMP;


• | the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its specific intended use(s);


• | the submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. We must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before we may commence human clinical trials. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after its receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions before that time about the conduct of the proposed trials. In such a case, we must work with the FDA to resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board for approval. An institutional review board may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the institutional review board’s requirements or may impose other conditions.
7

Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to humans under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, though the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects, the drug is usually tested for safety (adverse effects), dosage tolerance and pharmacologic action, as well as to understand how the drug is taken up by and distributed within the body. Phase 2 usually involves studies in a limited patient population (individuals with the disease under study) to:

• | evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted conditions;


• | determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage as well as other important information about how to design larger Phase 3 trials; and


• | identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.

Phase 3 trials generally further evaluate clinical efficacy and test for safety within an expanded patient population. The conduct of the clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with good clinical practice regulations and guidance.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. We may also suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds.
The results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including the manufacture and composition of the product candidate, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. If the NDA contains all pertinent information and data, the FDA will “file” the application and begin review. The FDA may “refuse to file” the NDA if it does not contain all pertinent information and data. In that case, the applicant may resubmit the NDA when it contains the missing information and data.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of new drug applications. Most such applications for non-priority drug products are reviewed within 10 months. The review process, however, may be extended by FDA requests for additional information, preclinical or clinical studies, clarification regarding information already provided in the submission, or submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. The FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured and will not approve the product candidate unless GMP compliance is satisfactory. FDA also typically inspects facilities responsible for performing animal testing, as well as clinical investigators who participate in clinical trials. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing or information. The FDA may also limit the indications for use and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and our product candidates may not be approved on a timely basis, if at all. The time and expense required to perform the clinical testing necessary to obtain FDA approval for regulated products can frequently exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create the product. The results of preclinical studies and initial clinical trials of our product candidates are not necessarily predictive of the results from large-scale clinical trials, and clinical trials may be subject to additional costs, delays or modifications due to a number of factors, including difficulty in obtaining enough patients, investigators or product candidate supply. Failure by us to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals or in complying with requirements could adversely affect the commercialization of product candidates and our ability to receive product or royalty revenues.

Other Regulatory Requirements
After approval, drug products are subject to extensive continuing regulation by the FDA, which include company obligations to manufacture products in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, maintain and provide to the FDA updated safety and efficacy information, report adverse experiences with the product, keep certain records and submit periodic reports, obtain FDA approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes, and comply with FDA promotion and advertising requirements and restrictions. Failure to meet these obligations can result in various adverse consequences, both voluntary and FDA-imposed, including product recalls, withdrawal of approval, restrictions on marketing, and the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties against the NDA holder. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown safety or efficacy issues may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or NDA holder.
We and any manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s GMP regulations. GMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation.  The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet GMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and any third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations.
With respect to post-market product advertising and promotion, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry- sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
Outside the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the European Union registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one European Union member state.
We are also subject to various environmental, health and safety regulations including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous materials. From time to time, and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous materials.
Employees
As of March 1, 2018, we had 313 employees. Approximately 16 were in our scientific and drug development organization, 15 were in technical operations and quality assurance, 254 were in our sales and commercial team, and 26 were in general and administrative functions. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
