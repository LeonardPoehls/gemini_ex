ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
Citrix is a Delaware corporation founded on April 17, 1989. We deliver solutions to make applications and data secure and easy to access, anywhere, anytime and on any device or network. 
The world is in a new era where physical and digital worlds are converging, and where everything is connected. The pace of change is exponential and the possibilities for improving how we work and live are limitless. 
Digital transformation is occurring in every industry and is being fueled by unprecedented adoption and convergence of mobile, cloud, big data analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT). At the same time, organizations are struggling with technological complexity, heterogeneity and information overload.
 Businesses have spent years building unique operating models, investing in countless systems, platforms, and devices and then deeply customizing it all. Yet these legacy systems are making it difficult to adopt new innovations, devices and platforms needed to move forward. It is also creating new challenges for IT departments that must manage and secure it all. Further, an increasing number of workloads are becoming mobile. 
Finally, concerns about security are top of mind for every organization today. And the pressures of the multitude of devices, endpoints and networks are straining the limits of existing infrastructures and calling into question traditional device- or network-centric security approaches, which cannot keep pace with the new devices, application platforms and networks being introduced.
Our mission is to power a world where people, organizations and things are securely connected and accessible. We aim to accomplish this by building the world’s best integrated technology services for secure delivery of apps and data anytime, anywhere. 
We market and license our products directly to customers, over the Web, and through independent software vendors, or ISVs, in addition to indirectly through systems integrators, or SIs, value-added resellers, or VARs, value-added distributors, or VADs, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs and service providers.
Separation of GoTo Business
On January 31, 2017, we completed the separation and subsequent merger of the GoTo family of service offerings of our wholly-owned subsidiary, GetGo, to LogMeIn pursuant to a pro rata distribution to our stockholders of 100% of the shares of common stock of GetGo, pursuant to a Reverse Morris Trust (RMT) transaction. The GoTo family of service offerings consists of GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, GoToTraining, GoToMyPC, GoToAssist, Grasshopper and OpenVoice, or the GoTo Business, and had historically been part of our GoTo Business segment (formerly the Mobility Apps segment). As a result, in 2017, we will report the GoTo Business as discontinued operations.

Additional sales personnel, working in central locations and in the field, provide support including recruitment of prospective partners and technical training with respect to our products. 
In fiscal years 2016 and 2015, there were no individual customers that accounted for over 10% of our total net revenues. In fiscal year 2014, one distributor, Ingram Micro, accounted for 13% of our total net revenues. Our distributor arrangements with Ingram Micro consist of several non-exclusive, independently negotiated agreements with its subsidiaries, each of which covers different countries or regions. Each agreement is negotiated separately and is independent of any other contract (such as 
 9

a master distribution agreement), one of which was individually responsible for over 10% of our total net revenues in fiscal year 2014. 
We are not obligated to accept product returns from our distributors under any conditions, unless the product item is defective in manufacture. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for information regarding our revenue recognition policy.
International revenues (sales outside the United States) accounted for approximately 40.7% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, 43.1% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 45.2% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. For detailed information on our international revenues, please refer to Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Segment Revenue
Our revenues are derived from our Enterprise and Service Provider products, which primarily include Workspace Services solutions, Delivery Networking products, Cloud Services solutions, and related license updates and maintenance, support and professional services and from the GoTo Business segment's Communications Cloud and Workflow Cloud products. The Enterprise and Service Provider and the GoTo Business segment constitute our two reportable segments. On January 31, 2017, we completed the divestiture of the GoTo Business of our wholly-owned subsidiary, GetGo. As such, we are currently evaluating our segment reporting for 2017 as a result of these changes. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Operations
For our Delivery Networking products, which include NetScaler ADC, we use independent contractors to provide a redundant source of manufacture and assembly capabilities. Independent contractors provide us with the flexibility needed to meet our product quality and delivery requirements. We have manufacturing relationships that we enter into in the ordinary course of business, primarily with Flextronics under which we have subcontracted the majority of our hardware manufacturing activity, generally on a purchase order basis. These third-party contract manufacturers also provide final test, warehousing and shipping services. This subcontracting activity extends from prototypes to full production and includes activities such as material procurement, final assembly, test, control, shipment to our customers and repairs. Together with our contract manufacturers, we design, specify and monitor the tests that are required to meet internal and external quality standards. Our contract manufacturers manufacture our products based on forecasted demand for our products. Each of the contract manufacturers procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and test the products according to our specifications. We are dual-sourced on our components, however, in some instances, those sources may be located in the same geographic area. Accordingly, if a natural disaster occurred in one of those areas, we may need to seek additional sources. Products are then shipped to our distributors, VARs or end-users. If the products go unsold for specified periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for products ordered to meet our forecast or customer orders. In 2016, we did not experience any material difficulties or significant delays in the manufacture and assembly of our products.
We control all purchasing, inventory, scheduling, order processing and accounting functions related to our operations. For our software products, production, warehousing and shipping are performed by our independent contractors HPE, Ireland and Digital River. Master software, development of user manuals, packaging designs, initial product quality control and testing are primarily performed at our facilities. In some cases, independent contractors also duplicate master software, print documentation and package and assemble products to our specifications. 
While it is generally our practice to promptly ship product upon receipt of properly finalized purchase orders, we sometimes have orders that have not shipped upon receipt of a purchase order. Although the amount of such product license orders may vary, the amount, if any, of such orders at the end of a fiscal year is not material to our business. We do not believe that backlog, as of any particular date, is a reliable indicator of future performance.
We believe that our fourth quarter revenues and expenses are affected by a number of seasonal factors, including the lapse of many corporations' fiscal year budgets and an increase in amounts paid pursuant to our sales compensation plans due to compensation plan accelerators that are often triggered in the fourth quarter. We believe that these seasonal factors are common within our industry. Such factors historically have resulted in first quarter revenues in any year being lower than the immediately preceding fourth quarter. We expect this trend to continue through the first quarter of 2017. In addition, our European operations generally generate lower revenues in the summer months because of the generally reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. This seasonal factor also typically results in higher fourth quarter revenues.

Competition 
We sell our products in intensely competitive markets. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing and other resources than we do. As the markets for our products and services continue to develop, additional companies, including those with significant market presence in the computer appliances, software, cloud services and networking industries, could enter the markets in which we compete and further intensify competition. In addition, we believe price competition could become a more significant competitive factor in the future. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our historic prices and margins, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Technology Relationships” and Part I-Item 1A entitled “Risk Factors” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Workspace Services 
Our Application Virtualization and VDI solutions are based on an alternative technology platform the success of which will depend on organizations and customers perceiving technological, operational and security benefits and cost savings associated with adopting desktop and application virtualization solutions. We differentiate from basic virtualization solutions with robust security, flexibility and end user experience to enable IT to deliver Windows apps and desktops for better business outcomes. Our primary competition in this market is the existing IT desktop management practice of manually configuring physical desktops, which is time-consuming, expensive and subject to inconsistency. We also face numerous competitors that provide automation of these processes and alternative approaches, including VMware's Horizon product and the emergence of virtual applications and desktop delivery from public and private cloud services, including Amazon Web Service’s product Amazon WorkSpaces. Also, there continues to be an increase in the number of alternatives to Windows-based applications and Windows operating system powered desktops, in particular SaaS-delivered applications and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. We believe XenApp and XenDesktop give us a competitive advantage by providing customers multiple ways to virtualize and deliver desktops and/or apps with one, integrated virtualization system and delivering a higher performance user experience, more robust security and the flexibility for people to use any device and IT to use any infrastructure - public or private clouds, hyper-converged, traditional servers and storage, or combinations of each. No other competitor can currently match this level of flexibility and choice in VDI and app virtualization solutions.
Our Enterprise Mobility Management product line, XenMobile, competes with AirWatch by VMware, MobileIron, Good Technology by BlackBerry and many other smaller competitors. We believe we differentiate ourselves from these competitors by providing the most complete solution on the market, with MDM, MAM and superior core mobile productivity applications, including secure mobile email, calendar, browser, notes and more along with integration with Microsoft's mobility management platform, EMS. Our apps feature unique workflow integrations designed to make people work better, a significant advantage over competitors that do not focus on the end user experience and either have basic applications or rely on third parties for their mobile apps and can drive similar integrations.
We also see competition from competitors that are combining mobile and desktop technologies. We believe our solution, Citrix Workspace Suite, is the best solution available today that can securely deliver a secure digital workspace - with any Windows, Web, SaaS and native mobile applications, data and virtual desktops - to any device, anywhere. For example, VMware offers the VMware Workspace Suite and more recently introduced VMware Workspace ONE. We expect other vendors to follow suit. We offer market-leading technologies for every component of the Citrix Workspace Suite. Further, we believe that our end-user experience is a competitive edge when compared to the alternative solutions due to the integration, intuitiveness and self-service features of our offerings. 
Delivery Networking
Our NetScaler ADC products compete against other established competitors, including, F5 Networks, Inc., or F5, and to a lesser extent, Radware, A10 Networks and Amazon Web Services. The ADC segment also includes a number of emerging start-up and open source-based competitors. The companies compete with us for traditional enterprise sales opportunities, while F5 is our principal competitor in the Internet-centric market segment. We continue to enhance NetScaler ADC's feature capability and invest in go-to-market resources to market NetScaler ADC to our existing customer base and new potential customers as well as expanding into telco and cloud provider markets. NetScaler ADC’s integration with XenApp and XenDesktop provides a major competitive advantage with customers who are already using these products.
Our NetScaler SD-WAN product competes against both traditional WAN optimization and infrastructure vendors, such as Riverbed, Cisco, Silver Peak and Blue Coat, and managed service providers.

Cloud Services
In the data sharing segment, our ShareFile product's direct competition includes Dropbox, Box, Syncplicity, BlackBerry's Watchdox, Accellion, Microsoft and Google, as well as legacy solutions such as traditional file transfer protocol, or FTP. Many of these competitors have strong brand recognition through consumer and free versions of their products. However, we believe our ShareFile product offers a superior solution for businesses as it is built specifically for the needs of business. Further, we believe that our strong reputation in certain vertical segments, along with ShareFile's integration with other Citrix products, such as Receiver and XenMobile, and our unique ability to store data on-premise or in the Cloud, are key differentiators.
GoTo Business
The GoTo Business segment competed against a host of products offered by a number of established technology players including Adobe, Google, Apple, Cisco, LMI and Microsoft, and its voice service offerings compete against services provided by telecom service providers such as Verizon, AT&T, Intercall, PGi, RingCentral, Vonage and BT. Additionally, the GoTo Business competed against a number of emerging players such as Zoom, HighFive, TeamViewer, Blue Jeans, Intercall, PGi, Ring Central, Vonage and Splashtop. The GoTo Business also competed against a host of alternative technologies, such as VPN or cloud-based platforms, and on-premise support options. 
Proprietary Technology 
Our success is dependent upon certain proprietary technologies and core intellectual property. We have been awarded numerous domestic and foreign patents and have numerous pending patent applications in the United States and foreign countries. Our technology is also protected under copyright laws. Additionally, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality and proprietary information agreements to protect our proprietary technology. We have established proprietary trademark rights in markets across the globe, and own hundreds of U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and pending registration applications for marks such as Citrix, NetScaler ADC, NetScaler SD-WAN, ShareFile, Xen, XenApp, XenDesktop, XenServer, XenMobile and many others (including the widely known “GoTo” marks, which were transferred to LogMeIn in connection with the spin-off and subsequent merger of our subsidiary GetGo with LogMeIn that was completed in January 2017). While our competitive position could be affected by our ability to protect our proprietary information, we believe that because of the rapid pace of technological change in the industry, factors such as the technical expertise, knowledge and innovative skill of our management and technical personnel, our technology relationships, name recognition, the timeliness and quality of support services provided by us and our ability to rapidly develop, enhance and market software products could be more significant in maintaining our competitive position.
