Overview 
 
RGS Energy and its subsidiaries (“RGS”, “we,” “us,” or the “Company”) provide solar energy systems to homeowners, and commercial building owners in the United States. We believe that solar energy adoption is still in the early stages and will continue to increase as utility rates rise and customers become more knowledgeable about the savings clean and sustainable solar energy can deliver. RGS and our predecessors have installed over 26,000 solar energy systems across the continental United States and Hawaii since 1978.
 
We endeavor to make the move to solar energy simple for our customers by managing and executing the process with our sales and installation teams. We design and offer a suitable solar energy solution, then procure, permit, install, and interconnect the system to the utility grid. We provide a comprehensive workmanship warranty on each fully operational system.
 
On September 29, 2017 we executed an exclusive domestic and international world-wide Technology License Agreement (the “License”) with Dow Global Technologies LLC (“Dow”) for its POWERHOUSE™ in-roof solar shingle, an innovative and aesthetically pleasing solar shingle system developed by Dow. The POWERHOUSE™ 1.0 and 2.0 versions used CIGS (copper indium gallium selenide solar cells) technology which had a high manufacturing cost, resulting in the product not being consumer price friendly. Conversely, the POWERHOUSE™ 3.0 is being developed with traditional silicon solar cells to increase solar production and to provide a competitive consumer price point. Under terms of the License, we are pursuing final stages of development of the POWERHOUSE™ 3.0 to receive UL Certification, after which we will begin to commercialize the product in North America. Upon achieving UL Certification, we will engage third-party manufacturers for production and perform distribution logistics and services to the home building and roofing industries. Further, we plan on engaging in technological advances in panel output and expansion of potential customer base from asphalt shingle roofing to alternative roofing systems. Under a Trademark License Agreement with Dow, we will market the POWERHOUSE™ 3.0 product using the Dow name.
 
We were incorporated in Colorado in 2008 as a successor to Gaiam Energy Tech, Inc. founded in 1999.
 
A description about our operating segments and the financial information about our segments may be found in Note 10. Segment Information, to our audited financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.

Business Strategy
 
Our goals are to (i) provide solar solutions that save residential and commercial customers’ money and (ii) operate our Company at a profit. Our strategies to achieve these goals are:

• | Commercialize the POWERHOUSE™ 3.0 in-roof solar shingle. We have executed an exclusive domestic and international world-wide License with Dow for its POWERHOUSE™ 3.0 in-roof solar shingle to provide customers with a more aesthetically pleasing solar shingle system. Upon receiving UL Certification, we plan to sell the product directly to homebuilders and develop a network of authorized roofers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utilize our call center. In past years we have built a call center in our headquarters in Colorado to conduct sales via the phone and internet. This provides a cost-effective mechanism to reach potential customers and readily enter new markets. Call center personnel have access to engineering, operations, customer support and other services personnel at our headquarters location allowing them to quickly address any questions that might arise during the sales process.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to drive growth through referrals networks. We pay customers for referring additional customers. We will continue to expand these programs through the call center, post-install in-home parties, user-friendly software, and digital marketing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Identify attractive financing options for customers. We refer our customers to a variety of options for financing their solar energy systems including home improvement loans, equipment leases and power purchase agreements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utilize technology to enhance and streamline our operations. We launched RGS 365™, a mobile software and online dashboard suite, creating a better and more engaging customer experience. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths 
 
We believe our customers select us because:
 

• | We have been in the solar industry for 40 years.
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Flexible menu of product offerings. Our customers can utilize cash, loan, and third-party ownership agreements such as leasing and power purchase agreements.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Location. We are located in states where utility costs are high and/or incentives for solar energy systems are available, therefore offering an attractive alternative to conventional power sources.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe being awarded the exclusive worldwide POWERHOUSE™ License will give us a competitive edge because we will become a technology company insulated by patents creating a barrier to competition, as well as a company utilizing a product with brand recognition.
 
Description of our Services 
 
We have two divisions as of the end of 2017: (i) POWERHOUSE™ and (ii) Solar Division.
 
POWERHOUSE™: Effective September 29, 2017, the Company executed the License with Dow, to commercialize POWERHOUSE™ 3.0. Under the terms of the License, the Company has exclusive world-wide rights through 2034, the expiration of Dow’s applicable patents. The License requires that we obtain UL Certification to commercialize and sell a minimum of 50 megawatts of solar within 5-years of the Effective Date to retain exclusive world-wide rights, a requirement we believe is achievable. To obtain UL Certification we have retained Dow’s former UL consultant. Additionally, we have met with various potential supply chain vendors prior to entering negotiations. Currently we are producing samples of the product that will be sent to UL for testing. We believe our future services will be POWERHOUSE™ 3.0 solar shingles. We have entered into third-party manufacture agreements with suppliers and we plan to distribute POWERHOUSE™ solar shingles to a network of new homebuilders and roofers. Additionally, we plan to offer various services, including but not limited to system design, permit application, utility application for permission to operate (“PTO”) and assistance in procurement and/or sales of adjunct installation materials.
Solar Division: The Solar Division consists of the residential and commercial solar segments of our Company. We will continue to offer our turnkey solar energy systems providing design, engineering, financing, procurement, permitting, installing, grid interconnection, monitoring, and maintenance services. We install residential systems generally between 3 kilowatts (“kW”) and 10 kW, and commercial systems up to 500 kW in size, depending on the amount of electricity used by the customer and the size of their building. The size of the average solar energy system we installed during 2017 was approximately 8 kW. We maintain a service department to manage and assist with service and repairs, and to provide operations and maintenance service contracts for larger projects. We design and build solar energy systems to meet each customer’s individual needs and circumstances. We assess a customer’s annual power requirements and average electricity rates to size the solar system and engineer its interconnection to the grid. We assess the customer’s roof size, configuration, and composition to determine the optimum location for the solar photovoltaic modules. We factor in information about the customer’s electrical service territory, rate structures, budget, preferred financing method and aesthetic preferences. We also identify the relevant federal, state and local regulations, including building codes, which are important to the cost, operation and return on investment of the customer’s solar energy system, as well as relevant tax rates, benefits of net metering, and various other factors. We assess this data using solar production tools and analytical models to size and configure a cost-effective solar system for the customer and one that offers a return on investment to the customer that meets their requirements.
 
We prepare construction plans to obtain a building permit, which is necessary for grid interconnection and state incentive rebate processing. We also provide customers with a return-on-investment analysis which reflects the rebates and performance-based incentives that are available to each customer. Once all necessary approvals from financing partners and utilities, and incentive, rebate and jurisdictional authorities have been received, our in-house construction teams or authorized integrators begin the installation of the customer’s solar energy system. Once the solar energy system has been installed, we arrange for a final inspection by the local building department or other relevant regulatory agency and complete final as-built drawings of the system to submit applicable applications for the jurisdictional rebate(s). At the same time, we apply to the local utility company to finalize interconnection of the customer’s solar energy system to the utility grid.

Solar Energy Systems 
 
The most visible component of solar energy systems are the solar shingles or photovoltaic modules with metal racking which transforms the sunlight into direct electrical current (“DC”), which then travels to the inverter. The inverter converts the DC electricity into useable alternating current (“AC”) that matches the current of the household electrical service and the utility grid. Other major components include the monitoring which tracks the solar production of the system, and balance of system which includes mechanical and electrical parts. The electricity created can go onto the grid or be used by the customer to power household items such as lights and appliances. For customers who would like to have electrical black out protection or who want to strategically manage their electrical usage, we provide battery solutions that integrate with our solar energy systems.
POWERHOUSE™: This product is a built-in photovoltaic array (“BIPV”), also known as a solar shingle. The solar shingle is a building material that once installed becomes the roof structure. The BIPV takes the place of the module and racking in a traditional solar installation. We will not be installing these systems. Instead, we will be manufacturing the solar shingle for distribution.
Solar Division: The Solar Division will install traditional modules and racking systems. We do not manufacture any of these components. We purchase all components from the manufacturer or their distributors.
Warranty Terms 
 
POWERHOUSE™: We expect to issue a manufacturer’s warranty on POWERHOUSE™ solar shingles, equal to the third-party manufacturer terms we secure. Workmanship warranty will be provided by the installer. Our new homebuilder and roofer network, when applicable, will submit to us a return merchandise authorization (“RMA”) for defective components. We will authorize the RMA and transfer substitute POWERHOUSE™ component(s) to the customer who will return a like number of defective components. We will similarly execute a RMA with the appropriate manufacturer. As the manufacturer will provide a product warranty on the POWERHOUSE™ components to us, we will not record a warranty liability.
Solar Division: We and our suppliers offer warranties of up to 10 years for parts and labor, including property damage arising from workmanship, excluding roof penetrations which are generally warrantied for a period of 5 years. All major components installed in a photovoltaic system array are covered under transferable manufacturers’ warranties, which generally range from 10 to 25 years. Customer claims are processed through our customer service department. We will provide reasonable assistance to our customers in contacting the manufacturer concerning warranty service and undertake reasonable effort to recoup our labor costs from the manufacturer.
Financing 
 
We offer our Solar Division customers a choice to finance their solar systems with their cash, third-party loans, or third-party leases or power purchase agreements. We are constantly vetting new financing products and only refer the ones that fit the customer’s needs and desires. Our menu of finance offerings allows us to provide solar energy systems to our customers with financing terms that we believe are economically attractive for their individual situation.
Sales and Marketing
 
We have trained our sales organization to effectively engage prospective customers from initial interest to customized proposals to signed contracts. We intend to continue to educate consumers about the benefits of our solar products in order to lower our customer acquisition costs and further expand the market opportunity.

• | Inside sales – Our inside sales groups initially engage with potential customers prior to our outside sales or e-sales teams’ customer engagement. Inside sales groups identify each potential customer’s initial interest in solar energy and compile data necessary to assess potential cost savings for subsequent discussion with the potential customer by the sales teams.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Direct outside sales –Throughout 2017, we employed an outside sales force in the east coast markets and Hawaii to generate new business and complete sales orders initiated by inside sales groups from their own networking, at local events and by establishing local business alliances. The outside sales team would visit potential customers in their homes or businesses, explaining the advantages of solar energy, answering customer questions and facilitating new sales orders. Effective March 1, 2018, we have completed a realignment of our sales teams resulting in the elimination of the outside residential sales force.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sales – The e-sales teams provide an online, real time, complete customer experience. We use software and satellite imagery to review the customer’s rooftop for suitability and system capacity, and based on the customer’s current utility costs, assess the project’s potential cost savings from installation of the solar energy system. We utilize electronic contracts and digital signatures.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer referrals – Our customer referral program is designed to be an effective and efficient method of reaching new customers. Our program provides cash incentives to current customers to refer friends, relatives and co-workers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Online Digital Marketing – Consumers seek online education, purchase options, and business reviews before determining the best provider to meet their needs. In an effort to align our business with marketplace, and our sales teams with the consumer, we will continue to expand our online market presence.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customers 
 
POWERHOUSE™: Our customers will include new home builders and roofers in the re-roof market, of which there is approximately 7 million re-roofs annually in the United States.
 
Solar Division: Our residential customers are homeowners interested in reducing electrical utility costs and switching to clean, renewable energy. Our residential solar energy systems are generally rooftop installations up to 24kW in size.
 
Our commercial customers come from a variety of industries including retail, manufacturing, service, not-for-profit and municipal services. Often times, our small commercial clients arise from the relationship developed when we install a residential solar system to the owner of the small business. Our commercial solar energy systems may be roof mounted or ground mounted and are generally up to 500kW in size. Occasionally, through the course of our normal operations, we are presented with opportunities for larger (greater than 500kW) commercial solar energy systems. We evaluate each of these large opportunities on a case by case basis while minimizing onerous contract terms.
 
Suppliers 
 
POWERHOUSE™: We will engage third-party manufacturers to manufacture components of the in-roof POWERHOUSE™ solar shingle. The major components of the POWERHOUSE™ solar shingle consist of the solar laminate, connectors, wire harnesses, base assembly and integrated flashing system. The solar laminate, connectors and wire harnesses will be produced by a manufacturer located in China and shipped to our U.S. based manufacturer of the base assembly and integrated flashing system to be assembled and warehoused. The product will then be kitted and shipped to our customers.
Solar Division: Our solar energy systems utilize photovoltaic modules and inverters purchased from several manufacturers and distributors. The majority of these materials are “Buy American” under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. We negotiate pricing based on quantity purchased and payment terms. Generally, we purchase major components as needed and do not have long-term or volume commitments with suppliers. However, in response to the 201 Tariff, as discussed in Item 7 of Part II, in January 2018 we entered into a purchase commitment with one of our major vendors for solar panels on a semi-annual basis to maintain a consistent price for imported solar panels.

Competition 
 
POWERHOUSE™: The Dow Chemical Company developed the POWERHOUSE™ solar shingle and has various worldwide patents. As we have obtained exclusive licenses to commercialize the product worldwide from Dow, the patents and licenses provide a barrier to entry, thereby limiting the number of competitors. Existing sources of competition include Suntegra and CertainTeed as well as a few others who are approaching the market but have not commercialized, such as Tesla.
Solar Division: We believe our primary competitors are the traditional local utilities that supply energy to our potential customers. We compete with these traditional utilities primarily based on price, predictability of price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems rather than fossil based alternatives. We believe that our pricing and focus on customer relationships allow us to compete favorably with traditional utilities in the regions we service.
 
The other source of competition comes from other solar providers such as, the SolarCity division of Tesla, Inc., Vivint Solar Inc., Sunrun Inc., Sungevity, Inc., and many others.
 
Regulations 
    POWERHOUSE™: We will have to obtain UL Certification and maintain compliance with UL standards on POWERHOUSE™ 3.0 solar shingles and on any future development.
 
Solar Division: An interconnection agreement is generally required from the applicable local electricity utility to interconnect a solar energy system with the utility grid. In almost all cases, interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over interconnection. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection agreements are signed. We prepare and submit these agreements on behalf of our customers to ensure compliance with interconnection rules.
 
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or “OSHA”, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety. We expend resources to comply with OSHA requirements and industry best practices. Federal and/or state prevailing wage requirements, which generally apply to any “public works” construction project that receives public funds, may apply to installations of our solar energy systems on government facilities. The prevailing wage is the basic hourly rate paid on public works projects to a majority of workers engaged in a particular craft, classification or type of work within a particular area. Prevailing wage requirements are established and enforced by regulatory agencies. Our in-house personnel monitor and coordinate our continuing compliance with these regulations when required.
 
Some jurisdictions place limits on the size or number of solar energy systems that can be interconnected to the utility grid. This can limit our ability to sell and install solar energy systems in some markets. The regulatory environment is constantly changing.
 
Government Incentives and Policies
 
U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, production-based incentives, tax abatements and rebates. These incentives help catalyze private sector investments in solar energy, energy efficiency and energy storage measures, including the installation and operation of residential and commercial solar energy systems.

Following the extension of the Solar Investment Tax Credit in December 2015, the Internal Revenue Code allows a United States taxpayer to claim a tax credit of 30% of qualified expenditures for a solar energy system that is placed in service on or before December 31, 2019. This credit is scheduled to decline to 26% effective January 1, 2020, 22% in 2021, and then to 10% for commercial projects and 0% for residential projects in 2022.
 
Many U.S. states and local jurisdictions have established property tax incentives for renewable energy systems, which include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits. Many state governments, investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer rebates or other cash incentives for the installation and operation of a solar energy system or energy-related products.
 
Many states have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering. Net metering typically allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility’s retail rate for energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid in excess of electric load used by customers.
 
Some states have established limits on net metering, imposed monthly or other fees on solar energy systems, or reduced the credit available for electricity generated by solar energy systems that are connected to the utility grid. For example, Hawaii, Nevada and Mississippi have announced net metering policies that establish wholesale rates, not retail rates, for crediting electricity produced by solar energy systems. This has adversely impacted the attractiveness of solar to residential customers in these markets. The California Public Utilities Commission issued a ruling that maintains the net energy metering credit at full retail value, but adds new charges and requirements for customers installing a solar energy system. On the other hand, other states continue to expand their net metering programs. New York, for example, has suspended its cap on solar photovoltaic systems covered by the state’s net metering program.
 
Some states like Massachusetts offer Solar Renewable Energy Credits (“SRECs”) that provide cash payments based on the electricity produced by solar energy systems as an incentive for customers to invest in these systems. These programs are generally capped and must be reauthorized or extended when the cap is reached in order for the incentives to be continued. The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources announced that the total capacity available under its current SREC program (SREC-II) for projects over 25 kW had been exceeded in early 2016, however it was announced on January 31, 2017 by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources that their new program, called Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (“SMART”), is targeted to start in April 2018 and that the SREC II program would be extended in order to bridge between the two programs.
 
On January 22, 2018, the Office of the President of the United States approved in substantial form, recommendations by the U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC”) to impose a tariff of 30% on imports of solar cells and modules under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, unless specifically excluded. Further, the provisions of the 201 Tariff are applicable to imported solar cells and modules from Canada, despite its being a member of the North American Free Trade Act.
 
Seasonality 
 
Our quarterly net revenue and operating results for solar energy system installations are difficult to predict and have, in the past, and may, in the future, fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in state, federal, or private utility company subsidies, as well as weather, economic trends and other factors. We have historically experienced seasonality in our solar installation business, with the first quarter representing our lowest installation quarter of the year, primarily due to adverse weather. We have historically experienced seasonality in our sales of solar systems, with the fourth and first quarters of the year seeing less sales orders than the second and third quarters.
Employees
 
As of March 30, 2018, we had approximately 140 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.

Reverse Stock Splits
 
On January 25, 2017, we consummated a reverse stock split of all outstanding shares of our Class A common stock at a ratio of one-for-30, whereby 30 shares of Class A common stock were combined into one share of Class A common stock (the “2017 Reverse Stock Split”). The 2017 Reverse Stock Split was previously authorized by a vote of our shareholders on January 23, 2017. We did not decrease our authorized shares of capital stock in connection with the reverse stock split. Share amounts and share prices set forth in this Annual Report are presented to reflect the reverse split, as applicable.
Offerings
 
On February 6, 2017, we closed a $11.5 million offering and sale of (a) units, “February 6 Primary Units,” each consisting of one share of our Class A common stock, and a Series K warrant to purchase one share of Class A common stock, and (b) units, “February 6 Alternative Units,” each consisting of a prepaid Series L warrant to purchase one share of Class A common stock, and a Series K warrant pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 1, 2017, by and among us and several institutional investors, and to public retail investors. As a result, we issued 2,096,920 February 6 Primary Units, 1,613,080 February 6 Alternative Units, 2,096,920 shares of Class A common stock as part of the February 6 Primary Units, Series K warrants to purchase 3,710,000 shares of Class A common stock, and Series L warrants to purchase 1,613,080 shares of Class A common stock. The purchase price for a February 6 Primary Unit was $3.10 and the purchase price for a February 6 Alternative Unit was $3.09. We received net proceeds of approximately $10.5 million at the closing, after deducting commissions to the placement agents and estimated offering expenses payable by us associated with the offering. As of December 31, 2017, there were 3,710,000 Series K warrants outstanding.
 
On February 9, 2017, we closed a $6 million offering and sale of (a) units, “February 9 Primary Units,” each consisting of one share of our Class A common stock, and a Series M warrant to purchase 75% of one share of Class A common stock, and (b) units, “February 9 Alternative Units,” each consisting of a prepaid Series N warrant to purchase one share of Class A common stock, and a Series M warrant, pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 7, 2017, by and among us and several institutional and accredited investors. As a result, we issued 1,650,000 February 9 Primary Units, 750,000 February 9 Alternative Units, 1,650,000 shares of Class A common stock as part of the February 9 Primary Units, Series M warrants to purchase 1,800,000 shares of Class A common stock, and Series N warrants to purchase 750,000 shares of Class A common stock. The purchase price for a February 9 Primary Unit was $2.50 and the purchase price for a February 9 Alternative Unit was $2.49. We received net proceeds of approximately $5.5 million at the closing, after deducting commissions to the placement agents and estimated offering expenses payable by us associated with the offering. As of December 31, 2017, there were 1,609,974 Series M warrants outstanding.
 
On January 4, 2018, we closed a $1.8 million offering and sale of (a) 800,000 shares of Class A common stock, (b) a prepaid Series P Warrant to purchase 800,000 shares of Class A common stock, and (c) a Series O Warrant to purchase 1,600,000 shares of Class A common stock, pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of January 2, 2018, by and between us and one institutional and accredited investor. The purchase price was $1.15 per share of Class A common. We received net proceeds of approximately $1.5 million at the closing, after deducting commissions to the placement agents and estimated offering expenses payable by us associated with the offering.
 
On March 30, 2018, we entered into a Securities Purchases Agreement with two unaffiliated institutional and accredited investors for a private placement (the "2018 Offering") of up to $10.75 million in principal amount and $10 million funding amount (reflecting $750,000 of original issue discount) of Senior Convertible Notes (the "2018 Notes"), and Series Q Warrants to purchase 9,270,457 shares of Class A Common Stock. The closing of the 2018 Offering is subject to customary closing conditions. The 2018 Offering may result in gross proceeds of $10.0 million, before placement agent fees and other expenses associated with the transaction. We will receive $5 million of the proceeds from the sale of the 2018 Notes at closing. We also will receive a secured promissory note from each investor, in a combined aggregate amount of $5 million (each, an “Investor Note”), secured by cash and/or securities held in investor accounts.


We will issue Series A Notes and Series B Notes in the transaction. The aggregate principal amount of the Series A Notes will be $5,750,000 and the Series B Notes will be $5,000,000. All of the aggregate principal amount of the Series B Notes will constitute Restricted Principal (as defined in the Series B Notes). If an investor prepays any amount under such Investor’s Investor Note, an equal amount of the Restricted Principal becomes unrestricted principal under such Investor’s Series B Note. In lieu of initially receiving any original issue discount on the Series B Notes, the Series B Notes will accrue an “Additional OID Amount” (as defined in the Series B Notes) based upon the portion of the principal of the Series B Notes that becomes unrestricted from time to time, pro rata, which, in the aggregate would result in up to $750,000 of Additional OID Amount payable under the Series B Notes if all of the principal under the Series B Notes becomes unrestricted.

We will not be required to amortize the 2018 Notes. All amounts owed under the 2018 Notes will mature and come due upon maturity.
 
The 2018 Notes will not incur interest other than upon the occurrence of an event of default, in which case the 2018 Notes bear interest at 18% per year.
 
The 2018 Notes will be convertible at any time, at the option of the holder, into shares of Class A common stock at a conversion price. The initial fixed conversion price will be $1.2045 per share (which was above the closing bid price of our Class A common stock immediately before executing the Securities Purchase Agreement), subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and similar events.


A holder may not convert a 2018 Note and we may not issue shares of Class A common stock upon conversion of a 2018 Note, if, after giving effect to the conversion, a holder together with is “attribution parties,” would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% or 9.99%, as elected by each investor at closing, of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock. At each holder’s option, the cap may be increased or decrease to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99%, except that any increase will not be effective until the 61st day after notice to us.
 
The Securities Purchase Agreement requires us to hold a shareholders’ meeting before June 30, 2018 to seek approval of the issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock upon conversion of the 2018 Notes and exercise of the Series Q Warrants at conversion and exercise prices below the market price of our Class A common stock at the time of entering into the Securities Purchase Agreement, in compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. If, despite our reasonable best efforts such shareholder approval is not obtained at such shareholders’ meeting, we are obligated to hold recurring shareholders’ meeting until such shareholder approval is obtained. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such shareholder approval.


If we receive such shareholder approval, the conversion price of the 2018 Notes and exercise price of the Series Q Warrants would be subject to potential reduction and resets in the future, for example, upon the future issuance of securities (e.g. full-ratchet anti-dilution protection) and the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if we receive such shareholder approval, following an event of default, holders of 2018 Note holders would be permitted to convert their 2018 Notes at an “Alternate Conversion Price” and at a 125% premium in an “Alternate Conversions” (each term, as defined in the 2018 Notes). We may at any time, subject to Nasdaq’s approval and with the prior written consent of the Required Holders (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement), reduce the conversion price of the 2018 Notes and exercise price of the Series Q Warrants to any amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by our board of directors after obtaining such shareholder approval. Some of the provisions providing for reduction and reset of the conversion price of the 2018 Notes and exercise price of the Series Q Warrants are subject to a floor price, such that the adjusted conversion price or exercise price, as applicable, can never be below $0.97.


We will have the right to require mandatory conversion of the 2018 Notes if the volume-weighted average price of our Class A common stock for 10 consecutive trading days exceeds 200% of the conversion price, subject to certain “Equity Conditions” (as defined in the 2018 Notes). One of the equity conditions is that we have obtained the shareholder approval discussed above. We also have the right to redeem all, but not less than all, 2018 Notes for cash at 120% or 125% (depending on when it occurs) of the amount outstanding, subject to certain Equity Conditions. A holder of a 2018 Note may require use to redeem such note for cash at a 125% premium in connection with a transaction that results in a “Change of Control” (as defined in the 2018 Notes) and upon the occurrence of an event of default.
 
The terms of the 2018 Notes prohibit us from entering into a “fundamental transaction” (as defined in the 2018 Notes) unless the successor entity, which must be a publicly traded corporation whose common stock is quoted on or listed for trading on an Eligible Market (as defined in the 2018 Notes), assumes all of the Company’s obligations under the 2018 Notes and the other transaction documents in a written agreement approved by each 2018 Note holder. The definition of “fundamental transactions” includes, but is not limited to, mergers, a sale of all or substantially all our assets, certain tender offers and other transactions that result in a change of control.
 
The 2018 Notes will contain customary events of default, the occurrence of which triggers default interest and causes a failure of Equity Conditions, which may mean that we will be unable to force mandatory conversion of the 2018 Notes and that investors may not be required to prepay the Investor Notes under a mandatory prepayment event.
 
The 2018 Notes will contain negative and affirmative covenants, including a requirement that we on a quarterly basis have available cash of at least $750,000.

Each investor may voluntarily prepay such investor’s Investor Note, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty at any time. The Investor Notes will also be subject to mandatory prepayment, in whole or in part, upon the occurrence of (i) conversion of Restricted Principal under an investor’s Series B Note, and (ii) on the 45th day after the earlier to occur of (A) the first date on which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declares effective one or more registration statements registering the resale of the shares of Class A common stock underlying the 2018 Notes and the Series Q Warrants, and (B) the first date on which all of such shares of Class A common stock are eligible to be resold by the holders pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to (1) certain Equity Conditions, (2) a requirement that the average volume weighted average price of the Class A common stock exceed a specified amount, and (3) that no event of default is then existing and continuing.
 
At the closing of the 2018 Offering, we will enter into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with the purchaser of the 2018 Notes under which we will be required, on or before the 30th day after the closing of the 2018 Offering, to file an initial registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission covering the resale of the shares of Class A common stock issuable pursuant to the 2018 Notes and the Series Q Warrants and to use our reasonable best efforts to have that initial registration statement declared effective within specified deadlines. We will be subject to certain monetary penalties, as set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, if we fail to meet specified filing deadlines, effectiveness deadlines, maintenance requirements, and/or current public information requirements under the Registration Rights Agreement.


If the 2018 Notes have not been fully converted into shares of our Class A common stock at maturity, we would seek to refinance a remaining balance at that time from either: (i) by negotiating with the holders of the 2018 Notes, (ii) funds obtained in a public or private offering of securities, or (iii) common stock warrant exercises including our reducing the exercise price of common stock warrants to induce conversion. No assurances can be given that should a balance remain on the 2018 Notes at maturity that we will be successful in meeting the obligation under the 2018 Notes.


We believe that without determining to proceed with the commercialization of POWERHOUSE™ 3.0 we have sufficient capital resources for the ensuing 12 months. If we determine to proceed with commercialization of POWERHOUSE™ 3.0, it will require additional capital which could be met from the Investor Notes. In the event capital from the Investor Notes are not received, we would seek obtaining the capital from other transactions such as a public offering of securities, and common stock warrant exercises including reducing the exercise price of common stock warrants to induce conversion. No assurances can be given that should we determine to proceed with commercialization of POWERHOUSE™ 3.0, we will receive the additional capital necessary, either from the Investor Notes or an alternative transaction.
