ITEM 1.
 BUSINESS.

Background

United Cannabis Corporation (we our, us, UCANN, or the Company) a Colorado corporation, was originally formed as a California corporation under the name MySkin, Inc. on November 15, 2007. MySkin was engaged in the business of providing management services to a medical spa in Los Angeles, California which provided various advanced skin care services until March 31, 2014, when this business was sold to the prior President of the Company.

In early 2014 we decided to exit the medical spa management business and change our focus to providing products, services and intellectual property to the cannabis industry.

On March 26, 2014, we entered into a License Agreement with Earnest Blackmon, Tony Verzura and Chad Ruby pursuant to which Messrs. Blackmon, Verzura and Ruby licensed certain intellectual property to us in exchange for 38,690,000 shares of our common stock.

The intellectual property we licensed includes know-how relating to the design and buildout of cultivation facilities, growing/cultivation systems, seed-to-sale protocols and procedures, products, access to a genetic catalogue including over 150 different strains, an advanced (non-psychoactive) cannabinoid sequencing therapy program utilizing patent-pending Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals called the A.C.T. Now Program (ACT Now or ACT Now Program), security, regulatory compliance, and other methods and processes which relate to the cannabis industry.

In May 2014 we changed our corporate domicile from California to Colorado and changed our name to United Cannabis Corporation.

We own intellectual property relating to the legalized growth, production, manufacture, marketing, management, utilization and distribution of medical and recreational marijuana and marijuana infused products. We are focused on creating unique therapeutics for a wide range of diseases that can be utilized by patients globally. Our products are subject to all existing marijuana laws in the United States and foreign countries.

Our primary goal is to advance the use of phytocannabinoids therapeutics in medicine through research, product development and education. We are dedicated to improving the lives of patients. We provide the intellectual property, patented technology, trusted brands, clinical data, technical training, sales tools and methodologies necessary to assist our clients businesses for success. Our ACT Now Program utilizes our patented Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals with a HIPPAA compliant electronic health record (EHR) software that enables physicians to create comprehensive sequencing charts specific to their patients medical aliments. The ACT Now EHR software allows for global monitoring, patient management, and effective cannabinoid therapy protocols.

Our Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinal products are designed to help supplement deficiencies related to the endocannabinoid system including pain, neuropathy, arthritis, MS, IBS, autism, seizures, eczema, sleep, anxiety, head trauma, opioid dependency and clinical endocannabinoid deficiencies. The endocannabinoid system is a signaling system within the human body that utilizes hundreds of receptors to help maintain homeostasis between the central nervous system and the immune system. 

Our Prana Aromatherapy Transdermal Roll-on line uses a proprietary blend of essential oils infused with cannabinoids designed to provide targeted and large surface relief with combinations of aromatherapy. The transdermal is a part of the complete patented Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals line, which is offered in 5 categories (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5), with three delivery methods (sublingual, capsules, topical). Dosages range from 1mg to 50mg, are available in both raw and activated formulations, and paired with specific cannabis derived terpene profiles. 

Our short-term plan involves licensing the technology associated with our products to companies which are licensed to grow and sell medical marijuana in states where medical marijuana is legal.

Our long-term plan is to perform clinical trials on the most promising products in our product line that are currently being manufactured in California. We intend to perform our phase I clinical trials at the West Indies University in Jamaica. We will fund the initial clinical trials by licensing our Prana product line to manufacturers in all legal territories in the United States and with revenue received for providing technical, financial and licensing consulting services. After our phase 1 clinical trials are complete, we plan on partnering with companies that have expertise in global pharmaceutical distribution and research for phase II and III clinical trials in the United States.

Prana Therapeutics

In furtherance of our long-term plan, on July 14, 2017, we acquired 95% of the voting interests of Prana Therapeutics, Inc. (Prana), in consideration for the issuance of 5,730,000 shares of our shares of common stock. The acquisition of Prana broadens our foundation in plant-based drug development. Prana is a biotech company focused on developing targeted therapeutics for prevention of the negative side effects of chemotherapy, management of rheumatoid arthritis and treatment of brain cancer. 

Similar to the use of the compounds found in the cannabis plant to create our Prana Bio Medicinal products, Prana identifies novel combinations of botanical compounds to address unmet medical needs. Pranas principal drug, Epidiferphane, is a leading example of how combinatorial targeting can be used to address complex and difficult-to-treat diseases.

Prana was founded by Drs. Brent Reynolds, a professor in the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of Florida, College of Medicine and Dennis Steindler, a professor of Medical Research in the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of Florida, College of Medicine, as well as, Dr. Loic Deleyrolle, a research assistant at McKnight Brain Institute at the University Florida; and, Pranas business model is based on technology developed there. Drs. Reynolds and Steindler have filed on behalf of the University of Florida Research Foundation, Inc. (University of Florida) patents related to the composition of matter and use claims on this technology in the United States and internationally. Prana owns the exclusive, world-wide license to the technology through a licensing agreement with the University of Florida. Both Drs. Reynolds and Deleyrolle will continue as part time employees of Prana, while also serving as professors and performing research at the University of Florida. Dr. Steindler will not have any future affiliation with Prana, and Prana will be operated as a stand-alone, majority owned subsidiary of the Company.

We purchased Prana based upon our belief in the potential of Epidiferphane to help with the negative side effects of chemotherapy, inflammation and brain tumors;

The Negative Side Effects Of Chemotherapy

An estimated 650,000 patients undergo chemotherapy each year, in the US alone, at a cost of approximately $12 billion. There are several protocols to minimize the side effects associated with chemotherapy, there is currently no protocol that prevents these symptoms. Preclinical data have shown Epidiferphane to be effective in preventing Anemia (low red blood cells), Neutropenia (low white blood cells), attenuating Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy, and protecting the endogenous neural stem cell population that is associated with Chemofog (memory problems). At least one of these conditions are experienced by 90% of patients going through chemotherapy.
Inflammatory Disease

Approximately 150 million patients suffer from inflammation and pain associated with arthritis and back-centric conditions, spending in excess of $30 billion on treatments, many of which have significant side effects. Epidiferphane in combination with nutritional ketosis reduces levels of cytokines that contribute to inflammatory diseases and in a small cohort of patients has been reported to reduce pain, morning stiffness and improve sleep.
Brain Tumors

There are approximately 80,000 new brain cancer diagnoses in the US each year; Glioblastoma, the most common type, has a survival diagnosis of approximately 12 months. In pre-clinical rodent testing, Epidiferphane, in conjunction with a nutritional ketosis, has been shown to double the mean life expectancy, increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy, and sensitize chemotherapy resistant tumors to standard of care drugs.

Industrial Hemp Plant

In December 2017 we leased an industrial building in Colorado where we will construct a state-of-the-art industrial hemp processing plant where we provide contract manufacturing for farmers working under the 2014 Federal Farm Bill and Colorados Department of Agriculture's Industrial Hemp Program. The multi-function facility will include extraction, purification, testing and processing equipment, as well as packaging, fulfillment, and secure storage capabilities. 

Our manufacturing services will enable farmers to convert harvested industrial hemp plants into a range of products, including simple extracts, capsules and sublingual drops, and have them packaged for resale. The processing plant will also have the capability to process raw hemp seed through cold press extraction. Valuable fibrous bi-products generated through processing will also be collected for sale to a wide range of consumer product industries.

Colorado-grown hemp accounts for more than half of U.S. domestic hemp production, according to the Colorado Department of Agriculture. The Denver Post reported farms around in Colorado are expected to harvest up to 9,000 acres of hemp in 2017, compared with just 200 acres in 2014. 

We lease the industrial building through September 30, 2018 for $7,500 per month. The plant became fully operational on March 6, 2018.

Harborside Health Association

On January 24, 2018 we entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with
 an affiliate of Harborside Health Association LLC.

The license provided Harborside with the rights to our technology which will enable Harborside to manufacture and distribute its proprietary line of products. In consideration for the license, Harborside will pay us the greater of:

·
 5% of the gross price paid by Harborside for the manufacture of the products; or
 ·
 2.5% of the wholesale price received by Harborside from the sale of the products.

For purposes of the agreement, the “wholesale price” for any product means the gross price obtained by a distributor licensed by Harborside from the sale of any products in an arms length transaction with another distributor or retailer, excluding cannabis tax payments for remittance to taxing authorities; and, for non-arms length sales, the average price which could have been obtained in an arms length transaction.

The technology licensed to Harborside covers our patented methods of extracting, preparing and using cannabis. The agreement has a term of three years.

Cannibinoid Research & Development Company Limited (CRD)

In August 2014, we acquired 50% of the capital stock of CRD. In August 2014, we agreed to fund the operations of CRD on terms mutually agreed upon by us and CRD. As of the date of this prospectus, CRD had ten employees and had applied to the Jamaican government for a license to conduct research on the benefits of cannabis which will be grown by CRD in Jamaica.

On March 16, 2018 Jamaicas University of the West Indies Ethics Committee approved our proposal to conduct clinical trials on our Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals P1 Capsules for the treatment of chronic pain.
 The study will be conducted in conjunction with CRD at the Centre For Cannabis Research at the University of West Indies, Mona Campus, in Jamaica.

The Phase I study which will involve twelve patients, is expected to take 12 months and cost approximately $204,000.

Lasco Manufacturing Limited

On December 12, 2017 we entered into an agreement with Lasco Manufacturing Limited whereby we gave Lasco the right to manufacture and sell some of our products. The agreement is for a five year terms and covers Jamaica and most English-speaking countries in the Caribbean. The licensed products and the fees to be paid to us are:

Product | Fees 
Prana Medicinal Hemp Capsules | $550 per gallon of concentrate

Prana Bolt Balm | 15% of the gross sales price 

Advesa

We have licensed our Prana products to Advesa, Inc. (Advesa), which is wholly owned by Tony Verzura, an officer, director and principal shareholder. Advesa has an exclusive right for five years to sell our Prana products in certain cities in California. In consideration for the exclusive license, Advesa is obligated to pay us a royalty on all Prana products sold by Advesa equal to the sale price of the Prana products, minus the cost of goods sold (computed without regard to depreciation, amortization, other non-cash items or allocation of overhead, general and administrative expenses or similar items). In addition, Advesa pays us a management fee of five percent of all Advesa gross revenue, minus the Prana royalty payable to us with respect to the sales of our Prana products.

ACT Now Program

One of our primary goals is to advance the use of cannabinoids in medicine through research, product development and education. Our intellectual property includes our ACT Now Program which is a comprehensive full spectrum cannabinoid therapy guide that utilizes the entire cannabis plant by controlling specific cannabinoid ratios, accurate dosing and multiple non-invasive delivery methods. Our ACT Now Program offers a wide range of affordable patient driven programs with limitless combinations of cannabinoid-based products and nutritional recommendations to assist patients suffering from chronic pain, opiate dependency, inflammation, glaucoma, PTSD, neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, Crohns, IBS, seizures, epilepsy, paralysis, autoimmune, autism, tumors, HIV/AIDS and many types of cancer.

We own certain proprietary formulations, processes and other intellectual property which can be used to produce our Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals in connection with our ACT Now Program. These products, which are made with unique combinations of pharmaceutically active cannabinoids, provide a comprehensive solution designed to enable physicians and patients to design, implement and monitor effective therapy protocols.

Competition

Currently, we are primarily engaged in the business of providing consulting and advisory services and licensing our intellectual property to businesses or persons who are already in the marijuana business or who desire to enter the business. There are a large number of other public and private companies which compete with us in this area. These competitors include MedBox, Inc., Advanced Cannabis Solutions, Inc., Growlife, Inc., Terra Tech Corp., American Cannabis Company, Americann, Inc. and Monarch America, Inc. (formerly Cannabis Kinetics, Inc.). We believe that our principal competitive advantages are the reputations and experience of our principals in the industry.

The recent growth in the industry, has attracted many businesses trying to enter the market. Some of our competitors have greater capital resources and facilities which may enable them to compete more effectively in this market. Due to this competition, there is no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in generating revenues. If we are unable to successfully compete with existing companies and new entrants to the market, this will have a negative impact on our business and financial condition.

Government Regulation
 
Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law.

A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence. If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in Colorado with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
As of January 31, 2018, 29 states and the District of Columbia allowed their citizens to use Medical Marijuana. Additionally, voters in the states of Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon and the District of Columbia approved ballot measures to legalize cannabis for recreational use by adults. The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. 

The previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. In this regard, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General of the Obama administration issued a memorandum (the Cole Memo) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA.

The Cole Memo noted that the Department of Justice is committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provided guidance to Department of Justice attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following in preventing:

·
 the distribution of cannabis to minors;
 ·
 revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels;
 ·
 the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some for to other states;
 ·
 state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
 ·
 violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis;
 ·
 drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use;
 ·
 the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and
 ·
 cannabis possession or use on federal property.

On January 4, 2018, the U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued the Sessions Memo stating that the Cole Memo was rescinded effectively immediately. In particular, Mr. Sessions stated that prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions, which require federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community. Mr. Sessions went on to state in the memorandum that previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately. 

It is unclear at this time whether the Sessions Memo indicates that the Trump administration will strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis or what types of activities will be targeted for enforcement.

However, on March 31, 2018 President Trump signed a $1.3 trillion budget bill that includes a provision that prevents the Justice Department, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, from using funds to arrest or prosecute patients, caregivers and businesses that are acting in compliance with state medical marijuana laws. This provision, known as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, prohibits the Justice Department from using federal funds to interfere with state medical marijuana programs.

Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, an adverse effect on our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition, or results of operations.

Intellectual Property

Our intellectual property includes our managements knowledge and know-how relating to the legalized growth, production, manufacture, marketing, management, utilization and distribution of medical and recreational marijuana and marijuana infused products. It also includes a genetic catalogue including over 150 different strains of marijuana, and an advanced cannabinoid therapy program called A.C.T. Now.

On August 15, 2017, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued to us U.S. Patent #9730911 granting exclusive rights to our proprietary formulations based on compounds extracted from cannabis plant materials; more specifically the composition of matter pertaining to the use of phytocannabinoids, cannabinoids, and specific terpene profiles in liquid form. This composition of matter Patent provides protection for our proprietary formulations. The Patent protects the use of suspending both phytocannabinoids and cannabinoids with specific combinations of cannabis derived terpenes in liquid forms with an array of delivery methods including capsule, sublingual, topical, oral, suppository, and vaporization. Cannabinoids referenced in the application include ratios of tetra- hydrocannabinolic acid (THCa), cannabidiolic acid (CBDa), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabinol (CBN), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabichromenic acid (CBCa), and cannabichromene (CBC).

Employees

As of March 31, 2018, we had seventeen employees. There is no union representation of our employees, and we have never experienced an involuntary work stoppage. We believe that our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Effect of Environmental Laws

We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as the environmental laws and regulations of the foreign federal and local jurisdictions in which we have operations. We believe we are in material compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations.
