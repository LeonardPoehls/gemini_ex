Atmel Corporation Business Combination and License Agreements
 
On April 16, 2015 (the “Closing Date”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, Uni-Pixel Displays, Inc. (“Displays”), acquired from Atmel Corporation (“Atmel”), pursuant to the terms of a Purchase and Sale Agreement, a Patent License Agreement, an IP License Agreement, a Bill of Sale and Assignment and Assumption Agreement and two leases for real property, certain assets used for the production of capacitive touch sensors comprised of fine lines of copper metal photo lithographically patterned and plated on flexible plastic film (the “Touch Sensors”). Displays paid $450,000 for the machinery, parts and equipment needed to manufacture the Touch Sensors and the existing inventory on hand by issuing to Atmel a secured promissory note (the “Atmel Note”) which has been fully paid.

Through the Patent License Agreement, Atmel licensed to Displays a non-sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under its Touch Sensors patents to make or have made, use, offer for sale, sell and import the Touch Sensors. In consideration for this license, Displays agreed to pay an annual royalty fee during the initial five year term of the license (the “Initial Term”) of the greater of $3.25 million or 3.33% of the total net sales of the Touch Sensors during the Initial Term. Displays has the unilateral right to renew the license for a term of 10 years. If Displays exercises this right, the annual royalty fee will consist of 2.5% of the total net sales of the Touch Sensors until it reaches a total of $16.75 million, at which time no further annual royalty fees will be due. Upon execution of the Patent License Agreement, Displays paid a non-refundable, non-returnable prepayment of minimum annual royalty fees of $9.33 million (the “Royalty Prepayment”). The Royalty Prepayment will be applied to the annual royalty fees Displays owes under the Patent License Agreement. If, during the Initial Term, Displays’ cash balances as of the quarter end immediately prior to the date of the royalty period to which an unpaid annual royalty relates is less than $30 million, it may pay the annual royalty fee with a secured promissory note. Atmel has agreed that it will not enter into a license agreement for the licensed patents that is effective prior to the second anniversary of the closing date.
 
Through the IP License Agreement, Atmel licensed to Displays a non-sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-free license to the intellectual property necessary to make or have made, use, offer for sale, sell and import the Touch Sensors. The term of the IP License Agreement is co-extensive with the term of the Patent License Agreement. Atmel has agreed that it will not enter into a license agreement for the licensed intellectual property that is effective prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date.
 
On February 15, 2017, Displays and Atmel and Atmel’s successor, Microchip Technology (Barbados) II Inc., entered into a Letter Agreement Amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Patent License Agreement and the IP License Agreement (collectively with the Patent License Agreement, the “License Agreements”). The Amendment adds an affiliate of Atmel, Microchip Technology (Barbados) II Inc., as a party to the License Agreements. The Amendment also revises the respective License Agreements to provide that the licenses granted under the License Agreements allow for Displays to enter into a non-transferable, non-assignable, non-exclusive, royalty-bearing sublicense solely to General Interface Solution Limited, a Samoa corporation (“GIS”), to make, use offer for sale, sell and import Licensed XSense Products (as defined in the License Agreements), subject to certain terms provided for in the Amendment. Furthermore, the Amendment provides that if a sublicense agreement is in effect at the time that the License Agreements are terminated for any reason, then such sublicense will survive and remain in full force and effect with Atmel having assumed such sublicense agreement.
 
The Amendment increases the annual royalty rate for all sales of Licensed XSense Products by the Company under the Patent License Agreement, not including any sublicense arrangement, to 4%. The Amendment also provides that the definition of Sales Price (which is used to calculate the royalty rate) in the Patent License Agreement means the gross revenue recognized by the Company from the sale, use or other disposition of a TouchScreen by the Company. In addition, the Amendment adds that the Company shall pay Atmel a separate royalty rate of 5.7% for any GIS sublicenses, based on the manufacturing costs used by the Company to calculate the royalty payable under its sublicense agreement with GIS (the “Sublicense Price”), provided always that the Sublicense Price shall be reflect an arm’s length transaction between a willing licensor and a willing licensee and be no less than the manufacturing cost incurred by other manufacturers involving the most similar products sold in the same volume in an arms-length transaction, as reasonably determined by Displays and auditable by Atmel. A minimum of 4% of the 5.7% royalty rate owed to Atmel for a sublicense agreement with GIS must be paid in cash, in which case the remaining 1.7% will be paid to Atmel in the Company’s stock or other consideration as mutually agreed upon by the parties. Furthermore, the maximum cumulative annual royalties payable for the GIS sublicense is $13,250,000. Royalties from the GIS sublicense are separate from and do not count toward the minimum annual royalty amount paid for Display’s license under the Patent License Agreement during the Initial Term, the maximum cumulative annual royalties during the Renewal Period (as such term is defined in the Patent License Agreement), nor the calculation of when the Royalty Prepayment has been fully used and credited.
 
As part of the business combination, Displays also entered into leases with Atmel Corporation for Building 2 and Building 4, both of which are located at 1150 E. Cheyenne Mountain Boulevard, Colorado Springs, Colorado. The term of each lease was 18 months (the “Primary Lease Term”). The term of each lease was extended through October 17, 2018 with two additional renewal periods expiring on October 16, 2020. We believe that Building 2 and Building 4 are currently suitable for the operations related to the manufacture and distribution of the Touch Sensors.
 
Displays also acquired from CIT Technology Limited, an FLT (Fine Line Technology) Patent License Agreement and an FLT (Fine Line Technology) Intellectual Property License Agreement, which agreements were amended on December 21, 2016, and entered into an agreement for the provision of manufacturing and technology transfer services.

Our patent-pending Copperhead technology used in conjunction with the fine line technology (“FLT”) technology enables a high-fidelity manufacturing process to create complex micro-electronic patterns that enable what we believe are revolutionary new electronic printed circuits, such as projected capacitive touch sensors. We believe that the combined Copperhead and FLT process can dramatically simplify and reduce the complexity, cost and risk of manufacturing Touch Sensors and other electronic circuit applications. We are manufacturing and selling copper-based touch sensor films made by a combination of the in-licensed Atmel Technology, the FLT and the Copperhead process as an alternative to traditional indium tin oxide (“ITO”) coated transparent materials used in a variety of electronic products. We believe the combined technologies will establish several patented competitive advantages over existing ITO and other metal mesh touch sensor technologies. These advantages include: sensor mesh designs that permit the thinnest cover lens, the lowest effective sheet resistance to enable the narrowest borders and passive stylus, patterning and processing of both sides of the substrate to produce one of the thinnest sensors and roll to roll manufacturing processes to lower device production cost. The resulting technology advantages allow our customers, PC and Tablet OEMs and Original Design Manufacturers or ODMs, to reduce their product overall thickness, overall product footprint, weight, lower manufacturing costs and offer performance features such as passive stylus. Furthermore, this process is adaptive with polymer substrates and as a result may enable the production of flexible displays.
 
Additionally, during the development of our PEF technology, we were able to produce an ultra-hard coat surface, Diamond Guard®, which can be applied to plastic films and substrates to improve the scratch and abrasion resistance of these surfaces. We intend to apply Diamond Guard® to our XTouch™ sensors to lower sensor product costs and to enable new sensor products that are thinner and lighter. We also are working with third party coating manufacturers to develop Diamond Guard® as a coating for a variety of applications. We are initially focusing on the application of Diamond Guard® in the coating of acrylic plastic sheets to replace glass cover lenses in tablets and smart phones.
 
Our Target Markets
 
We are currently focusing our efforts on applications of our PEFs in the following areas:
 
Transparent Electrically Conductive Films
 
Our recent combination of the Atmel Technology, the FLT and the Copperhead process will enable us to enter a large and growing market for transparent touch screens. We believe this technology is a superior alternative to ITO as the transparent conducting layer in a touch screen device. Based upon calculations derived from DisplaySearch, on the worldwide touch panel market, we believe that the global film market for touch sensors could be $3 billion-$5 billion annually over the next five years. Our transparent electronically conductive films can be produced based on the combination of the Atmel Technology, the FLT and the Copperhead process at low cost and on large flexible polymer roll substrates. We believe this enables manufacturers to effectively produce large area touch screens at commercially viable costs with enhanced performance and functionality. In addition, we believe that the insertion of this technology into smaller devices will lead to thinner, lighter, lower cost and higher efficiency products. We intend to sell the touch screen films as sub-components of a touch sensor module.
 
We are currently working with touch screen manufacturers and OEMs to design products based on our technology.
 
Diamond Guard® Cover Glass replacement and Protective Cover Films
 
We have designed, developed and demonstrated production capabilities of micro-structured and hard coated films for use as cover glass replacement and protective cover films for touch and multi-touch electronic computing devices. We believe that our Diamond Guard® hard coat materials are unique in the market as compared to other similar products because our hard coat surface treatments offer better functional specifications as compared to competitive films. We are currently in discussions with various third party coating manufacturers and plastic component manufacturers to sell our Diamond Guard® hard coat resin.
Industry Background
 
The Touch Sensor Market
 
Proliferation of Touch-Enabled Mobile Consumer Electronics Devices. Consumers throughout the world are rapidly adopting mobile consumer electronics devices such as smartphones, mini and full-size tablet computers, touch enabled notebook computers, All-In-One computers, mobile gaming devices and digital cameras. Advances in component technology are driving down the cost of these products and expanding their functionality. Early mobile devices were equipped with small displays with limited functionality. As the cost of color displays decreased and quality improved, consumers began rapidly adopting mobile devices with color displays. This trend towards greater functionality in mobile devices continues with the development of smartphones with touch sensors, ultra-high resolution displays, embedded cameras and high-speed data networking capability.

The overall touch sensor enabled computer electronics industry is continuing to experience significant growth. The industry growth is being driven by a number of market forces including:
 

● | Increased demand for large format high resolution televisions and computer monitors; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Steady growth in usage of smartphones, phablets, tablet computers, notebooks and All-In-One computers; 
● | The increasing use of touch in gaming applications; 
● | The popularity of combined stylus and finger touch in tablets and 2 in 1 devices; 
● | A migration to larger color screens, which are multi-touch enabled, for smartphones and other mobile devices; and 
● | A migration to higher resolution screens; 
● | Up and coming flexible displays: and 
● | Decreasing costs, increasing production and improving efficiency as a newer generation of smart mobile devices are increasingly being produced. 

 
These factors in combination with additional market forces are driving overall growth and shifting the mix of product applications within the touch-enabled device industry.
 
Applications. With the enormous growth in Internet usage, there has not only been an explosion in the amount of available content, but a rapid evolution of the form in which it appears. No longer is information a two-dimensional, text-only experience; online content is now being delivered in graphic rich, animated and video formats. As the sophistication of the user base continues to heighten and bandwidth continues to increase, we believe there will be increasing demand for superior, high-resolution visual and touch experiences. Flowing from this demand, we expect that new types of applications and functionality will evolve that, in turn, will enhance existing markets and create new ones. The continued evolution of technologies such as touch-enabled notebook computers tablet computers and smartphones, and the ability to connect all of these devices through mobile high-speed data networks, will likely fuel significant demand and, therefore, growth in what have become relatively mature markets. The devices that deliver this rich user experience will generally have two things in common: high resolution displays and touch interfaces. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of these growing markets with our Diamond Guard® hard coat and XTouch™ flexible printed touch sensors.
 
Films for Displays. Glass and plastics are the principal materials being used as first surfaces for display systems. Because displays are incorporated into devices that are used extensively and are transportable, the displays are subject to damage and the effects of use in challenging environments. A large and growing business has developed in films that are designed to provide protection and other functional uses on top of the display surface. The technologies that we have developed and are currently developing can be applied to a variety of functional uses in films for display products. Our Diamond Guard® hard coat resin can be applied to plastic film and sheets to produce a protective cover film product that can be used to protect touch screen devices from scratches while providing a transparency and gloss equivalent to glass. In other embodiments, our Diamond Guard® coating can be applied to substrates that can be used as the first surface of hand held electronic devices or cover plastic parts that could form the shell casing for mobile electronic devices. Diamond Guard® coating can be used in application with other materials to replace the current cover glass and enable softer plastics to be used in external cases and other components that have been heretofore dominated by glass or metal parts. We believe our Diamond Guard® coating will be less expensive to manufacture and install in addition to being lighter and more shatter and scratch resistant.
 
Comparing Touch Screen Technologies
 
The touch screen is one of the easiest interfaces to use, making it the interface of choice for a wide variety of applications. Accordingly, there are several technologies that compete to capitalize on this market. The more commonly used technologies are resistive, capacitive (mainly projected capacitive or pro-cap), infrared grid, acoustic and optical. Projected capacitive touch technology comprises approximately 90% of touch sensor units shipped today. Resistive touch technology comprises approximately 9% of the touch sensor units and the remaining technologies comprise the other 1% of the touch sensors units shipped. Pro-cap touch sensor units are projected to grow, while resistive touch sensors units are projected to shrink, while the remaining technologies will occupy less than 1% of total end market in units. Our XTouch™ touch sensor is a pro-cap touch sensor technology. We compete with a variety of ITO (indium tin oxide) based pro-cap touch sensor technologies. The following table is a comparison of ITO based pro-cap touch sensor technologies.

We are targeting leading display, materials and electronics manufacturers as potential partners and/or integrators of our Performance Engineered Film™ (PEF) products. We will provide technical assistance and support to manufacturers who are evaluators, developers or users of our protective cover and XTouch™ touch screen films. We also employ a “pull through” strategy (targeting end device OEMs) by actively marketing the advantages of our technologies to the manufacturers that incorporate touch screen technology into their devices. This could result in our production partners gaining access to the OEM supply chain as OEMs seek the competitive product advantages offered by our Performance Engineered Film™ technologies. We also target ODMs targeted to assemble our sub-components and films into OEM products. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Drive Adoption by End-Product Original Equipment Manufacturers. We also plan to employ a “pull through” strategy with OEMs and ODMs that produce end user products by demonstrating our technology. We believe that the significant advantages that our films will offer in performance and protection may induce additional OEMs to request our solutions from their existing suppliers. 
● | Enhance Our Existing Performance Engineered Film™ Technology. We believe that continuing development and enhancement of our PEF technology is critical to our success, therefore, we engage in internal development efforts that we expect will expand our intellectual property portfolio, collaborative relationships and other strategic opportunities. Our primary focus is to expand our intellectual property through development of additional prototypes and materials that enhance and extend our product capabilities or the processes by which the systems are produced, thereby allowing them to be used in a broader array of applications. 
● | Develop Prototypes Suitable for Industry Demonstration. We have produced prototypes with a performing system and film products that we believe have superior touch performance to those currently used in the industry and demonstrate our ability to meet OEM product requirements. We have the capability at our Colorado Springs manufacturing facility to run prototype films and products to demonstrate our production solutions for all applications. 
● | Manufacturing Facility and Process. We maintain a manufacturing facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The facility is equipped with the equipment and infrastructure required to supply commercial level shipments to our current customers and prospective customers. The manufacturing process is conducted in a clean room environment and employs roll-to-roll film production and advanced chemical and photolithographic processes. We manufacture in a clean environment utilizing a combination of Class 1000 and Class 100 clean rooms. 

 
We plan ongoing research on the use of a variety of different thin-film technologies in surface modification applications and the construction of multi-layer stacks where micro-structures can play unique functional roles, such as our current XTouch™ sensor construction and advances to XTouch™ sensor construction. Our focus on next-generation technologies is designed to help establish us as a recognized provider of Performance Engineered Film™ as new markets and applications emerge.
 
Customers and Partners
 
Our current and, we believe, our future customers for the XTouch™ electronic film touch sensors will be the device manufacturers and OEMs that currently use touch screens with the LCD and OLED displays in their products.
 
We expect our future Diamond Guard® hard coat resin customers to include a variety of third party coating manufacturers, plastic component manufacturers and channel distribution partners.
 
Current and Targeted Partners

Sales and Marketing
 
We are seeking end user product OEMs that desire to integrate XTouch™ touch screens and Diamond Guard® hard coat offerings into their products. We believe that some of the OEMs that have been engaged in these discussions will be interested in pursuing the advantages of XTouch™ touch screens and Diamond Guard® films as a differentiator for their products relative to their competition in their individual market segments. We believe that the proven entry into a single vertical market or application will drive the demand for that product for expanded applications to other product markets.
 
Our sales strategy intends to build a diverse revenue base that will derive revenues from multiple sources:
 

● | Product revenues — Proceeds from the sales of Performance Engineered Film™ products from retail and wholesale channels. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Critical materials — Proceeds from the sales of Performance Engineered Film™ products to integrators or manufacturers that produce or assemble devices with touch screens. 
● | Engineering support contracts — Integrators that are seeking to differentiate their products by leveraging the unique attributes that our Performance Engineered Film™ or Diamond Guard™ resin can potentially provide. 

 
Currently, we are introducing our products to OEMs in various market segments. We do this by demonstrating the advantages that our Performance Engineered Film™ can provide in the form of improved efficiencies and performance. We expect to continue to create OEM and ODM interest in our products by gaining design wins for integration of protective cover films and XTouch™ printed electronic film into established end user devices and applications.
 
Our plan is to advance our brand in the industry by actively demonstrating to OEMs the elegance and performance advantages of our unique solutions. As we ship our initial products and we begin to build momentum, we may launch various marketing programs to drive awareness of our technology as a component “brand” within the end user products. We expect that these marketing programs will be designed to drive awareness and education of our unique capabilities and enhanced performance among OEMs and wholesale and retail channels. We believe that we will be able to promote our brand as a valued component brand included within the OEM products as a part of our relationship with the end product OEMs. Ultimately the goal of this marketing program will be to:
 

● | establish us and our unique technologies, independently, as a differentiating factor in end user products; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | help promote our value as a component product through the inclusion by our partner OEMs of our Performance Engineered Film™ technology in their products; and 
● | promote the pen sensitivity advantage of our sensor technology. Pen sensitivity allows OEMs to move to lower cost passive pens vs the currently used active pens present in Microsoft and Apple tablet products. 

 
In addition we will periodically attend trade shows where our targeted customers can be expected to have a presence.
 
Research and Development
 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we spent approximately $7.9 million and $6.8 million, respectively, on research and development activities. We continue conducting research and development both internally and externally and anticipate material additional investments going forward.
 
Our development activities are located in our laboratory in The Woodlands, Texas and Colorado Springs, CO. The laboratories house our chemistry and testing operations where Diamond Guard® and all PEF materials development and testing is conducted. The Colorado Springs facility includes a Class 1000 clean room.
 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries and benefits, costs to third party contractors to perform research or other activities related to our business, professional fees related to intellectual property work and facilities costs. The materials used in our research and development and in the manufacturing of our Diamond Guard® and PEF films are readily available for purchase in the open market.
 
Manufacturing
 
Our XTouch™ touch screens products are primarily manufactured in our facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The manufacturing process is conducted in a clean room environment and employs roll-to-roll film production and advanced chemical and photolithographic processes. The facility is equipped with equipment and infrastructure required to produce commercial level shipment to our current and prospective customers.

Our roll to roll process consists of a number of sequential steps to produce our XTouch™ touch sensor onto PET film. A basecoat comprised of a catalyst impregnated photoresist is applied to both sides of a PET film. As part of the license agreement with Conductive Inkjet Technology (CIT) we transferred the basecoating process for the basecoated PET film to our coating equipment in the Colorado Springs facility in the fourth quarter of 2015. The basecoating operation in-house has resulted in substantial manufacturing cost savings and yield improvements.
 
Photolithographic equipment exposes the basecoat material with the XTouch™ touch sensor circuit pattern. Both sides of the PET film are exposed simultaneously. The expose - plating system develops the exposed basecoat material and the remaining patterned basecoat PET is plated with copper using an electroless plating chemistry.
 
The patterned, copper plated PET film is then processed by a second chemical plating process to apply a second metal for darkening the copper to enhance visual performance and to improve the environmental reliability.
 
A polymer overcoat is applied to the patterned PET film utilizing precision film coating equipment. We have started to replace the current polymer overcoat with Diamond Guard®. Diamond Guard® applied to our XTouch™ sensor will lower sensor product costs and enable new sensor products that are thinner and lighter.
 
Outgoing quality checks are performed on the XTouch™ sensor film, including 100% electrical test and visual inspection. Protective shipping liner are applied to both sides of the XTouch™ sensor film and film is singulated into individual sensors prior to being packaged into shipping containers.
 
We believe the manufacturing facility and process equipment are capable of supporting current and future production requirements through 2017 without significant capital expenditure.
 
Intellectual Property Summary
 
As a company primarily focused on developing new technologies, we expect that our most valuable asset will be our intellectual property. This includes U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications, registered trademarks, common-law trademarks, trade secrets and know-how. We are pursuing an aggressive intellectual property strategy.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 7 patents issued and 45 pending. In addition, as a component of the acquisition of the Atmel touch screen sensor business, we have a license for the Atmel and CIT technology which include 44 patents and 93 pending. Our issued U.S. patents will expire between September 2025 and April 2033.
 
We have also registered the marks “UniPixel®” and “Diamond Guard®” and filed for registration of the mark “XTouch™” on the principal register of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We rely on a combination of patent and trademark filings, laws that protect intellectual property, confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions with our employees and others, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights.
 
COMPETITION
 
The industry in which we operate is highly competitive. While existing touch screen technologies based on the use of indium tin oxide (ITO) currently dominate the marketplace, we will be more specifically competing against other emerging technologies that also seek to improve the performance of touch screen systems. It is our objective to enable the existing touch module assembly infrastructure to incorporate the use of XTouch™ touch screen films into their current manufacturing and assembly operations. In this way, we believe XTouch™ touch screen products can penetrate the touch screen industry quicker and overcome the resistance to change. Given the potential advantages that we believe the XTouch™ touch screen films offer, we believe that this should be a relatively quick, inexpensive and profitable process for these manufacturers.
 
Compared to our competition, we believe we follow a more broadly developed business model allowing us to benefit from the following factors:
 

● | A wide range of opportunities to enter the market; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The flexibility to pursue multiple entry points to multiple market segments; 
● | The ability to be a supplier of key materials; 
● | The ability to be nimble and make decisions quickly in the market; and 
● | The ability to leverage established infrastructures. 

 
The suppliers of metal mesh touch sensor technology, which formerly were numerous, are now concentrated in three companies of which our company is one.

EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 93 full-time employees and no part-time employees. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. We also employ consultants on an as-needed basis to supplement existing staff.

We are not aware of any current federal, state or local environmental compliance regulations that have a material effect on our business activities.
