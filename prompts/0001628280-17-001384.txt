Item 1. Business.
General Overview
Lapolla is a leading United States based manufacturer and global distributor of foam, coatings and equipment, focused on developing and commercializing foams and coatings targeted at commercial and industrial and residential applications in the insulation and construction industries. We believe that being vertically integrated in both foam and coating systems puts Lapolla in a strong competitive position as both product lines reduce energy consumption and ultimately lead to direct savings for consumers. Lapolla’s products address growing consumer awareness of the building envelope. The building envelope is the separation between the interior and the exterior environments of a building and serves as the outer shell to protect the indoor environment as well as to facilitate its climate control. Building envelopes with increased insulation levels are becoming standard practice. Consumers are increasingly involved in the selection of green building products due to rising energy costs and the recent availability of tax credits and energy rebates.
Operating Segments
We manage our business through two business segments - Foam and Coatings. The Foam segment involves producing, and in limited instances applying through subcontractors, building envelope insulation foam for interior application, and roofing systems. The Coatings segment involves producing protective elastomeric coatings and primers. Both segments include supplying equipment and related ancillary items used in the application of our products. Information about our business should be read together with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Foam Segment
Our foam business involves supplying spray polyurethane foam for insulation and roofing to the construction industry. Lapolla provides open and closed cell spray polyurethane foams for insulation, as well as closed cell technology for roofing applications.
Principal Products and Services and Markets
Spray foam insulation applications consist of perimeter wall, crawl space, and attic space for commercial, industrial, and residential applications. Roofing applications consist of new and retrofit commercial, industrial, and residential applications.
Open-cell spray foam technology is a cost-effective solution to improve the energy efficiency of a building. The material expands to 120 times its initial volume and fills cavities of any shape providing a continuous, protective air barrier that helps to minimize air leakage and air intrusion. Open-cell foam insulation is a performance upgrade over conventional insulation that leads to energy efficiency, improved occupant comfort, a cleaner indoor environment and greater noise reduction for building/home owners.
Closed-cell spray foam insulation is one of the most efficient insulating materials commercially available, with aged R-Values above 6.0 per inch. The description “closed-cell” comes from the cell structure of the finished insulation material. One cubic inch of polyurethane foam insulation contains millions of tiny plastic thermal resistant closed cells. The blowing agent is captured within the cells, which contributes to highly efficient insulating properties. In addition, closed-cell foam provides an inherent air barrier with low moisture vapor permeability, and excellent resistance to water. The density for closed-cell spray foam is approximately two pounds per cubic foot. The medium density foam provides sheer and racking strength to wall assemblies in building applications. The solid nature and sealing capability of closed-cell spray foam, inhibits moisture-driven elements.
Lapolla was the first manufacturer to globally offer a third party tested and approved wall foam system that uses the Solstice® Liquid Blowing Agent (“Solstice LBA”). Lapolla achieved this fourth generation (4G) benchmark while working closely with Honeywell to incorporate the Solstice LBA, a next-generation blowing agent from Honeywell. The product not only improves foam performance, but also delivers environmental benefits. Solstice LBA has an ultra-low global warming potential of 1, which is 99.9 percent lower than today’s most commonly-used blowing agent, HFC-245fa, a hydrofluorocarbon, while retaining its insulating performance. Solstice LBA is nonflammable, has received Environmental Protection Agency approval under the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) Program and is not a volatile organic compound.
We have attained, and continue to attain, third party credentials for our spray polyurethane foam systems, which means our products are tested by independent parties to meet applicable building and construction codes, thereby enabling greater acceptance of our proprietary foam products in our target markets globally. This segment also supplies adhesives and equipment for applications. We use our own distribution facility, as well as public warehousing in strategic local areas in our target markets, to serve customers. Technology, performance, availability, product credentials, approvals, technical and customer service, and pricing are major competitive factors in our foam business.
The Foam segment includes revenue from The AirTight Division. The AirTight Division primarily focuses on marketing, promoting, and selling energy saving products and energy reduction services through subcontractors. The AirTight Multi-Family Energy Savings Program is a turn-key project service that provides energy assessments and analysis with the assistance of independent consultants, project design, regulatory assistance to facilitate potential rebates from state and utility authorities, and project management services. The program is designed to save landlords substantial energy costs while dramatically reducing a property's carbon footprint and increasing the tenant's comfort.

Coating Segment
Our coatings business involves supplying protective coatings for roofing and wall systems for new and retrofit commercial and industrial applications to the roofing and construction industries. Lapolla provides an economical and effective roof coating system for application over new and existing roof substrates.
Principal Products and Services and Markets
Spray polyurethane foam roofing consists of two components: (i) a closed-cell polyurethane foam insulation; and (ii) a protective coating. The polyurethane foam adheres to the building substrate and any items that penetrate the roof surface, making it self-flashing and giving it resistance to high winds. Spray polyurethane foams also offer enhanced impact resistance. Roofs featuring spray polyurethane foam can last 20 to 30 years with minimal maintenance requirements. While sprayed foam can be applied to a new roof, the majority of applications involve reroofing as spray polyurethane roofing can be applied over an existing roof without requiring the removal of the old roof. Spray polyurethane foam roofing is particularly suited for roofs with unusual configurations or with multiple penetrations, as the sprayed material is self-flashing. Coatings often wear or need replacement before the foam, resulting in less tear offs and reducing waste. Spray polyurethane foam roofs are also selected by architects and designers because they can be coated with compounds that enhance reflectivity. Thus, spray polyurethane foam roofs can be considered cool roofs. Additionally, spray polyurethane foam is an excellent insulator and increases the energy efficiency of a building.
Thermo-Flex™ products include technologically advanced, high solid, fire retardant, thixotropic, acrylic, elastomeric coatings uniquely formulated for the protection of spray polyurethane foam insulation. Its various formulations are designed to withstand the intense heat and ultra-violet rays of low humidity desert environments and damp heat and ultra-violet rays of humid environments.
Thermo-Prime™ products are single component, water based, acrylic primers that promote adhesion of spray polyurethane foam to a variety of roofing substrates including built-up roof (BUR), modified bitumen, concrete, masonry, galvanized metal and wood, and eliminate odor problems normally associated with solvent borne primers.
Thermo-Caulk™ products are single component, water-based, high performance, elastomeric, knife-grade caulking, that when cured forms a tough, flexible membrane that seals out moisture. The products are used as a waterproof sealer for roof seams, termination points, cracks, flashing, vents, skylights, fasteners, parapets, protrusions and duct work. They can also be used with roof fabric for three coursing weak areas of the roof.
We use our own distribution facility, as well as public warehousing in strategic local areas in our target markets to better serve our customers. Product credentials, approvals and performance, pricing, technology, technical customer service, and availability are major competitive factors in our coatings business.
Industries
The industries in which we operate involve the sale and distribution of spray polyurethane foam, coatings and the equipment used in such application process. We manufacture our spray polyurethane foam and coating products and purchase equipment manufactured by large global manufacturers.  The majority of our products are sold to contractors and distributors that apply the products or sell to local contractors.
We believe the demand for spray polyurethane foam and reflective roof coatings is growing rapidly due to enhanced consumer awareness due to energy efficiency programs promoted by governmental agencies, energy companies, and private organizations and building code changes that call for houses to be better sealed to prevent air leaks. According to the Freedonia Group, U.S. demand for plastic foams is forecast to increase 2.3 percent annually to 8.8 billion pounds in 2020, valued at $25.2 billion. We believe that this growth reflects the advantages of spray polyurethane foam as an insulator and a means of saving energy. Underlying factors driving plastic foams demand include general economic conditions, construction activity, manufacturing output, population growth, and advantages over competitive materials such as fiberglass.  Demand for spray polyurethane foam can be cyclical, however, and can be negatively impacted by depressed construction markets and general economic conditions. Environmental and regulatory issues may additionally influence the market as changing building codes and higher energy efficiency standards can affect demand for plastic foam insulation.
Demand for commercial roofing products is forecast to grow as well. According to the Freedonia Group, US demand for commercial roofing products is forecast to advance 1.6 percent per year to 110 million squares in 2020, valued at $9.2 billion. Reroofing applications have historically accounted for the larger share of demand and we believe will continue to do so going forward. Many commercial structures -- particular those large in size -- feature low-slope roofs susceptible to damage caused by moisture, impacts, and general wear and tear. We believe building owners and managers looking to save money over the long term will increasingly implement regular inspection and maintenance programs to repair and replace damaged roofing materials. In many cases, these newly installed products will feature enhanced performance properties or can serve as cool roofing to lower utility bills. Plastic roofing, including spray polyurethane foam, has overtaken bituminous membranes as the leading commercial roofing material installed in the US, which we believe will see above-average gains in demand through 2020, totaling 34.4 million squares. We believe demand for plastic roofing will be supported by its favorable performance properties, ease of installation, and suitability for use as cool roofing. Demand for roofing depends on patterns in building construction, as the only applications for roofing products are in new structures, additions to existing structures, and repair or reroofing of existing structures. Nonresidential building construction activity is closely related to trends in the business cycle, interest rates, and the effects of previous building activity on the supply of structures within a given area.

Sales and Marketing
We maintain a growing global sales force. Sales are concentrated on contractors and distributors in the insulation and roofing industries. Lapolla utilizes direct sales, independent sales representatives and distributors, and stores its products in select public warehouses that it does not own to increase penetration in select target markets and facilitate availability of products for customers. Lapolla utilizes advertising campaigns, articles in industry periodicals, trade show exposure, public relations, printed case studies, Internet and website exposure, mailers and direct sales, distribution, and marketing to obtain greater product branding and recognition. Lapolla places a high priority on sales trending to create preparedness and processes to better serve customers. Information is gathered from sales, customers, management experience, and historical trending to predict needed supply for stock and warehousing to meet the needs of customers on a timely basis. Public warehousing, distribution and direct sales allow us to supply customers in a timely and efficient manner. The combined volumes of our products are disbursed throughout a broad customer base, which decreases vulnerability from the loss of one key customer. Most of our significant customers are contractors and general distributors that apply and resell our products for insulation and energy efficiency.  They generally do not provide us with data on where they apply our products.  Our sales are affected by our contractors and the level of our distributors’ inventory and their ability to resell such inventory, which in turn is affected by industry trends.  Our marketing and growth strategies are aimed at meeting the needs of our contractors and distributors and providing whatever products they may need at any given time rather than targeting any one particular product or seeking to expand our sales into any particular region of the world.
International
We have a global presence. Our international presence represented approximately 4.53% and 4.47% of our total product sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We use independent distributors to provide access to our products internationally in select target markets.
Competition
Competition is based on a combination of product credentials, approvals, price, technology, availability, performance, and limited warranties. Lapolla is expanding through aggressive sales and marketing, competitive pricing, a selective sales force comprised of direct salespersons, independent representatives, and distributors, and building owner and contractor brand awareness. 
Lapolla differentiates itself from competitors by offering personalized sales support and providing efficient response time on issues ranging from technical service to delivery of products. Product credentials and approvals differentiate product lines and suppliers that are more readily suited to broad use and industry acceptance. We currently maintain certain credentials and approvals to assure minimal restrictions in markets and uses.
Within the industries for our products, we believe that we are a market leader with prices generally competitive with those of our competitors. More specifically, our customers generally purchase foam and coatings products from a select few sources besides us, and our products generally comprise a large percentage of the foam and coatings products purchased by our customers. In addition, we offer customers technical service and training unlike many of our competitors.  We believe the fact that most of our customers find it important to maintain us as a valued supplier, coupled with our highly credentialed products, competitive prices and a high level of service has shielded us from the potential negative impact of volatility in raw material prices that affects our industry as a whole.
Foam
We are one of the largest suppliers of spray polyurethane foam for insulation and roofing foam in the United States and are expanding globally. The foam manufacturing industry consists of a limited number of large and medium sized manufacturing companies with global, national and regional presence primarily relying on distributors to service markets. We are able to access distribution channels and penetrate target markets through direct sales more effectively as a manufacturer of foam resins (versus being just a distributor). Our products are supplied to large, medium and small insulation, roofing, and general contractors, as well as selective distributors with connections to local markets in target areas.
In large volume insulation areas, foamed plastic intensely competes with fiberglass and, to a lesser extent, mineral wool and cellulose. We believe that the physical characteristics of foamed plastic give us a competitive advantage in this marketplace. The two primary plastic foam insulation materials, polyurethane and polystyrene, generally have higher R-values (the per inch values reflecting the insulating ability of a material) than fiberglass and mineral wool. A material with a high R-value can insulate better and at thinner thicknesses than a material of lower R-value. Foamed plastics are also more versatile and offer a tighter insulation bond by providing a more uniform level of thermal resistance without any material gaps, if properly installed. Building codes that call for houses to be more tightly sealed to prevent air leaks may spur builders and homeowners to use spray foams to fill gaps, while foam boards may see increasing use because of their higher R-values.
Coatings
The market for our coatings products is fragmented and characterized by the preferences of the coatings applicators as manufacturers have specifically focused on energy efficient acrylic coatings for roofing and construction as their primary line. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of companies.

Materials and Principal Suppliers
We place a high priority on forecasting material demand to meet customer demands in the most expedient and cost effective manner and manage cash flow. The primary materials incorporated in our foams and coatings are isocyanates, polyols, catalysts, resins, titanium dioxide, and blowing agents. On the supply side, suppliers to our industry include large chemical and equipment companies.  In addition, some of our largest competitors are vertically integrated, selling products they manufactured with raw materials they can source from within.  Maintaining and expanding our relationships and access with our raw material suppliers is critical given our high dependence on the raw materials and equipment we purchase.  Since we purchase mainly from domestic suppliers, the main factor influencing our supply is our ability to maintain and expand our existing relationships with suppliers and add new suppliers.
The suppliers of the necessary raw materials are industry leaders in both the specific chemistries and basic in the manufacturing of the raw materials for supply. The principal suppliers are Wanhua Chemical (America) Co. Ltd., Honeywell International, Inc., DowDuPont, and Evonik Industries AG. Although we maintain strong relationships and have commitments for continuing supply through times of shortage, a lengthy interruption of the supply of one of these materials could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and supply commercial product. With our volume potential, we believe that we are a potentially lucrative target for vendors to assure their own growth and demand in 2017 and beyond. Our foam resins and acrylic coatings are manufactured in our Houston, Texas facility and we maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity to support our current forecasted demand as well as a substantial safety margin of additional capacity to meet peaks of demand and sales growth in excess of our current expectations.
Proprietary Information, Trade Secrets and Trademarks
We rely on our proprietary technologies and trade secrets in our foam and coating segments for finished goods formulations.  Additionally, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our vendors, customers, employees and consultants.
