Item 1. Business
 
Except as otherwise indicated by the context, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “we,” “us” and “our” are to the consolidated business of the Registrant and PGPI.
 
We conduct our operations in Lithia, Florida, from an office in the home of our chief executive officer and we intend to open an office in Ensenada, Mexico. The present office is occupied at no charge to us. There is no rental agreement for the use of this office. If rent were charged for this space, the amount would be insignificant.
 
Background.
 
Originally, on July 16, 1984, we were organized as Lucky Seven Gas and Minerals, Inc., under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania. On June 24, 1996, our name was changed to Lucky Seven Gold Mines, Inc. On January 13, 1998, American Precious Metals, Inc. was formed, under the laws of the State of Delaware. On March 16, 1998, we merged into American Precious Metals, Inc., the surviving corporation. On November 13, 2000, our name was changed to American Global Enterprises, Inc. and on December 21, 2000, our name was changed again to American International Ventures, Inc.
Prior Business Activities.
 
During 2002, we developed a plan of operations to seek, identify and, if successful, acquire a portfolio of undervalued or sub-economic but prospective mineral properties in the United States, principally gold properties that could be enhanced by performing limited exploratory work on the property. We would then attempt to identify a joint venture partner to further develop the property or otherwise sell the property to an industry participant.
 
Pursuant to our then business plan, we acquired twenty-eight (28) patented mining claims on the Bruner property located in Nye County, Nevada.
 
In September 2005, we completed an Exploration and Option to Enter Joint Venture Agreement with Electrum Resources LLC relating to the Bruner property, which agreement was terminated in January 2007. In April 2009, we completed a Property Option Agreement with Patriot Gold Corp., an unaffiliated third party, in which we granted an exclusive option to the Bruner Property (the “Bruner Option”), for eight annual payments totaling $315,000.00 and a balloon payment due to us in April 2016, in the amount of $1,185,000. In addition, we retained a 1.5% net smelter reserve (“NSR”) wherein Patriot Gold has the option to purchase 1% of the NSR for an additional $500,000. On October 23, 2015 we completed sale agreement and option agreement with Canamex Gold a Nevada Corporation for $750,000. 
 
Then, we determined to expand our business purpose to seek other business opportunities to review and analyze for purposes of effecting a merger, acquisition or other business combination with an operating company business.
 
In April 2018, we amended our Certificate of Incorporation to increase our authorized shares of common stock from 400,000,000 shares to 800,000,000 shares.

Description of Placer Gold Prospecting, Inc.’s Business
 
For purposes of this section entitled “Description of Placer Gold Prospecting, Inc.’s Business” only, all references to “we,” “us,” or “our” or “PGPI” refers to PGPI prior to the effectiveness of the Share Exchange.
 
On January 25, 2012, PGPI was incorporated in the State of Florida, for mining exploration. It has acquired mining claims for approximately 4,050 acres of land, primarily in Nevada, with the intent of reactivating the historical mines that produced gold and silver until shut down in 1942 because of World War II. There is no guarantee that such properties will produce gold or silver in the future or that these properties may have already been depleted, as they were previously mined.
 
At this time, our primary focus is on gold and silver properties. Gold and silver properties are wasting assets. They eventually become depleted or uneconomical to continue mining. Currently, we have not produced any gold or silver from our properties. We are in the exploration stage and potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by enterprises in the exploration stage. Our ability to become and remain profitable over the long term depends on our ability to finalize the design, permit, development and profitable extraction and recovery of mineral resources beyond our current planned mine life. If our ability to expand the operations beyond their current planned mined lives doesn’t occur we may seek to acquire other precious and base metals properties beyond our current properties. The acquisition of precious and base metals properties and their exploration and development are subject to intense competition. Companies with greater financial resources, larger staff, more experience and more equipment for exploration and development may be in a better position than us to compete for such mineral properties.

Sale of Mining Claims during Fiscal 2014.
 During fiscal year to 2014, we sold certain mining claims to Gold Mining USA, Inc. (OTC -PINK: GMUI) (“GMU”). On February 4, 2014, the Company completed the sale of certain mining claims to GMU in exchange for 5 million shares of common stock of GMU. The Company reserved a 3% net smelter return on the claims. The claims consist of four unpatented claims and are part of eight claims held by the Company known as the “Gypsy Gold Mine.” In addition, on June 16, 2014, the Company completed the sale of additional unpatented mining claims to GMU in exchange for 1.5 million shares of common stock of GMU and the Company also reserved a 3% net smelter return. The mining claims consist of twenty two unpatented claims known as “El Tule/Rich Gulch” and remaining four unpatented claims which are part of the “Gypsy Gold Mine” claims. All of the claims are located in Douglas County, Nevada
 
Under the February 2014 agreement, the parties further agreed that GMU has the option to purchase the remaining four unpatented claims (part of the Gypsy Gold Mine) in exchange for GMU purchasing a convertible debenture in the amount of $1,000,000 from the Company within six months from the closing of the original transaction (“Debenture”). Under the current June agreement, the Company included these four unpatented mining claims as part of the above described transaction, and the parties agreed that the stock consideration (1.5 million shares of common stock of GMU) satisfied the obligation to purchase the Debenture as required under the January 2014 agreement.

Sale of Bruner Mine. (1) Location: The Bruner mine is located in township 14 north, range 37 east, and encompasses the SE1/4 of section 14, section 23 NE1/4, section 13 SW1/4, and section 24 NE1/4. The Bruner mine is located 76 miles from the town of Fallon Nevada of HWY 361. The Bruner property consists of 28 patented mining claims. 
 (2) The Bruner was optioned in 2008 to Patriot Gold in Las Vegas which made annual payments to the Company under the Option Agreement. The Bruner Property was sold to Canamex resources U.S., Inc. on October 30, 2015 for $750,000 cash. Canamex also assumed the obligations of the Company to Patriot Gold under the option Agreement. The sale to Canamex was subject to the Company’s 1.5% net smelter return (NSR) royalty as well as an underlying royalty of 2.0% to the original project vendor. 
 
Golden Eagle Placers Mine
 
(1) Location: The Golden Eagle Placers mine is located in township 35 north, range 34 east, and encompasses the entire section 29. The Golden Eagle mine is located 27.8 miles from the town of Winnemucca, Nevada off HYW 80/Jungo RD.
 (2) Description of claim: The Golden Eagle mine consists of 704 acres of patented (fee simple). The annual tax on this property is $146. The property was purchased by American International Ventures, Inc. subsequent to the reverse acquisition of Placer Gold Prospecting, Inc. for $601,000.00 in cash, note, and Company shares. The Company used approximately $68,000 of the Bruner sale proceeds to close its acquisition of Golden Eagle.
 (3) History of Previous Operations: The Golden Eagle mine was previously worked back in the 1930's by a large group of miners. The site has an extensive amount of shafts, adits, and tailings that were left by the early group of miners that were in search of gold. 
 (4) (i) The Golden Eagle mine is an open cast surface deposit with additional subsurface workings. Our company retained the services of Aurum Exploration, and AMEC during the acquisition of this property to obtain all necessary permits and conduct geological evaluations. AMEC is currently working on obtaining all permits for mining and roadways with the assistance of Aurum Exploration. Over $250,000

has been spent on the construction of roads leading to the mine, and excavation of two settling ponds. At this time the property is without known reserves and the proposed program is exploratory in nature.
  (ii) The Golden Eagle mine has a 2 bedroom house and office, well, gates, and water truck at the site. 
 5) Gold mineralization is thought to have occurred during periods of fracture and breccia controlled chalcedony sulfide mineralization. Oxidation appears to be related to a deep, wide spread acid leaching event, and by descending supergene fluids along the East Fault. The Vortex Zone, bordering the south end of the Brimstone Zone, is hosted in rocks similar to those at Brimstone, but overprinted with extensive hydrothermal brecciation. Alteration in the Vortex Zone is primarily strong silicification capped with hydrothermal argillic and subordinate acid leach alteration. Mineralization in the Vortex Zone is thought to be related to several pulses of fracturing and hydrothermal brecciation, plus quartz and chalcedonic veining. Vortex is bounded on the east by the East Fault, and is open to the north, west, and south and at depth. Subsequent Acquisition of Claims in Baja California, Mexico.
 
In January 2013, the Company leased certain claims from the mother of the current President of the Company’s Mexican subsidiary which covers 22.5 acres, in Baja California, Mexico for a period of five (5) years.

Description of our Current Business
 
Since the acquisition of PGPI, our operations have focused on planning, developing and operating past producing precious metal properties and mines. Specifically, we are now a gold and silver exploration and extraction company, operating primarily in the Baja California through our subsidiary AIVN de Mexico. In addition to our mining claims in Nevada, we also lease certain mining claims in the Baja California, Mexico. The main focus of current activity has been on mining claims in Baja California, Mexico. During June 2013, we commenced limited operations on the mining claims known as the Mother Lode which we acquired in early calendar year 2013. These claims have both placer and hard rock geological characteristics, and we began a pilot program to mine the placer portion of the claim in June 2013. A problem with our mining permit caused us to suspend mining in May 2014. We are addressing this problem and expect to resume mining before the end of our third fiscal quarter 2016. We mine the placer material using heavy equipment and then process the material through a wash mill located on the premises. We purchased a majority of the necessary heavy equipment and mill in 2012. We have not established any proven or probable reserves on this property. On February 20, 2018 the Company acquired as a wholly owned subsidiary GeoEnergy (USA) Inc., GeoAsia Group, GeoFuel (Singapore) PTE LTD, Geo-Qtx Synfuels, Inc International License agreement and Indonesia Joint Venture with PT Bhumi Sriwijaya Perdana Coal for eighty million shares.

We currently have one full time employee located in Mexico, and five-part time employees in the United States consisting of our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Technology Officer.
 
Types of Claims
 
* a patented mining claim is a mineral claim originally staked on land owned by in the United States Government, where all its associated mineral rights have been secured by the claimant from the U.S. Government in compliance with the laws and procedures relating to such claims, and title to the surface of the claim and the minerals beneath the surface have been transferred from the U.S. Government to the claimant. Annual mining claim assessment work is not required, and the claim is taxable real estate.
 
* an unpatented mining claim is a mineral claim staked on federal, state or, in the case of severed mineral rights, private land to which a deed from the U.S. Government or other mineral title owner has not been received by the claimant. Unpatented claims give the claimant the exclusive right to explore for and to develop the underlying minerals and use the surface for such purpose. However, the claimant does not own title to either the minerals or the surface, and the claim is subject to annual assessment work requirements and the payment of annual rental fees which are established by the governing authority of the land on which the claim is located. The claim may or may not be subject to production royalties payable to that governing authority.
 
Exploration Business and Operations
 The Company doesn’t expect to conduct any mining operations in Nevada during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018 and there can be no assurance the Company will be able to sell or have the financing to complete the permitting of the Golden Eagle or ever mine in Nevada. 
 We have accumulated substantial losses and our auditor has issued to us a going concern opinion. We expect to continue to incur losses unless and until we generate sufficient revenue from production to fund continuing operations including exploration and development costs. We expect such losses or the monthly burn rate to be in the range of $40,000 to $60,000. There is no assurance we will be profitable for any quarterly or annual period. We anticipate we will need to raise approximately $5,000,000 to $7,000,000 in the next 12 months to fund our planned exploration expenditures, debt service and general working capital requirements. We plan to raise the financing through debt and/or equity placements. Failure to raise needed financing could result in us having to scale back or discontinue exploration activities or some or all of our business operations.

Our Industry
 
The Gold Market. The market for gold is large, liquid and global. Gold continues to see demand in the jewelry, industrial and health science industries; however, gold’s main demand comes in the form of safe haven investment. From economic, political and social uncertainty to a hedge against inflation, gold is, and has long been, considered by many a commodity of refuge from concerns with fiat currencies and their corresponding economies.
 
The World Gold Council (“WGC”), a leading international gold industry research organization, published on its website that total gold demand for the fourth quarter of 2011 rose 21% to 1,017 metric tonnes (a metric tonne is equal to 2,204.6 pounds) year-on-year. Of this increase, investment demand posted the largest segment increase, more than offsetting the decline in gold jewelry demand. Due to the volatility of the price of gold, however, there is no guarantee that total gold demand will continue to grow at comparable rates in the future.
 
The Silver Market. Unlike the gold market, demand within the silver market has been predominantly for fabrication – mainly industrial application, photography and jewelry – with investment making up only a small portion of total yearly demand.
 Government and Environmental Regulation
 
Our mining, processing operations and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing: (i) the protection of the environment, (ii) exploration, (iii) mine safety, development and production, (iv) exports,(v) taxes, (vi) labor standards, (vii) occupational health, (viii) waste disposal, (ix) toxic substances, (x) water rights, (xi) explosives and (xii) other matters. New laws and regulations, amendments to existing laws and regulations or more stringent implementation of existing laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on us, increase costs, cause a reduction in levels of, or suspension of, production and/or delay or prevent the development of new mining properties.
 
The governmental agencies and regulators tasked with implementing and enforcing the above laws and regulations include the Bureau of Land Management, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
 
We believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Such compliance requires significant expenditures and increases mine development and operating costs. Mining is subject to potential risks and liabilities associated with pollution of the environment and the disposal of waste products occurring as a result of mineral exploration and production. Environmental liability may result from mining activities conducted by others prior to our ownership of a property. To the extent we are subject to uninsured environmental liabilities, the payment of such liabilities would reduce our otherwise available earnings and could have a material adverse effect on our business plan.
 
Licenses and Permits
 
Our operations require licenses and permits from various governmental authorities. We believe we hold all material licenses and permits required under applicable laws and regulations and believe we are presently complying in all material respects with the terms of such licenses and permits. However, such licenses and permits are subject to change in various circumstances. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain all necessary licenses and permits that may be required to explore and develop our properties, commence construction or operation of mining facilities and properties under exploration or development or to maintain continued operations that economically justify the cost.

11

Mine Safety and Health Administration Regulations
 
Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are required to disclose in their periodic reports filed with the SEC information regarding specified health and safety violations, orders and citations, related assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities. At the present time we do not plan any operations in 2018/19 in Nevada.
Competition
 
Because the life of a mine is limited by its mineral reserves, we are continually seeking to replace and expand our reserves through the exploration of existing properties as well as through acquisitions of interests in new properties or of interests in companies which own such properties. We encounter competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties and with the engaging and maintaining of qualified industry experienced personnel. This competition may increase the cost of acquiring suitable properties and retaining qualified industry experienced personnel.
The Share Exchange
 
On March 23, 2012, we (as buyer) entered into, and closed on, a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with the shareholders of Placer Gold Prospecting, Inc. (“PGPI”), a Florida corporation, pursuant to which we acquired all 162,350,000 outstanding shares of common stock of PGPI in exchange for 162,350,000 shares of our common stock (the “Share Exchange”). Immediately prior to the Exchange Agreement, we had 19,354,044 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.
 The transaction has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, a procedure that treats the transaction as though PGPI had acquired AIVN. Under the accounting for a reverse recapitalization, the assets and liabilities of AIVN were recorded on the books of the continuing company, and the stockholders' equity accounts of AIVN were reorganized to reflect the terms of the Share Exchange. No goodwill or other intangible asset was recognized. 
 
After closing of the Share Exchange, the former shareholders of PGPI now own approximately 89% of our common stock and we own 100% of PGPI. PGPI is in the business of mining exploration and acquisition. 
 
Jack Wagenti, our CEO, at that time, executed the Exchange Agreement on our behalf. Mr. Wagenti was a founder, CEO and director of PGPI, and owned 25 million shares of common stock of PGPI (approx. 16%) at the time of the closing of the Share Exchange (the “Closing”). Frederick Dunne, Jr., one of our directors as of Closing, owned 1,000,000 shares of common stock of PGPI (less than 1%) as of the closing. Arthur Ackerman, one of our directors as of closing, owned 6,000,000 shares of common stock of PGPI (approximately 3.6%) as of the closing.
 
 After giving effect to the Share Exchange, there were 181,695,044 shares of our common stock outstanding, of which approximately 89% are held by the former shareholders of PGPI. Prior to the Share Exchange, we were a shell company with no business operations. As a result of the Share Exchange, we are no longer considered a shell company and there was a change in control of the Company.
 
The issuance of the shares of our common stock pursuant to the Share Exchange, was made in reliance upon an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to Regulation D promulgated thereunder. As such, the shares of our common stock may not be offered or sold unless they are registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available.
