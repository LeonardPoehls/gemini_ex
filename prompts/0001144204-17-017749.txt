Item 1.     Business
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated in August 2015 as a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
Objective and Business Opportunity
 
We have and will continue to focus our efforts on seeking and consummating an initial business combination with a company that has an enterprise value of between $350 million and $750 million, although a target entity with a smaller or larger enterprise value may be considered. While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business industry or sector and in any geographic region, we expect to focus on businesses based in North America that engage primarily in the financial services, healthcare services and industrials sectors because we believe that this best combines the expertise and experience of our combined team with sectors that offer attractive investment opportunities.
 
It is our philosophy that capital has become increasingly commoditized and that successful investment results will come not from having capital alone, but rather from having the ability to accurately assess businesses with complex strategic, management and operational issues and the added expertise to deal with these issues in increasingly competitive and changing environments. We believe this to be particularly true during times of economic uncertainty, dislocations in capital markets and other conditions that create a challenge for businesses, and opportunities for investors with the right management team. In recognition of this, we have assembled a team of executives, directors and other advisors who blend traditional investment and acquisition expertise, management and operational expertise, and deep experience in financial, strategic and operational restructurings. We are confident that this team is capable of creating value in businesses that we acquire.
 
We believe that the broad experience and expertise of our combined team enable us to explore a wide range of potential acquisition targets. We target companies with strong business fundamentals and those which are in need of operational improvement and can thereby benefit from our human and financial capital. The members of our combined team have proven experience and track records in identifying, acquiring and improving businesses that have strong underlying fundamentals, but are undervalued due to company-specific issues, industry dislocation, limited access to capital, or other exogenous factors that are fundamentally temporary in nature. Our combined team has played meaningful roles in contrarian investment situations with businesses requiring significant changes in strategy, enhancement of management or operational improvement, using our expertise in those areas to improve the businesses and drive ongoing growth.
 
We believe that the experience, capabilities and track record of our combined team will make us an attractive partner for potential target businesses, enhance our ability to complete a successful business combination and, thereafter, improve the performance of the business in order to create value for investors.
 
Our management team is led by Mohsin Meghji. Mr. Meghji serves as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Meghji is the Managing Partner of M-III Partners and is a nationally recognized U.S. turnaround professional with a track record of building value across a wide range of sectors, including financial services, healthcare services and industrials. M-III Partners is a merchant banking, investment and restructuring advisory firm founded by Mr. Meghji whose philosophy and approach marries management and operations with financial expertise in order to enhance performance and create value. Mr. Meghji has over 25 years of advisory and management experience in building value in companies that are undergoing financial, operational or strategic transitions. He has accomplished this through both operating management and financial advisory roles, often in partnership with some of the world’s leading financial institutions, private equity firms and hedge fund investors.
 
Mr. Meghji has led the repositioning of, and driven value creation at, numerous businesses over the past two decades in an operating management or financial advisory capacity. Mr. Meghji’s most recent corporate management role was at Springleaf Holdings, LLC, a subprime consumer finance company (now known as OneMain Holdings, Inc.), where he served as Executive Vice President and Head of Strategy and as Chief Executive Officer of its captive insurance companies, Merit Life Insurance Co. and Yosemite Insurance Company. These insurance companies provided life, property and casualty insurance coverage to Springleaf’s customers. Springleaf was created in late-2010 when American International Group, Inc. sold 80% of its subsidiary, American General Finance Inc., to affiliates of Fortress Investment Group LLC. At the time of the sale, American General Finance Inc. provided consumer loans, retail financing and mortgages to more than one million families through more than 1,100 branches located across the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the United Kingdom. After multiple years of operating losses, Springleaf turned profitable in 2013 as a result of the strategic, management and operational improvements implemented by its new ownership and management team, evidencing a significant turnaround in its performance. Springleaf went public (NYSE: LEAF) in October 2013 at a $1.95 billion valuation. As part of its senior management team and Head of Strategy for the company, Mr. Meghji played a key role in this successful transition.

Over the course of his career, Mr. Meghji, along with several of his colleagues at M-III Partners, has driven improvements in performance for numerous companies experiencing challenges. The following represents a sample of such cases:
 

· | Mariner Health Care, Inc., one of the largest nursing home operators in the United States, with more than 400 locations containing more than 49,000 beds at the time of its bankruptcy filing. Mr. Meghji was retained in 1999 as turnaround advisor to the various private equity funds who controlled Mariner following its bankruptcy. During his tenure at Mariner, he worked with the investor group to develop the turnaround business plan, hired a new management team and served on the Board of Directors from 2002 – 2004. The business plan included significant overhead and cost reductions, facility rationalization and a significant investment in IT improvements. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Covanta Energy Corp., a national provider of waste management and energy generation services to municipal entities. Mr. Meghji was retained as Chief Restructuring Advisor to assist Covanta in the development of a business plan while restructuring through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. While at Covanta, Mr. Meghji spearheaded a restructuring of the company’s operations through divestiture of non-core operations, increasing focus on the core “waste-to-energy” business, rationalizing the overall cost structure and enhancing the management team. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Masonite International Inc., one of the largest door manufacturers in the world. Mr. Meghji and Thomas Persteiner, who will serve as one of our operating advisors, were initially retained in 2008 as financial advisors to debtholders who had taken control of Masonite during a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. At Masonite, Messrs. Meghji and Persteiner worked with a new management team to develop a turnaround business plan and manufacturing strategy. This business plan required significant overhead and other cost reductions in order to counter a massive decline in sales due to the global financial crisis. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Capmark Financial Group Inc., a leading commercial real estate finance company with businesses in commercial real estate lending and mortgage banking, investment and funds management, and servicing in North America, Asia and Europe. Capmark was the successor to GMAC’s Commercial Mortgage Business which was purchased by affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., Goldman Sachs and others in March 2006. Mr. Meghji was retained as Chief Restructuring Officer in 2009 and worked with Capmark’s management team to restructure the business through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding which culminated in 2011. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In each of these cases and others, Mr. Meghji and his team successfully identified the value within the business, designed and implemented a business plan which maximized this value and enabled shareholders to realize this value. We caution that the historical results reflected above are not indicative of future results and no assurance can be given as to whether future transactions will achieve similar results.
 
Mr. Meghji’s management and restructuring expertise is supplemented by the investment expertise of Suleman E. Lunat, a Partner at M-III Partners who serves as our Executive Vice President and Head of Corporate Development, and other investment professionals from M-III Partners. Mr. Lunat is an accomplished investment professional with extensive experience in sourcing equity and debt investment opportunities at Apollo Global Management and other investment firms. Before joining Apollo, Mr. Lunat served as a member of the founding team of Greenhill Capital Partners LLC (now known as GCP Partners), the private equity business of Greenhill & Co., Inc. With support from our broader team, he has primary responsibility for evaluating the merit of investment opportunities.
 
Mr. Lunat has 20 years of experience as an investor in public and private equity, credit and distressed special situations and investment banking. Over this period, he has developed investment experience over a broad range of industries. Mr. Lunat has provided M&A, debt restructuring and capital raising services to a range of middle market and large corporate clients in North America and Europe. He also has developed experience as a principal investor in private equity and credit and distressed special situations. We believe that this experience has provided Mr. Lunat with an inter-disciplinary approach to investment analysis, as well as a deep understanding of capital structures. Additionally, we believe that the contacts developed by Mr. Lunat over the course of his career can be helpful in identifying and making introductions to potential acquisition candidates. Mr. Lunat’s analytical skills have led him to a track record of successful investment results, including as an investor in both Capmark and Springleaf.
 
In addition to leveraging the contacts and relationships held by our combined team to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we also benefit from the long-standing relationships held by the management, directors, operating advisors and other advisors of M-III Partners with owners of private and public companies, private equity funds, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and business brokers. Certain key members of the M-III Partners team are active members of our combined team and the remainder of the professionals of M-III Partners are available to us to provide specific expertise on an as-needed basis. M-III Partners receives a regular stream of investment opportunities in the ordinary course of its business and these opportunities are made available to us prior to their review by M-III Partners for its own account.

Acquisition and Business Strategy
 
Target Industries of Focus
 
We focus primarily on identifying attractive acquisition candidates in the financial services, healthcare services and industrial sectors based in North America, but our search for business combination targets may extend across the wider range of industry sectors and geographies in which we believe that we can create shareholder value. We believe that our investment and operating expertise across multiple industry verticals will give us a large, addressable universe of potential targets in order to enable us to maximize our chances of completing a business combination in a timely manner and to maximize shareholder returns following such acquisition.
 
We have elected to focus our search for an initial business combination target on financial services, healthcare services and industrials because multiple members of our combined team have extensive experience and a successful track record of investment and management within those sectors. We believe that each of these three industries is currently experiencing some element of change or dislocation that is having a broad impact on businesses within the industry. Those businesses which have the capital and expertise to respond well will obtain a competitive advantage that should drive a disproportionate increase in shareholder value. We believe that this creates a significant opportunity for us to apply our human and financial capital to our initial acquisition target in order to capture this disproportionate increase in value for our shareholders.
 
Our experience and the broad rationale for our interest with respect to each of these three primary sectors for investment focus is as follows:
 
➤ Financial Services.
 
The financial services sector is a primary area of focus due to a combination of our combined team’s depth of experience in this industry and the opportunity that we perceive from the rapid change that is transforming the industry. Driven primarily by the after-effects of the global financial crisis, the recent imposition of the Dodd-Frank regulatory regime, potential regulatory changes under the Trump administration, as well as other regulatory and market events, financial services firms are being forced to reconsider their core strategies. We would expect that this change would be accelerated in an environment characterized by economic uncertainty, instability in capital markets and uncertain regulatory regimes. In many cases, large diversified financial services companies are being forced to retrench and, as a result, are curtailing services and exiting business lines. These secular changes have created an opportunity for non-regulated entities to fill the void created by the large diversified financial services companies and play a more important role in providing services such as lending, specialty finance, insurance and asset management. Concurrently, many smaller financial services firms are being forced to raise capital in order to satisfy regulatory requirements, finance necessary investment or exploit available growth opportunities. This trend may be reversed if proposed regulatory initiatives are implemented.
 
In addition to regulatory changes, the financial services industry is also being transformed by technological changes. Currently, new technologies are driving the conversion of traditional, relationship-driven market segments into online solutions, as, for example, traditional money managers are seeing increasing competition from online management products and traditional consumer lenders are seeing increased competition from online lenders and loan brokers. Similarly, in areas such as payment processing and credit cards, long-established market leaders are facing new competition that is more convenient, secure and cost-effective than the traditional solutions. The changes wrought by these new technologies are forcing established companies to re-think their business models and strategies. Many of these companies have a sustainable business, but are challenged by identifying their key competitive strengths in this new environment or obtaining the capital needed to adapt.
 
We believe that regulatory and technological change will continue to drive industry dislocation for the foreseeable future, despite growing demand for financial services. We believe that this creates opportunity for an investment team with deep expertise in the financial services industry, such as us, to create value.
 
Members of our combined team have extensive experience in a wide variety of sectors in the financial services industry, having been involved in a variety of capacities in companies such as Springleaf, Capmark, Berkadia Commercial Mortgage, Hunt Mortgage Group, American International Group, John Hancock Financial Services, MacKay Shields, LLC and Pioneer Investments USA. We also believe that we have access to a deep roster of professional contacts in the industry, resulting from decades of our combined team’s analysis, investment and restructuring of companies within these sectors. These include senior executives of private equity firms, commercial banks, investment banks, finance companies, insurance companies and asset managers. We believe that our relationships with these senior executives will provide us with access to investment opportunities from which we can seek an appropriate business combination target.

➤ Healthcare Services.
 
We believe that the healthcare services industry will provide attractive acquisition opportunities because it is experiencing rapid transformation and strong secular tailwinds. Factors such as demographic change, technological change and the rising incidence of chronic disease will, we believe, drive increasing demand for various healthcare and healthcare-related services. For example:

· | the US Department of Health and Human Services reported in February 2017 that the number of Americans under 65 years of age who do not have health insurance has dropped by approximately 20 million between 2010 and 2015; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | in its Health, United States, 2015 report, the Centers for Disease Control reported that the average life expectancy in the United States increased from 76.8 years in 2000 to 78.8 years in 2014; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Administration for Community Living of the US Department of Health and Human Services reports that the number of Americans who are 65 or older is projected to increase from 40.2 million in 2010 to 54.8 million in 2020 and then to 72.0 million by 2030. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Although the aging population and rising incidence of chronic disease drive demand for increased healthcare services, this increased demand is offset by a global focus on reducing the cost of healthcare delivery and payment based upon successful outcomes (rather than volume or cost). Potential regulatory changes may also offset this rising demand.

Concurrently with this increase in demand for healthcare services and changes in delivery and reimbursement models, the healthcare services industry is also being transformed by technological change. These changes include advances in both hardware and software that can provide more effective and efficient delivery of healthcare services. Notably, the introduction of online medical records and network-enabled diagnostic equipment has created the ability to collect large quantities of real-time patient data. Similarly, improved data analysis technologies are enabling both providers and consumers of healthcare services to identify the factors that produce the most positive outcomes in order to develop the most cost-effective solutions.
 
These changes are forcing businesses in the healthcare services sector to adapt to new conditions. Some of these businesses are successfully navigating these changes with internal resources, but many others require additional financing or management expertise to address this rapidly changing business environment. These changes have triggered a wave of merger and acquisition activity within the industry, as companies seek acquisitions to achieve scale or obtain technologies that are perceived as necessary to thrive in this new environment, while simultaneously divesting non-core assets in order to preserve high growth rates in a cost-sensitive environment.
 
Members of our combined team have significant management experience in the healthcare services sector, having been involved in a variety of capacities in companies such as HealthSouth Corporation, Mariner, Interim HealthCare, Medical Staffing Network, Gyrus ACMI, Tender Loving Care Home Health Care, American HomePatient and Rotech. From this experience, we understand the regulatory and insurance reimbursement complexities that are inherent in managing healthcare services companies, as well as the unique challenges of managing multi-locational healthcare businesses. While the regulatory and reimbursement regime can be complex and may deter many investors, a knowledgeable management team, such as ours, can navigate those complexities in order to drive growth.
 
We believe that the healthcare services sector offers to us a large pool of potential acquisition candidates and that our extensive range of contacts within the industry will provide us with access to a stream of potential investment opportunities. When coupled with our specialized expertise in this sector, we believe that we will possess a competitive advantage as we source and act upon investment opportunities in the sector.
 
➤ Industrials.
 
We believe that industrial companies today are facing a changing operating environment that is having a significant impact on profitability. Changes in market demand, end-buyer preferences, technology, regulation, currency, input costs and manufacturing costs are ongoing. These changes can have a significant impact on the size and growth rate of various market segments and on the competitive position of the assets and business models that serve them. Moreover, the effect of these changes on many industrial companies has been magnified by the forces of globalization and by continuing global economic instability.
 
The industrial dynamics described above create both opportunities and threats, including (i) end markets can grow or shrink, (ii) capacity can be long or short and (iii) a given asset type or business model can become advantaged or not. Under any of these circumstances, management teams may or may not accurately diagnose how best to respond. This constant interplay between the changing environment and individual companies’ evolving strategies creates the potential for situations in which assets are mispriced relative to their potential. This is particularly true in the middle market where many industrial companies lack the resources to navigate this complex business environment.
 
We believe that all of these changes are driving the need for adjustments to strategy, operations and capital structure that create opportunity for us to acquire an industrial company and enhance its value. Whether the challenge arises from globalization, technology or other causes, we believe that the changing environment for industrial companies has made management skill a significant competitive advantage for an industrial company. Those industrial companies that have strong management and sufficient financial resources will become industry leaders, while those who are unable to recognize or adapt to the changing environment will fall behind.

We have assembled a team of executives, directors, operating advisors and others who have a broad range of experience, enabling us to provide the financial and management resources necessary for an industrial company to thrive in today’s competitive environment. Members of our combined team have successfully transformed industrial companies in multiple industry segments by re-designing strategy, enhancing management capabilities and improving operations. They have been involved in a variety of capacities in companies such as GKN plc, Johnson Controls, Volvo Truck, GE Aerospace, Electrical Components International, Standard Pacific Corporation and Champion Home Builders. Members of our combined team have successfully transformed struggling industrial companies in multiple industry segments by re-designing strategy, enhancing management capabilities and improving operations. In the course of these efforts, they have created substantial value. We believe that our team will provide us with skilled resources to source, analyze, negotiate and close an attractive initial business combination, as well as to provide us with additional expertise and insights as we work to maximize value of the companies that we acquire.
 
Acquisition Criteria
 
Our management team is committed to efficiently and effectively identifying and conducting due diligence on appropriate acquisition targets in order to maximize our opportunity to consummate a business combination. Based upon the experience of our combined team, we have identified a variety of criteria and guidelines that we expect to apply when evaluating any potential acquisition. These include:

Ø | Underlying Fundamentals of the Target Business. The factors that we will evaluate in determining whether the underlying fundamentals of a target business meet our anticipated criteria include: Its financial condition and historical results of operation; our expectations of projected performance; the industry in which it operates; its brand recognition and potential; the experience and skill of existing management and availability of additional personnel; any additional capital requirements; its competitive position; any barriers to entry for potential competitors in the relevant industry; the stage of development of its key existing and potential products, processes or services; existing distribution channels for its products and potential for expansion; the degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services; any proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas; and industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which the business participates. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | External Factors Affecting the Target Business. The external factors affecting the target business that we anticipate we will evaluate include: The impact of regulation on the business; the regulatory environment of the industry; and the specific competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Anticipated Contribution that our Combined Team can Make to Growth of the Business. The factors that we will evaluate in determining the anticipated contribution that our combined team can make to the growth of the target business include: The scope of experience and skills possessed by our combined team in the relevant business and industry; the need for additional capital or management support required by the target business; and the value of our expertise in strategy, management and operations to the business. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Opportunity for Superior Investment Return. The factors that we will evaluate in determining whether we are likely to obtain a superior return on our investment in the business include: the valuation at which our investment is made; the appropriateness of the business for public capital markets; the potential for growth from add-on acquisitions; the potential for profitable, organic long-term growth; and the costs associated with effecting the business combination. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We anticipate that we will find the greatest number of opportunities for our initial business combination among middle market companies with aggregate enterprise value of approximately $350 million to $750 million, as determined in the sole discretion of our officers and directors according to reasonably accepted valuation standards and methodologies.
 
We believe that our investment results will be strongest when our expertise and resources can meaningfully contribute to the management and growth of the acquired business. This includes situations such as:
 

Ø | Strategic or Operational Improvements. Our combined team has significant and successful experience in investing in, and working with, companies where there is an opportunity to effect meaningful operational improvements or derive meaningful benefit from a change in strategy. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Members of our combined team have worked with such companies as investors, senior management, board members and consultants. We intend to tailor our approach to working with the target company’s management team to address the unique challenges and opportunities they face. Our combined team has the versatility and flexibility to allow us to provide strategic guidance as board members or to take on direct senior leadership roles to design and implement operational improvements or strategic change at the target company. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Value-Added Capital for Growth and/or Consolidation Opportunities. Over decades of combined investment experience, our combined team has developed significant expertise in successfully identifying and investing in companies that are achieving rapid and profitable organic growth and growth through strategic initiatives. Our combined team also has a long and successful track record in managing businesses of this nature. Through this experience, we have found that management teams vary in their ability to recognize growth opportunities and take advantage of them. It is our current intent to target companies whose management teams recognize the opportunities in their industry, but lack the capital to take advantage of those opportunities or could benefit from our combined team’s years of business experience in order to most effectively take advantage of those opportunities. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Established Companies in an Industry Experiencing Dislocation. We may seek to acquire an established company operating in an industry undergoing dislocation. Industries typically experience dislocation when faced with, among other things, supply and demand imbalances, new technology entrants, cyclicality and legal or regulatory challenges. We view episodes of industry dislocation as opportunities to acquire a company at an attractive multiple and invest in strengthening the long-term market position of the company over its competitors. The history of our combined team in successfully managing companies during periods of dislocation makes this a criteria that we will particularly seek as we identify appropriate business combination targets. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-


Ø | Complex or Out-of-Favor Businesses. Our management team believes that businesses that have situational complexity or operate in industries that have fallen out-of-favor with investors can provide attractive investment opportunities. Within a business, situational complexity can often arise from business, legal, regulatory or capital structure issues. Our combined team has a successful record of managing investments and operating improvements in complex or out-of-favor businesses by applying tailored solutions that drive value creation. Recognizing that capital today is becoming commoditized, we believe that it is the management skills of our combined team and our experience in managing complex situations that provide us with our greatest strategic advantage. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Ownership Transition Transaction. In our experience, acquisition opportunities for good businesses periodically arise when the external needs of the current owner restrict further investment in the business. These restrictions can arise from changing corporate priorities, financial distress within the owner, contractual divestiture requirements applicable to private equity funds, or other factors. In situations of this nature, it is not unusual for the seller to seek to retain a meaningful stake in the business in order to preserve the opportunity for further appreciation. We expect to actively seek out opportunities to acquire businesses of this nature in which we believe that the underlying business fundamentals justify the investment cost and provide a strong opportunity to achieve superior investment returns. Moreover, we believe that our close relationships with private equity firms will provide us with access to investment opportunities of this nature. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Deleveraging Transaction. Our combined team’s extensive relationships with lenders and private equity firms, as well as their prior experience in making deleveraging investments, should position us well to source and execute a recapitalizing acquisition. We believe that the record issuance of high yield debt and leveraged loans from 2011 through the first half of 2015 will lead to an increase in companies that will need to de-lever within the next two years. As opposed to distressed debt funds and investors, we believe we would be a preferred refinancing/de-leveraging solution to owners and management teams of middle-market companies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | “Partnership” Sale. We may seek to acquire one or more companies from a current owner, private equity or otherwise, who would like to retain a meaningful stake in the company to preserve and enhance potential upside. As a source of public equity capital, we believe that we will be well-positioned to provide liquidity to such an owner and expect that potential acquisition targets and partners would view the contribution to be made by our combined team as a positive factor in reviewing any acquisition proposal from us. We also could be an attractive financial and operating partner for a private equity firm that sees compelling acquisition opportunities, but may be already fully-invested. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The criteria and situations described above are not intended to be exhaustive and our evaluation of any particular initial business combination may reflect other considerations, factors and criteria deemed relevant by our management in effecting the relevant transaction, consistent with our business objective and strategy. Additionally, our management team may prioritize the importance of those factors differently when evaluating different target businesses, based upon our experiences with investments and acquisitions in the relevant industry.
 
Acquisition Process
 
In implementing the strategy described above, we have undertaken a disciplined approach to identifying, analyzing, negotiating, documenting and consummating any business combination and have developed investment policies and procedures that are intended to allow us to respond quickly to opportunities, while preserving the quality of our investment approval process.
Sourcing of Potential Acquisition Targets
 
Each member of our combined team is tasked with the responsibility for identifying and introducing to us potential business combination targets in order to provide a steady flow of investment opportunities. Our combined team are all highly experienced in their fields and have been selected with the goal of ensuring that we have the contacts and expertise needed to source our initial business combination target and add-on acquisitions. Each of them has developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships and has committed to using those contacts and relationships to assist us in sourcing investment opportunities.
 
Our combined team has developed its network of contacts and relationships though personal experience in sourcing, acquiring, operating, developing, growing, financing and selling businesses, as well as executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. Members of our combined team have served as executive officers or directors of financial services, healthcare services and industrial companies such as Bluestem Group Inc. (formerly known as Capmark Financial Group Inc.), Mariner Health Care Inc., iStar Financial Inc., Champion Home Builders, Springleaf Financial, John Hancock Financial Services, Ormet Corporation and Standard Pacific Corp. Through the professional experiences of our combined team, we have access to senior management of companies in our target industries (i.e., financial services, healthcare services and industrials) and others, as well as to executives and senior leaders of commercial banks, investment banks, private equity funds and hedge funds, who either hold business combination targets within their portfolios or otherwise can introduce us to valuable investment contacts. In addition, key members of our combined team have long-standing and strong relationships with senior players in the restructuring industry (such as financial advisors, distressed debt traders and investors, lenders, accounting firms, law firms and others).

--

 

We are confident that these networks of contacts and relationships are important sources of investment opportunities, both by making introductions to specific opportunities and by providing us with investment ideas and targets that we can investigate through our internal resources. We also anticipate that this network will provide our management team with introductions to opportunities which are proprietary or where a limited group of investors is invited to participate in the sale process.
 
Investment Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough and extensive due diligence review, which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews and inspection of facilities, and review of financial and other information that is made available to us.
 
We believe that our combined team is uniquely qualified to conduct a thorough diligence examination and understand the risks and opportunities inherent in the business of a particular company. In addition to the substantial management and operating experience of our combined team, key members of our combined team have extensive expertise in managing businesses in a wide variety of industries through financial and operational restructurings. Though this experience, we have built an expertise in quickly and efficiently identifying the risks, inefficiencies and opportunities for a business. We have also developed expertise in identifying management strengths and weaknesses, so that we can provide support where appropriate and otherwise make difficult, but often essential, management changes.
 
Our combined team also is well-qualified to undertake the financial analysis necessary to determine whether a particular business is an attractive business combination candidate. Members of our combined team have a diverse professional backgrounds and qualifications, including experience as investment bankers, “buy-side” investment professionals and restructuring advisors. Our combined team possesses valuable professional credentials and certifications, including certified turnaround professionals, chartered accountants, CPA’s, MBA’s and law degrees.
 
Our experience has shown us that successful acquisition transactions result not just from thorough diligence and attractive deal terms, but also from intangible factors, such as personal relationships and trust. Our combined team is well-versed in the art and science of negotiating investment and acquisition transactions, having been involved in a wide variety of such transactions during their careers. We also have found that trust which is built with the business management team during the diligence and negotiation stages of a transaction often provide the glue that binds the team together and allows difficult decisions to be made more easily after the transaction closes. Through our professional experience, we have learned how to delicately balance the conflicting goals of obtaining the best transaction terms for our investors and maintaining a strong relationship with the seller and the business management team. We believe that this, when coupled with our management experience, allows us to act more quickly and effectively to make the changes needed to improve management and operational efficiency of a business and build value.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
NASDAQ rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, or a qualified independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a qualified independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 
Members of our management team may directly or indirectly own common stock and warrants following our initial public offering, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. For additional information regarding our executive officers’ and directors’ business affiliations, see “Management —  Directors and Executive Officers”.
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our executive officers will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.
 
Our executive officers have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination by July 12, 2018.
 
Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this process a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
 
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
 
Financial Position
 
With funds available for a business combination currently in the amount of $144,969,529 (including amounts held outside the trust account at December 31, 2016) assuming no redemptions and after payment of $6,000,000 of deferred underwriting fees, we offer a target business a variety of options. These include, among other things, creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.

Effecting our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, funding for the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
 
Origination and Sourcing of Target Business Opportunities
 
We believe our combined team’s extensive investment and transaction experience, along with relationships with intermediaries and companies, will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our combined team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has been developed over the course of over 25 years, in the case of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
 
We believe that the combined team’s network of existing contacts and relationships will be able to deliver a flow of potential platform and add-on acquisition opportunities which are proprietary or where a limited group of established, credentialed buyers have been invited to participate in the sale process. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will continue to be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, executive officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a qualified independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 
If any of our executive officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Certain of our executive officers currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.
 
We anticipate that target business candidates will also continue to be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, private investment funds and other intermediaries. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus relating to our initial public offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of our officers and directors.

Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination
 
NASDAQ rules provide that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or a qualified independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Subject to this requirement, our management has virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we are not permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test.
 
To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Lack of business diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:
 

➤ | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


➤ | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Limited ability to evaluate the target’s management team
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that the additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Stockholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination
 
We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.
 

Type of Transaction | Whether Stockholder Approval is Required
------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 

 
Under NASDAQ’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:
 

➤ | we issue common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


➤ | any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by NASDAQ rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding shares of common stock or voting power of 5% or more; or 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


➤ | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Permitted purchases of our securities
 
In the event we seek stockholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy which requires insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information and (ii) clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.
 
In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
 
The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 

15
--

 

Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against the business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
 
Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.
 
Redemption rights for public stockholders upon completion of our initial business combination
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be approximately $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us (and Cantor Fitzgerald has agreed as part of its unit purchase agreement), pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private placement shares and (except for Cantor Fitzgerald) any public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our business combination.
 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons.
 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

➤ | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


➤ | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon the public announcement of our business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to purchase will remain open for at least 20 business days in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets upon consummation of our initial business combination to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.
 

16
--

 

If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

➤ | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


➤ | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares, private placement shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination. Cantor Fitzgerald has not committed to vote any private placement shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, we would need only 5,515,001 of the 15,000,000 public shares outstanding (approximately 36.8%) sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of our initial business combination in order to have such transaction approved. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us (and Cantor Fitzgerald has agreed as part of its unit purchase agreement), pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private placement shares and (except for Cantor Fitzgerald) public shares in connection with the completion of a business combination.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets upon consummation of our initial business combination to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
 
Limitation on redemption upon completion of our initial business combination if we seek stockholder approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares”. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem more than 20% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination.
 
Tendering stock certificates in connection with redemption rights
 
We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. The proxy materials that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
 

17
--

 

There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $35.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholders meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our business combination.
 
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
 
If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until July 12, 2018.
 
Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination
 
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed that if we do not complete our initial business combination by July 12, 2018, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination by July 12, 2018.

Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us (and Cantor Fitzgerald has agreed as part of its unit purchase agreement), pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares and private placement shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by July 12, 2018. However, if our initial stockholders acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by July 12, 2018.
 
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by July 12, 2018, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets upon consummation of our initial business combination to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Prior to acquiring any securities from our initial stockholders, permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement with us agreeing to be bound by the same restriction.

We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $869,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account (as of December 31, 2016), although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $50,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
 
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, Mohsin Meghji, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has agreed that he will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then Mr. Meghji will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We cannot assure you, however, that Mr. Meghji would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and Mr. Meghji asserts that he is unable to satisfy his indemnification obligations or that he has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against Mr. Meghji to enforce his indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against Mr. Meghji to enforce his indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.00 per share.

We will seek to reduce the possibility that Mr. Meghji will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Mr. Meghji will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately $869,000 from the proceeds held outside the trust account (as of December 31, 2016) with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $50,000).
 
Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination by July 12, 2018 may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. Delaware law provides that if a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination by July 12, 2018, is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete our business combination by July 12, 2018, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following July 12, 2018, and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers and auditors) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account.
 
As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, Mohsin Meghji, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and less any per-share amounts distributed from our trust account to our public stockholders in the event we are unable to complete our business combination by July 12, 2018 and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Mr. Meghji will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.

If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our business combination by July 12, 2018 or if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.
 
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, we will provide public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private placement shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

➤ | prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


➤ | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets upon consummation of our initial business combination of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


➤ | if our initial business combination is not consummated by July 12, 2018, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


➤ | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may consummate our initial business combination only if approved by a majority of the shares of common stock voted by our stockholders at a duly held stockholders meeting.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we have encountered, and may continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

Employees
 
We currently have three executive officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that Mr. Meghji or any other members of our management will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process, but he has and will continue to devote a substantial portion of his professional time to our affairs.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
We registered our units, common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financing reporting standards, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or IFRS, that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP or IFRS, or that the potential target may be able to obtain a PCAOB-compliant audit. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
