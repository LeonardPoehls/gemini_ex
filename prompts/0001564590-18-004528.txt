Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company using our proprietary chemistry technology to create novel antibiotics for serious and life-threatening multidrug-resistant infections. We are developing our lead product candidate, eravacycline, a fully synthetic fluorocycline, as an intravenous, or IV antibiotic for use as a first-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of multidrug-resistant infections, including multidrug-resistant, or MDR, Gram-negative infections, such as those found in complicated intra-abdominal infections, or cIAI.  
 We conducted a global phase 3 clinical program for eravacycline called IGNITE (Investigating Gram-Negative Infections Treated with Eravacycline). 
 On July 25, 2017, we announced top-line data from our IGNITE4 trial, a global phase 3 randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter, prospective study assessing the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of twice-daily intravenous, or IV, eravacycline (1.0 mg/kg every 12 hours) compared with meropenem (1g every 8 hours) for the treatment of cIAI that we conducted in 500 patients. In the trial, eravacycline met the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority of clinical response at the test-of-cure, or TOC, visit, under the guidance set by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. Prior to IGNITE4, we conducted IGNITE1, a phase 3 clinical trial of twice daily IV eravacycline (1.0 mg/kg every 12 hours) compared with ertapenem (1.0g IV every 24 hours) for the treatment of cIAI. In IGNITE1, eravacycline met the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority of clinical response.  
 On January 2, 2018, we announced the submission of a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA for IV eravacycline for the treatment of cIAI. The NDA submission includes data from the IGNITE1 and IGNITE4 phase 3 clinical trials. In February 2018, the FDA notified us that it had completed its initial 60-day review of our NDA and August 28, 2018 was set as our Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date for the FDA’s completion of its review of our NDA. In the third quarter of 2017 we submitted a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the EMA for IV eravacycline for the treatment of cIAI primarily based upon the results of IGNITE1.
 The FDA has granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and Fast Track designations for IV eravacycline for cIAI. 
 In February 2018, we announced top-line data from
 our IGNITE3 trial, a global phase 3 randomized, multi-center, double-blind, clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of once-daily intravenous, or IV, eravacycline, at a dose of 1.5mg/kg every 24 hours, compared to ertapenem, at a dose of 1g every 24 hours, for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, or cUTI, that we conducted in 1,205 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive eravacycline or ertapenem for a minimum of 5 days, and then were eligible for transition to an appropriate approved oral agent. In this trial, eravacycline did not meet the co-primary endpoints of responder rate, a combination of clinical cure and microbiological success, in the microbiological intent-to-treat, or micro-ITT, population at the end-of-IV treatment visit and at the test-of-cure visit (5-10 days post therapy). Given the IGNITE3 results, we are no longer evaluating IV eravacycline for the treatment of cUTI and have also ceased development of an oral formulation for eravacycline for the treatment of cUTI.
 Eravacycline is designed to treat a broad range of infections, including infections due to multidrug-resistant bacteria. In in vitro experiments, eravacycline has demonstrated the ability to cover a wide variety of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative, Gram-positive, anaerobic and atypical bacteria, including multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter. Multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (or CREs) listed as an urgent threat and multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter is listed as a serious threat by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, in a September 2013 report and they are listed as Priority 1; Critical pathogens in the World Health Organization’s priority pathogens list for R&D, published in February 2017. CREs were a confirmed area of great concern by the World Health Organization in an April 2014 global surveillance report. Gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to multiple available antibiotics are increasingly common and a growing threat to public health. We believe that the ability of eravacycline to cover multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, as well as multidrug-resistant Gram-positive, anaerobic and atypical bacteria, will enable eravacycline to become the drug of choice for first-line empiric treatment of patients with cIAI.

In 2011 and 2012, the U.S. government awarded contracts for potential funding of over $100 million for the development of our antibiotic compounds, which today consist of eravacycline, TP-6076 and TP-271. These awards include a contract for up to $67.3 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for the development of eravacycline for the treatment of disease caused by bacterial biothreat pathogens. We refer to this contract as the BARDA Contract. The funding under the BARDA Contract was used for certain activities in the development of eravacycline to treat cIAI and, prior to the IGNITE3 results, cUTI. These awards also include a contract for up to $35.8 million from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, a division of the National Institutes of Health, for the development of TP-271. We refer to this contract as the NIAID Contract. In addition, during 2011, NIAID awarded a separate grant for $2.9 million. We refer to this award as the NIAID Grant. These awards were made to CUBRC, Inc., or CUBRC, an independent, not-for-profit, research corporation that specializes in U.S. government-based contracts, with which we are collaborating. CUBRC serves as the prime contractor under these awards, primarily carrying out a program management and administrative role with additional responsibility for the management of preclinical studies. We serve as lead technical expert on all aspects of these awards and also serve as a subcontractor of CUBRC responsible for management of chemistry, manufacturing and control activities and clinical studies. The BARDA Contract includes funding for some of the activities that we would otherwise have been required to fund on our own in connection with our NDA submission for eravacycline.
 In March 2017, the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator, or CARB-X, an international public-private partnership focused on advancing new antimicrobial products to address the threat of antibiotic resistance, selected us to receive up to $4.0 million in research funding over 18 months for TP-6076. In connection with this funding, we entered into a cost reimbursement Sub-Award Agreement with the Trustees of Boston University, the administrator of the program. We began recognizing revenue from the Sub-Award Agreement in April 2017. Although the Sub-Award Agreement has a term which currently expires on December 31, 2018, the project can be terminated for convenience at any time.  
 Strategy
 Our goal is to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes novel antibiotics, such as eravacycline, for use in areas of unmet medical need. Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Seek regulatory approval for IV eravacycline for the treatment of cIAI. We have completed two phase 3 clinical trials of IV eravacycline in patients with cIAI – IGNITE1 and IGNITE4. We submitted an NDA to the FDA for IV eravacycline for the treatment of cIAI based on the results of IGNITE1 and IGNITE4. We have also submitted an MAA to the EMA for IV eravacycline for the treatment of cIAI based on the results of IGNITE1. Both the NDA and the MAA are currently under review by the respective regulatory agencies. The PDUFA goal date is August 28, 2018 for the FDA to complete its review of our NDA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize the commercial potential of eravacycline for the treatment of cIAI. If eravacycline is approved for the treatment of cIAI, we intend to directly commercialize eravacycline in the United States with a targeted hospital sales force and to commercialize eravacycline in other regions through collaboration arrangements, such as the collaboration agreement we entered into with Everest Medicines Limited in February 2018. We believe that eravacycline’s potent coverage of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria and other multidrug-resistant bacteria, will allow it to be used to treat cIAI patients successfully in hospitals, Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF), and Long Term Acute Care Hospitals (LTACH).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue development of eravacycline in additional indications. We are developing eravacycline for the treatment of cIAI, and, subject to obtaining additional financing, intend to pursue development of eravacycline for the treatment of additional indications, including other serious and life-threatening infections. We may pursue these development activities either by ourselves or with collaborators
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Opportunistically advance development of other product candidates created using our proprietary chemistry technology. In addition to eravacycline, we are currently conducting phase 1 clinical trials of TP-271 and TP-6076. We intend to advance our antibiotic product pipeline with differentiated product candidates created using our proprietary chemistry technology and targeting hospital and acute care markets. We may pursue these activities either by ourselves or with collaborators.

Drug-Resistant Antibiotic Market
 Physicians commonly prescribe antibiotics to treat patients with acute and chronic infectious diseases that are either presumed or known to be caused by bacteria. Inappropriate use of antibiotics and lack of new therapies has resulted in a rapid increase in bacterial infections that are resistant to multiple antibacterial agents. Global microbial resistance, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, now results in the death of at least 700,000 people each year, according to an analysis commissioned by the U.K. government in 2016. The report predicts that failing to develop effective treatments for drug-resistant bacteria by 2050 would lead to 10 million extra 
 3


deaths a year. In a September 2013 report, the CDC estimated that every year in the United States, more than two million people acquire serious infections that are resistant to one or more of the antibiotics designed to treat those infections, with at least 23,000 dying as a result, and many more dying from other conditions that are complicated by the occurrence of an antibiotic-resistant infection. These antibiotic-resistant infections add considerable and avoidable costs to the U.S. healthcare system. In the same September 2013 report, the CDC noted that the total economic cost of antibiotic infections to the U.S. economy has been estimated to be as high as $20 billion in excess of direct healthcare costs. Over the last decade there has been an increase in antibiotics that target resistant Gram-positive bacteria, but there still remain limited therapeutic options for resistant Gram-negative infections. According to the CDC, among all of the bacterial resistance problems, Gram-negative pathogens are particularly worrisome because they are becoming resistant to nearly all drugs that would be considered for treatment, with the most serious Gram-negative infections being healthcare associated and the most common pathogens being Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter.
 Antibiotics that treat bacterial infections can be classified as broad-spectrum or narrow-spectrum. Antibiotics that are active against a mixture of Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria are referred to as broad-spectrum. Antibiotics that are active only against a select subset of bacteria are referred to as narrow-spectrum. Because it usually takes from 24 to 72 hours from the time a specimen is received in the laboratory to definitively diagnose a particular bacterial infection, physicians may be required to prescribe antibiotics for serious infections without having identified the bacteria. As such, effective first-line treatment of serious infections requires the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics with activity against a broad range of bacteria at least until the bacterial infection can be diagnosed. 
 Broad-spectrum antibiotics are used to treat major hospital infections such as cIAI, hospital-acquired pneumonia, or HAP, and ventilator-associated pneumonia, or VAP. Based on an analysis from a variety of industry sources, we estimate that the number of patients treated with antibiotics in the United States and European Union annually includes approximately 4.6 million cIAI patients with each patient being treated for an average of 8.6 days for a combined estimated 40 million annual average days of treatment; and 2.8 million HAP/VAP patients with each patient being treated for an average of 9.6 days for a combined estimated 27 million annual average days of treatment. Of these patients, we believe that approximately 40% of cIAI patients require a change in therapy and 50% of patients with cIAI are receiving combination therapy.
 As such, at present, there is an acute need for new drugs to treat multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Currently approved products, such as meropenem are becoming increasingly ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria due to increasing resistance, limiting patients’ treatment options, particularly for patients with multidrug-resistant infections. Few new therapeutic agents have been approved or are in clinical development.
 A survey of infectious disease specialists published in the June 2012 edition of Clinical Infectious Disease rated multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections as the most important unmet clinical need in current practice. In the survey, 63% of physicians reported treating a patient in the past year whose bacterial infection was resistant to all available antibacterial agents. A nationwide electronic database looked at the prevalence of gram negative resistance from 2008-2015 in US Hospitals and it showed MDR rates continue to increase. Out of the 3,158,349 isolates tested 5.3% were considered MDR pathogens. Five bacteria accounted for 92.7% of all MDR isolates:  E coli (39.4%), P aeruginosa (29.4%), K pneumoniae (13.2%), A baumannii (5.4%) and Enterobacter spp (5.2%). The highest rate of MDR was associated with the hospital onset setting (11.4%), followed by the admission period (6.6%), and the ambulatory setting (3.5%). The database showed that 42.9% of A baumannii were MDR related isolates. The rate of MDR A baumannii was highest in the inpatient setting (58.6% of isolates from all body sources), followed by admission setting (43.2%), and ambulatory setting (24.8%).
 The important need for new treatment options for serious bacterial infections was further highlighted by the passage in the United States in July 2012 of the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now, or GAIN, Act, which provides regulatory incentives for the development of new antibacterial or antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections that are resistant to existing treatment. In September 2014, the United States’ President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology issued a report providing recommendations to combat the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria and advising that without rapid action, the United States risks losing the tremendous progress made in antibiotic development over the last century. Their recommendations focused on three areas: improving surveillance, increasing longevity of current antibiotics and increasing the rate at which new antibiotics are discovered and developed. 
 New legislative initiatives have been approved as part of the 21st Century Cures Act, including the Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment Act which would provide a pathway for approval of antibiotics in limited populations of patients with few or no suitable treatment options. Other legislation still pending include the Developing an Innovative Strategy for Antimicrobial Resistant Microorganisms, or DISARM, Act which would designate certain novel antibiotics used to treat serious bacterial infections to receive higher Medicare reimbursement, and an amendment to the GAIN Act, which would allow successful QIDP sponsors to transfer up to one year of exclusivity to another product, including products marketed by other companies.

Limitations of Available Treatment Options
 When confronted with a new patient suffering from a serious infection caused by an unknown pathogen, a physician may be required to quickly initiate first-line empiric antibiotic treatment to stabilize the patient prior to definitively diagnosing the particular bacterial infection. However, current antibiotics for first-line empiric treatment of serious bacterial infections suffer from significant limitations, including one or more of the following:
 Insufficient Coverage of Multidrug-resistant Bacteria. A physician cannot risk prescribing an inappropriate antibiotic when initially treating a patient for a serious infection where the pathogen has not yet been definitively identified. Frequently used products, such as linezoid and daptomycin, are limited to Gram-positive bacteria and thus are rarely used as a first-line empiric monotherapy if broad bacterial coverage is required. Recently approved products are limited to specific Gram-negative bacteria and thus are rarely used as a first-line empiric monotherapy if broad bacterial coverage is required. In addition, other popular antibiotics that have been used as first-line empiric monotherapies, such as levofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, and imipenem/cilastatin, have seen their utility as first-line empiric monotherapies diminished as the number of bacterial strains resistant to these therapies has increased.
 Complicated and Expensive Multi-Drug Cocktails and Multi-Dose Regimens. Due to gaps in the spectrum of coverage of antibiotics, physicians are often confronted with the need to design complicated multi-drug cocktails for the first-line empiric treatment of patients with serious infections. The clinical situation is further complicated when each drug in the multi-drug cocktail has a different dosing regimen, such as three or four times a day, resulting in an added burden on the pharmacy and nursing staff, higher costs due to multiple drug administrations and an increased potential for medical errors or drug-drug interactions. We believe that, with the exception of eravacycline, most of the antibiotics that are in development or have recently been approved by the FDA that are intended to cover a broad range of bacteria, including Gram-negative bacteria, or solely to address Gram-negative bacteria, are being developed or are approved for use in combination with one or more other antibiotics, and require the addition of a third drug such as metronidazole to address the presence of anaerobic bacteria.
 Safety and Tolerability Concerns. Concerns about antibiotic safety and tolerability are among the leading reasons why patients stop treatment and fail therapy. Antibiotics on the market have been associated with adverse effects such as myelosuppression, seizures, nephrotoxicity and gastrointestinal disorders.
 Given these limitations, there is an unmet medical need for a first-line empiric antibiotic treatment that has the following characteristics:
  
• | Potency and effectiveness against a broad range of bacteria, including multidrug-resistant Gram-negative, Gram-positive, atypical and anaerobic bacteria;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capability of being used as a monotherapy in the majority of patients in the hospital with cIAI and other multidrug-resistant infections;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A convenient dosing regimen, such as once or twice-daily; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | A favorable safety and tolerability profile.
--+---------------------------------------------

 Based on our belief that eravacycline and our other pipeline candidates have, or potentially have, each of these characteristics, our goal is to develop eravacycline and our other pipeline candidates to be the drug of choice for first-line empiric treatment of a wide variety of serious and life-threatening infections.

Eravacycline
 Overview
 We are developing our lead product candidate, eravacycline, as an IV antibiotic for use as a first-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of resistant and multidrug-resistant infections, including multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in patients, such as those with cIAI. We developed eravacycline using our proprietary chemistry technology. 
 To date, we have completed four phase 3 clinical trials with eravacycline: IGNITE1 and IGNITE4, each a phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of eravacycline with IV administration for the treatment of cIAI; IGNITE2, a phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of eravacycline with IV-to-oral transition therapy for the treatment of cUTI and IGNITE3, a phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of eravacycline with IV administration

 for the treatment of cUTI. 
 In December 2014, we announced that in IGNITE1, eravacycline met the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority compared to the control therapy for the trial. In the third quarter of 2017 we submitted a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the EMA for IV eravacycline for the treatment of cIAI primarily based upon the results of IGNITE1. In July 2017, we announced that in IGNITE4, eravacycline met the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority compared to the control therapy for the trial. On January 2, 2018, we announced the submission of an NDA, to the FDA for IV eravacycline for the treatment of cIAI. The NDA submission includes data from the IGNITE1 and IGNITE4 phase 3 clinical trials. The PDUFA goal date is August 28, 2018 for the FDA to complete its review of our NDA.
 In September 2015, we announced that eravacycline did not meet the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority in IGNITE2 compared to the control therapy for this trial. In February 2018, we announced that eravacycline did not meet the co-primary endpoints of statistical non-inferiority in IGNITE3 compared to the control therapy for this trial. Given the IGNITE3 results, we are no longer evaluating IV eravacycline for the treatment of cUTI and have also ceased development of an oral formulation for eravacycline for the treatment of cUTI.
Tetracycline antibiotics have been in clinical use for over 50 years and have a demonstrated record of 
safety and effectiveness. However, as with most classes of antibiotics, a high incidence of resistance among many bacteria has limited their effectiveness and resulted in tetracyclines being relegated to second- or third-line therapy several decades after their introduction. Chemists have generally been unable to synthesize new tetracyclines that could overcome bacterial resistance mechanisms. We have used our proprietary chemistry technology to create more than 3,000 new tetracycline derivatives that we believe could not be practically created with conventional methods. Many of these new derivatives, including eravacycline, have been able to overcome bacterial resistance in in vitro studies.
 Eravacycline is a novel, fully synthetic fluorocycline antibiotic. We selected eravacycline for development from tetracycline derivatives that we generated using our proprietary chemistry technology.
 In designing eravacycline, we inserted a fluorine atom into the tetracycline scaffold, which we call a fluorocycline, and modified the scaffold at another position. We believe that these modifications enable eravacycline to not be subject to tetracycline-specific mechanisms of drug resistance. As a result, we believe that eravacycline is active against multidrug-resistant bacteria in ways that tetracyclines currently on the market or in development are not.
 In in vitro studies, including a surveillance study published in December 2014 using over 4,000 patient bacterial isolates collected in New York City, eravacycline has been highly active against emerging multidrug-resistant pathogens like Acinetobacter baumannii as well as clinically important species of Enterobacteriaceae, including those isolates that produce ESBLs or are resistant to the carbapenem class of antibiotics, and anaerobes, in comparison to commonly used antibiotics.
 Data published in August 2016 demonstrated that eravacycline retained potency against E. coli clinical isolates containing a plasmid expressing mcr-1 (ERV MIC90=0.5 µg/mL; colistin MIC90=16 µg/mL). The in vitro potency of eravacycline was unaffected by inducible overexpression of the mcr-1 gene in an engineered laboratory E. coli strain.
 Eravacycline has also demonstrated strong activity in vitro against Gram-positive pathogens, including both nosocomial and community-acquired methicillin susceptible or resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, vancomycin susceptible or resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-susceptible or resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. In in vitro studies of pathogens most prevalent in cIAI infections, eravacycline consistently exhibited strong activity against enterococci and streptococci. One of the most frequently isolated anaerobic pathogens in cIAI, either as the sole pathogen or often in conjunction with another Gram-negative bacterium, is Bacteroides fragilis. In these studies eravacycline demonstrated activity against Bacteroides fragilis and a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes.

Key Differentiating Attributes of Eravacycline
 We believe that the following key attributes of eravacycline, observed in clinical trials and preclinical studies, differentiate eravacycline from other antibiotics targeting multidrug-resistant infections, including multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections. We believe these attributes will make eravacycline a safe and effective treatment for cIAI and potentially other serious and life-threatening infections for which we may develop eravacycline.

• | Offers a broad range of activity against a wide variety of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative, Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. In our phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials of the IV formulation of eravacycline, eravacycline demonstrated a high cure rate against a wide variety of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative, Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. In addition, in in vitro studies, eravacycline demonstrated potent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae; Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CRE); MCR-1 gene resistance bacteria; Acinetobacter baumannii, including carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter (CRAB); Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, or VRE; and anaerobic pathogens. As a result, we believe that eravacycline has the potential to be used as a first-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of cIAI and potentially other serious and life-threatening infections.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lower probability of drug resistance. To date, in the clinical trials and preclinical studies of eravacycline that we have conducted for the treatment of cIAI, we have seen little decrease in susceptibility that would suggest increased resistance to eravacycline. We believe that, as a fluorocycline, eravacycline will not be subject to tetracycline-specific mechanisms of drug resistance in certain multidrug-resistant, or MDR, pathogens.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Favorable safety and tolerability profile. Eravacycline has been evaluated in over 2,700 subjects in the phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials that we have conducted through February 2018. In these trials, eravacycline has demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. In our phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials of eravacycline in patients with cIAI, no patients suffered any drug-related serious adverse events, and safety and tolerability were comparable to the respective control therapies for the trials. In the phase 3 clinical trials of eravacycline in patients with cUTI, safety and tolerability were comparable to the respective control therapies for these trials. In addition, in these phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials, the rate at which gastrointestinal adverse events such as nausea and emesis occurred in the eravacycline arms was low.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convenient dosing regimen. In our clinical trials to date, we have dosed eravacycline once or twice a day as a monotherapy. We believe that eravacycline will be able to be administered as a first-line empiric monotherapy with twice-daily dosing, avoiding the need for complicated dosing regimens typical of multi-drug cocktails and the increased risk of negative drug-drug interactions inherent to multi-drug cocktails.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinical Experience
 We have studied IV and oral formulations of eravacycline in over 2,700 subjects in 21 clinical trials completed from October 2009 to February 2018.
 Phase 3 Clinical Program
 We designed our IGNITE phase 3 program for eravacycline to enable us to position eravacycline as a first-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of cIAI and cUTI due to eravacycline’s broad-range of coverage against resistant and multidrug-resistant infections, including multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections. We are now focusing our efforts on the development of eravacycline for the treatment of cIAI.
 cIAI
 Our initial phase 3 clinical trial of eravacycline for the treatment of patients with cIAI was our IGNITE1 trial. In December 2014, we announced that eravacycline met the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority compared to ertapenem in IGNITE1 for the treatment of cIAI. In July 2017, we announced that eravacycline met the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority compared to meropenem in IGNITE4 for the treatment of cIAI. 
 On January 2, 2018, we announced the submission of an NDA to the FDA for IV eravacycline for the treatment of cIAI. The NDA submission includes data from the IGNITE1 and IGNITE4 phase 3 clinical trials. The PDUFA goal date is August 28, 2018 for the FDA to complete its review of our NDA. In the third quarter of 2017 we submitted an MAA to the EMA for IV eravacycline for the treatment of cIAI primarily based upon the results of IGNITE1.

IGNITE1
 Eravacycline Phase 3 IGNITE1 Study Design
 
We designed IGNITE1 as a non-inferiority study. Under FDA guidance, the primary endpoint of the trial was clinical response at the TOC visit in the microbiological intent-to-treat, or micro-ITT, population which consisted of all randomized patients in the trial who had baseline bacterial pathogens that cause cIAI and against which eravacycline has antibacterial activity. Under EMA guidance, the primary endpoint of the trial was clinical response at the TOC visit in the modified intent-to-treat, or MITT, population which consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study drug, and in the clinically evaluable, or CE, patient population, which consisted of all randomized patients in the trial who meet key inclusion/exclusion criteria and follow other important components of the trial. We designed the trial to be consistent with the FDA’s cIAI guidance, in which the FDA suggested that the primary efficacy endpoint for a trial of cIAI should be complete resolution of baseline signs and symptoms attributable to cIAI in the micro-ITT patient population 28 days after randomization and the absence of clinical failure including death and unplanned surgical procedures through the period ending 28 days following randomization.
 In December 2014, we announced top-line data from IGNITE1. In the trial, eravacycline met the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority of clinical response at the TOC visit, under the guidance set by the FDA and the EMA. The primary analysis under the FDA guidance was conducted using a 10% non-inferiority margin in the micro-ITT population. In the micro-ITT population, the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval were -7.1% and 5.5%, respectively. Under the EMA guidance, the primary analysis was conducted using a 12.5% non-inferiority margin in the CE and MITT patient populations. In the CE population, the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval were -6.3% and 2.8%, respectively, and the lower and upper bounds of the 99% confidence interval were -7.9% and 4.4%, respectively. In the MITT population, the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval were -7.4% and 3.8%, respectively, and the lower and upper bounds of the 99% confidence interval were -9.2% and 5.6%, respectively. The most commonly reported drug-related adverse events for eravacycline were gastrointestinal, including nausea (3.3%) and emesis (2.2%). This adverse event profile for eravacycline was consistent with that seen in the phase 2 clinical trial of eravacycline in cIAI. The spectrum of pathogens in this trial was similar to that seen in other pivotal trials of antibiotics in this patient population. The most common Gram-negative pathogens in the trial included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas and Bacteroides.

IGNITE4
 Eravacycline Phase 3 IGNITE4 Study Design
 
We designed IGNITE4 as a non-inferiority study. Under FDA guidance, the primary endpoint of the trial was clinical response at the TOC visit in the microbiological intent-to-treat, or micro-ITT, population, which consisted of randomized patients in the trial who had baseline bacterial pathogens that cause cIAI and against which eravacycline has antibacterial activity. Under EMA guidance, the primary endpoint of the trial was clinical response at the TOC visit in the modified intent-to-treat, or MITT, population, which consisted of patients in the trial who received at least one dose of study drug, and in the clinically evaluable, or CE, patient population, which consisted of patients in the trial who met key inclusion/exclusion criteria and followed other important components of the trial. Secondary endpoints included clinical response at the end-of-treatment, TOC and follow-up visits in the intent-to-treat population, the CE population, the micro-ITT population and the microbiologically evaluable, or ME, population. The ME population consisted of all micro-ITT patients who met key inclusion/exclusion criteria and followed other important components of the trial. In the trial, we also studied microbiologic response at the end-of-treatment and TOC visits in the micro-ITT and ME populations, the safety and tolerability of eravacycline in the safety population and pharmacokinetic parameters after eravacycline administration.
 On July 25, 2017, we announced top-line data from IGNITE4. In the trial, eravacycline met the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority of clinical response at the TOC visit, under the guidance set by the FDA and the EMA. The primary efficacy analysis under the FDA guidance was conducted using a 12.5% non-inferiority margin in the micro-ITT population. Clinical cure rates in the micro-ITT population were 90.8% and 91.2% for eravacycline (n=195) and meropenem (n=205), respectively (95% CI: -6.3%,5.3%). Under the EMA guidance, the primary analysis was conducted using a 12.5% non-inferiority margin of the MITT and CE patient populations. Clinical cure rates in the MITT population were 92.4% and 91.6% for eravacycline (n=250) and meropenem (n=249), respectively (95% CI: -4.1%,5.8%). Clinical cure rates in the CE population were 96.9% and 96.1% for eravacycline (n=225) and meropenem (n=231), respectively (95% CI: -2.9%,4.5%). The secondary analyses were consistent with, and supportive of, the primary outcome. The most commonly reported drug-related adverse events for eravacycline were gastrointestinal, including nausea (2.4%) and emesis (1.6%). This adverse event profile for eravacycline was consistent with that seen in the phase 2 clinical trial of eravacycline in cIAI. The spectrum of pathogens in this trial was similar to that seen in other pivotal trials of antibiotics in this patient population. The most common Gram-negative pathogens in the trial included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas and Bacteroides.
 

cUTI
 Our initial 
phase 3 clinical trial of eravacycline for the treatment of patients with cUTI was our IGNITE2 trial. In September 2015, we announced that eravacycline did not meet the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority compared to levofloxacin in IGNITE2 for the treatment of cUTI.

Following the failure of eravacycline to meet the primary endpoint of IGNITE2, and based on discussions with the FDA, we determined to conduct our IGNITE3 phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the IV formulation of eravacycline in patients with cUTI and to continue our development program for an oral formulation of eravacycline. 
 IGNITE3
 IGNITE3 was a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multi-center, prospective study that is designed to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of once-daily IV eravacycline (1.5mg/kg every 24 hours) compared to ertapenem (1g every 24 hours), the control therapy in this trial, for the treatment of cUTI. We enrolled approximately 1,200 adult patients in the trial, who were randomized 1:1 to receive eravacycline or ertapenem for a minimum of 5 days and were then be eligible for transition to an approved oral agent. The co-primary endpoints of responder rate (a combination of clinical cure and microbiological success) in the micro-ITT population at the end-of-IV treatment visit and at the TOC visit (Day 5-10 post therapy) were evaluated using a 10% non-inferiority margin.  
 On February 13, 2018, we announced top-line data from our IGNITE3 trial. In this trial, eravacycline did not meet the co-primary endpoints of responder rate, a combination of clinical cure and microbiological success, in the micro-ITT, population at the end-of-IV treatment visit and at the test-of-cure visit.
 
Responder rates in the micro-ITT population at the end-of-IV treatment visit were 84.8% and 94.8% for eravacycline (n=428) and ertapenem (n=403), respectively (-10.0% CI: -14.1%, -6.0%). Responder rates at the TOC visit were 68.5% and 74.9% for eravacycline (n=428) and ertapenem (n=403), respectively (-6.5% CI: -12.6%, -0.3%). While eravacycline was well tolerated in this trial, it did not meet the co-primary endpoints. Non-inferiority to ertapenem was not demonstrated. We continue to analyze the data of this study. However, given the IGNITE3 results, we are no longer evaluating IV eravacycline for the treatment of cUTI and have also ceased development of an oral formulation for eravacycline for the treatment of cUTI.
 IGNITE2
 IGNITE2 was a two-part, multi-center, randomized, double-blind phase 3 clinical trial, our IGNITE2 trial, to assess the efficacy and safety of eravacycline compared with levofloxacin in the treatment of cUTI. We enrolled 143 patients in the lead-in portion of the trial. These patients were randomized into three arms on a 1:1:1 basis: an arm in which patients received 1.5 mg/kg IV eravacycline every 24 hours followed by 200 mg of eravacycline orally every 12 hours; an arm in which patients received 1.5 mg/kg IV eravacycline every 24 hours followed by 250 mg of eravacycline orally every 12 hours; and an arm in which patients received 750 mg IV levofloxacin every 24 hours followed by 750 mg of levofloxacin orally every 24 hours.
 We enrolled 908 patients in the pivotal portion of the trial. These patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive 1.5 mg/kg IV eravacycline every 24 hours followed by 200 mg of eravacycline orally every 12 hours or 750 mg IV levofloxacin every 24 hours followed by 750 mg of levofloxacin orally every 24 hours. In both treatment arms, subjects received a minimum of three days of IV therapy and then, if clinically indicated, were eligible to transition to oral therapy for the remaining doses for a total treatment period of 7 days. We designed the pivotal portion of the trial as a non-inferiority study in compliance with both FDA and EMA guidance. Under FDA guidance, the primary endpoint of the pivotal portion of the trial was clinical and microbiological response in the micro-ITT population at the PT visit. Under EMA guidance, the primary endpoint of the pivotal portion of the trial was microbiological response in the micro-MITT and ME populations. The micro-MITT population consisted of any patient who received study drug who had baseline bacterial pathogens that cause cUTI and against which eravacycline has antibacterial activity. The ME population consisted of all micro-ITT patients who met key inclusion/exclusion criteria and followed other important components of the trial. In order to achieve the primary endpoint under both FDA and EMA guidance, eravacycline would have needed to demonstrate non-inferiority as compared to levofloxacin within a margin of no more than 10%. A key secondary endpoint in IGNITE2 was to test for superiority of eravacycline over levofloxacin in the treatment of cUTI for those subjects with infections caused by quinolone-resistant pathogens by evaluation of clinical and microbiological response in the micro-ITT population at the PT visit.
 
In September 2015, we announced that eravacycline did not meet the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority compared to levofloxacin in IGNITE2 for the treatment of cUTI under the guidance set by the FDA. The primary analysis under the FDA guidance was conducted using a 10% non-inferiority margin in the micro-ITT population. In the micro-ITT population, the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval were -14.1% and 1.2%, respectively.

Previous clinical trials of eravacycline
 Phase 2 clinical trial of IV formulation in cIAI
 In June 2012, we completed a global, multi-center, randomized, double-blind phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of the IV formulation of eravacycline compared to ertapenem in patients with cIAI. 
 We enrolled 143 hospitalized patients with cIAI in the trial. These patients were randomized into three arms on a 2:2:1 basis: an arm in which patients received 1.5 mg/kg IV eravacycline administered once per day; an arm in which patients received 1.0 mg/kg IV eravacycline administered twice per day; and a control arm in which patients received 1.0 g IV ertapenem administered once per day, which is the standard dosing regimen for ertapenem.
 Investigators obtained baseline intra-abdominal cultures at the time of operation and treated patients for a minimum of four days and a maximum of 14 days. The length of treatment for each patient was determined by the physician based on pre-set parameters. A TOC visit took place ten to 14 days after the last dose of drug was administered and a final or follow-up visit occurred within four to six weeks after the last dose of drug was administered.
 In the trial, ME patients in the eravacycline arms experienced similar infection cure rates to the ME patients in the ertapenem arm, as summarized in the table below. The table also shows the 95% confidence interval, a statistical determination that demonstrates the range of possible differences in the point estimates of success that will arise 95% of the time the endpoint is measured.
 Eravacycline Phase 2 Trial Primary Endpoint Analysis
 
 
Population | Eravacycline (1.5 mg/kg every 24 hours) | Eravacycline (1.0 mg/kg every 12 hours) | Ertapenem (1.0 g Every 24 hours)
---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------
Microbiologically Evaluable (ME) | N=42 | N=41 | N=26 
% Cure in ME (95% Confidence Interval) | 92.9 (80.5-98.5) | 100 (91.4-100) | 92.3 (74.9-99.1) 

 
Investigators in the trial had the discretion to determine the period that patients remained on the applicable treatment. The mean duration of treatment in the trial was 6.1 days for the patients receiving 1.5 mg/kg IV eravacycline administered once per day; 5.6 days for the patients receiving 1.0 mg/kg IV eravacycline administered twice per day; and 6.0 days for the patients receiving 1.0 g IV ertapenem administered once per day.

The figure below shows the overall pathogen mix identified in the phase 2 cIAI clinical trial. Of the pathogens isolated from the micro-MITT patients enrolled in the phase 2 clinical trial, approximately 60% were members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. Micro-MITT patients in the trial were infected with an average of 1.8 pathogens. The Gram-negative aerobic pathogens occurring most frequently were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii complex and Morganella morganii. The Gram-positive aerobic pathogens occurring most frequently were Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. The anaerobic pathogens occurring most frequently were Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium spp.

Of particular importance in the trial results was the performance of eravacycline against confirmed drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens as well as other challenging Gram-negative pathogens. Due to the global, multi-center nature of the trial and our emphasis on sites in known geographic “hot spots” for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, 25% of the Gram-negative pathogens identified in micro-MITT patients were confirmed to be multidrug-resistant as a result of being ESBL-positive and/or carbapenem-resistant. The figure below shows that the patients cured with eravacycline in the phase 2 cIAI clinical trial had 23 confirmed multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.

In the phase 2 clinical trial, eravacycline demonstrated a comparable safety and tolerability profile to ertapenem. No patients in the trial suffered any serious adverse events that were found to be related to eravacycline, and the percentage of patients in the trial arms that experienced treatment emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, were similar. In addition, gastrointestinal adverse events known to be associated with tetracyclines such as nausea and emesis, occurred at low rates in the eravacycline arms that were similar to the rates for the ertapenem arm. Adverse events associated with infusion sites were limited and similar in all treatment groups.

Phase 1 clinical trials of IV formulation
 We studied the IV formulation of eravacycline in several phase 1 clinical trials in a total of 140 healthy volunteers and at doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 3.0 mg/kg. No serious adverse events were reported during the phase 1 clinical trials and no clinically significant dose-related safety signals were reported. As expected in this class of antibiotics, transient gastrointestinal adverse events such as nausea and emesis were observed at the higher dose levels in the phase 1 clinical trials. Additionally, pharmacokinetic data demonstrates that eravacycline achieves high concentration levels in the blood and urine.
 TP-271
 TP-271 is a fully-synthetic, broad-spectrum fluorocycline being developed for respiratory diseases caused by bacterial biothreat pathogens under funding provided by NIAID. We are collaborating with CUBRC on the TP-271 program funded by NIAID.
 We created TP-271 using our proprietary chemistry technology. In doing so, we made modifications to the tetracycline scaffold that were designed to improve potency and effectiveness against a broader spectrum of bacteria as compared to tetracycline and doxycycline, which are currently used for the treatment of pneumonia and other respiratory ailments.
 In our development program for TP-271, we have conducted a number of in vitro, toxicology and animal studies to evaluate the efficacy of TP-271 against biothreat pathogens. TP-271 has performed as well as, or better than, standard-of-care comparators in studies in murine respiratory infection models challenged with public health pathogens. In susceptibility studies, TP-271 also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity against NIAID Category A and B public health bacterial pathogens including Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Bacillus anthracis, and NIAID Category C public health bacterial pathogens (in vitro and in vivo) that are associated with CABP, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant pneumococci, Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Legionella pneumophila, including strains that are tetracycline-resistant. 
 In June 2017, we announced positive results from a phase 1 single-ascending dose clinical trial of the IV formulation of TP-271 in healthy volunteers. In the study, TP-271 was well tolerated at single doses that resulted in high plasma exposures. There were no clinically significant changes in lab values, ECG parameters, or physical exam findings. There were no serious or severe adverse events, or discontinuations due to an adverse event during the study. We are conducting a multiple-ascending dose trial for the IV formulation of TP-271. In 2017 we completed a single ascending dose phase 1 study for the oral formulation of TP-271. Using this formulation, in early 2018 we initiated a multiple-ascending dose phase 1 study for the oral formulation of TP-271. In February 2017, we also received Qualified Infectious Disease Product and Fast Track designations from the FDA.
 Funding for TP-271 is covered by two awards from NIAID. The first award is a grant awarded to CUBRC in July 2011 that provides up to approximately $2.9 million in funding, which we refer to as the NIAID Grant. The second award is a contract awarded to CUBRC in September 2011 that provides up to approximately $35.8 million in funding. The NIAID Grant and the NIAID Contract each support the development, manufacturing and clinical evaluation of TP-271 for respiratory diseases caused by biothreat and antibiotic-resistant public health pathogens, including Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis and Bacillus anthracis, as well as bacterial pathogens associated with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. 
 In connection with the NIAID Contract, in October 2011, we entered into a cost-plus-fixed-fee subcontract with CUBRC under which we may receive funding of up to approximately $16.9 million, reflecting the portion of the NIAID Contract funding that may be paid to us for our activities. In connection with the NIAID Grant, in November 2011, CUBRC awarded us a subaward of approximately $0.9 million, reflecting the portion of the NIAID Grant funding that may be paid to us for our activities.
 The NIAID Grant expired in May 2017. Although the NIAID Contract and our subcontract with CUBRC under the NIAID Contract have terms which currently expire on March 31, 2019, NIAID is entitled to terminate the project for convenience at any time, and is not obligated to provide continued funding beyond March 31, 2019. To the extent that NIAID ceases to provide funding of the programs to CUBRC, CUBRC has the right to cease providing funding to us. As of December 31, 2017, committed funding from CUBRC under the subcontract with respect to the NIAID Contract and the subaward with respect to the NIAID Grant is $16.9 million, of which $13.2 million had been received through December 31, 2017. Through December 31, 2017, the Company had received all committed funding of $0.9 million from CUBRC under the Company’s subaward with respect to the NIAID Grant. 
 TP-6076
 TP-6076, a fully-synthetic fluorocycline derivative, is the lead candidate under our second-generation program to target unmet medical needs, including multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. In June 2017, we announced positive results from a phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-ascending dose study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics 
 13


of IV TP-6076. In the study, TP-6076 was well tolerated, and there were no serious or severe adverse events, or discontinuations due to an adverse event. There were no clinically significant safety findings in any laboratory assessments, vital signs, ECGs or physical examinations. We also are conducting a multiple-ascending study in healthy volunteers of the IV formulation of TP-6076. 
 Funding for TP-6076 is partially covered by an award from CARB-X. In March 2017, CARB-X selected us to receive up to $4.0 million in research funding over eighteen months for TP-6076. In connection with this funding, we entered into a cost reimbursement Sub-Award Agreement or “Sub-Award Agreement”, with the Trustees of Boston University, the administrator of the program. We began recognizing revenue from the Sub-Award Agreement in April 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized revenue of $0.7 million under this Sub-Award Agreement. This Sub-Award Agreement will fund certain activities through the end of 2018. This Sub-Award Agreement can be terminated for convenience at any time, subject to 30 days prior written notice.
 Commercialization Strategy
 Our commercialization strategy is to develop our product candidates into leading therapies that will be available worldwide for the treatment of serious multidrug-resistant infections. We have retained worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates other than eravacycline in China and other Asian territories. We exclusively licensed our commercial rights in China and other Asian territories to Everest Medicines Limited in February 2018. In the future we may enter into additional regional licensing transactions similar to the Everest license agreement. We intend to retain control over the commercial execution of each of our product candidates in the United States.
 We are currently developing our lead product candidate, eravacycline, as an IV antibiotic for use as a first-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of serious and life-threatening infections, including a wide variety of multidrug-resistant infections, such as those found in patients with cIAI. We intend to directly commercialize eravacycline in the United States. We intend to build a commercial organization in the United States, and recruit experienced sales and medical education professionals and to develop a commercial strategy to target institutions with the greatest use of drugs for multidrug-resistant serious and life-threatening infections. We expect that our sales force will focus on educating hospital and institution-based physicians, nurses, pharmacy directors and payers about the benefits of eravacycline for the product’s approved indications. We plan to commercialize eravacycline outside the United States with the assistance of collaborators.
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. All of our product candidates are organic compounds of low molecular weight, commonly referred to as small molecules. They are manufactured in a fully synthetic process from readily available starting materials. 
 We currently rely on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, drug substance and finished product for our preclinical research and clinical trials. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these third parties. We also do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of any of our product candidates after they are approved. If any of our products are approved by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with third-party contract manufacturers for the commercial production of those products. We currently employ internal resources to manage our manufacturing.
 Patheon UK Limited Master Manufacturing Services Agreement
 In June 2017, we and Patheon UK Limited and certain of its affiliates, or Patheon, entered into a master manufacturing services agreement, or the Patheon agreement. Under the Patheon agreement, we are responsible for supplying the active pharmaceutical ingredient for eravacycline to Patheon, and Patheon is responsible for manufacturing eravacycline, conducting quality control, quality assurance, analytical testing and stability testing and packaging. We entered into two related product agreements pursuant to the Patheon agreement that govern the terms and conditions of Patheon’s manufacture of commercial supplies of eravacycline at Patheon’s Greenville, North Carolina and Ferentino, Italy manufacturing sites. Each product agreement is governed by the terms of the Patheon agreement, unless expressly modified in such product agreement. Pursuant to the Patheon agreement, we have agreed to order from Patheon at least a certain percentage of our annual commercial requirements for eravacycline in the United States and European Union each year for the term of the Patheon agreement.
 The Patheon agreement has an initial term ending December 31, 2022, and will automatically renew after the initial term for successive terms of two years each, unless either party gives notice of its intention to terminate at least 18 months prior to the end of the then current term. We may terminate a product agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice if any governmental agency takes any 
 14


action that prevents us from importing, exporting, purchasing or selling eravacycline. Either party may terminate the Patheon agreement or a product agreement (a) upon written notice if the other party has failed to remedy a material breach under the Patheon agreement or a product agreement within a specified time following receipt of written notice of such breach, and (b) immediately upon written notice to the other party in the event that the other party is declared insolvent or bankrupt, a voluntary petition of bankruptcy is filed in any court by such other party or the Pantheon agreement or a product agreement is assigned by such other party for the benefit of creditors. Patheon may terminate the Patheon agreement or a product agreement upon six months written notice if we assign the Patheon agreement to an assignee that, in the opinion of Patheon acting reasonably, is (i) not a creditworthy substitute for us or (ii) a competitor of Patheon.
 The Patheon agreement contains, among other provisions, customary representations and warranties by the parties, a grant to Patheon of certain limited license rights to our intellectual property in connection with Patheon’s performance of the services under the Patheon agreement, certain indemnification rights in favor of both parties, limitations of liability and customary confidentiality provisions.
 Finorga SAS Commercial Supply Agreement
 In October 2017, we and Finorga SAS, or Novasep entered into a Commercial Supply Agreement, or the Novasep agreement. Under the Novasep agreement, Novasep will, pursuant to accepted purchase orders entered into under the Novasep agreement, manufacture for commercial supply the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for eravacycline for us.
 Under the Novasep agreement, we will submit to Novasep on a periodic basis on or before the first business day of each calendar quarter a rolling forecast for a certain time period that sets forth the total quantity of the API for eravacycline for commercial supply that we either have ordered, desire to order or expect to order from Novasep. A certain time period of each such forecast is binding on us and constitutes a “firm order”. The remainder of each forecast will be for planning purposes only, and will not be binding. Novasep has no obligation to manufacture the API for eravacycline in accordance with any forecast that is not the subject of a firm order and which is increased by a certain percentage above the previously forecast amount.
 The Novasep agreement has an initial term ending October 16, 2022, and will automatically renew after the initial term, unless either party gives notice of its intention to terminate at least 18 months prior to the end of the then current term. We may terminate the Novasep agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice (a) if any regulatory authority takes any action, or raises any objection, that prevents us from importing, exporting, purchasing or selling the API for eravacycline, or (b) in the event that Novasep experiences a force majeure event. Either party may terminate the Novasep agreement (a) upon written notice if the other party has failed to remedy a material breach under the Novasep agreement within a specified time following receipt of written notice of such breach, and (b) immediately upon written notice to the other party in the event the other party makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or proceedings of a case are commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction by or against the other party seeking (i) such party’s reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, arrangement or winding up, or the composition or readjustment of its debts, (ii) the appointment of a receiver or trustee for or over such party’s property, or (iii) similar relief in respect of such party under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, winding up or composition or adjustment of debt, and such proceedings shall continue undismissed, or an order with respect to the foregoing shall be entered and continue unstayed, for a period of more than 60 days.
 The Novasep agreement contains, among other provisions, customary representations and warranties by the parties, a grant to Novasep of certain limited license rights to the Company’s intellectual property in connection with Novasep’s performance of the services under the Novasep agreement, certain indemnification rights in favor of both parties, limitations of liability and customary confidentiality provisions.
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 Our success will significantly depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology and inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

As of February 26, 2018, we owned nine U.S. patents, 42 foreign patents, seven pending U.S. patent applications, three pending applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, and 62 pending foreign patent applications in Europe and 20 other jurisdictions. The PCT is an international patent law treaty that provides a unified procedure for filing a single initial patent application for an invention simultaneously in each of the member states. Although a PCT application is not itself examined and cannot issue as a patent, it allows the applicant to seek protection in any of the member states through national-phase applications. In addition, we have exclusively licensed from Harvard University rights under 12 U.S. patents, 30 foreign patents, one pending U.S. patent application and eight pending foreign patent applications in Europe and ten other jurisdictions. Certain of our patents and patent applications are directed to the composition of matter and/or use of eravacycline and patents have granted or applications are pending in the United States, Europe, Japan and other countries.
 Tetraphase-Owned Intellectual Property Relating to Eravacycline and Other Compounds Under Development
 We have patent applications directed to the composition of matter and/or use of eravacycline and other fluorocyclines pending in the United States and other countries. Patents specific to the composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions and/or use of eravacycline have been granted in the United States, Europe, Australia, China, Colombia, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Israel and Singapore. The granted patents have an expiration date of August 7, 2029, and any patents that may issue from the pending applications will also have an expiration date of August 7, 2029, absent any term extensions or adjustments that may be available. The term of one of the U.S. patents has received 508 days of patent term adjustment under the America Invents Act.
 We have also filed patent applications directed to the composition of matter and use of various derivatives of tetracycline and pentacycline (a tetracycline scaffold extended to five rings) under the PCT and in the United States, Europe and other foreign countries. Any patents that might issue from these pending applications will have an expiration date no earlier than 2030, with some expiration dates as late as 2038.
 Exclusively Licensed Intellectual Property Relating to Our Proprietary Chemistry Technology
 The patents and patent applications that we exclusively license from Harvard provide patent protection for the proprietary chemistry technology used in our fully synthetic process to make eravacycline and other tetracycline derivatives. The key intermediates that enable our fully synthetic process are commonly referred to as enone intermediates. The licensed patents and patent applications are directed towards the composition of matter of enone intermediates and compounds used to make the enone intermediates, referred to as key precursors, as well as synthetic routes to those enone intermediates, precursors and our tetracycline derivatives under development.
 Composition of matter for the enone intermediates and precursors used in preparing the enone intermediates, and methods of making the precursors and enone intermediates are covered by the U.S. patents we license from Harvard, which will expire no earlier than 2025, not taking into consideration patent term adjustment. Corresponding patent applications have been filed in foreign jurisdictions and any patents that have issued and might issue from these applications also expire or will expire no earlier than 2025.
 Exclusively Licensed Intellectual Property Relating to Pentacycline and Tetracycline Derivatives
 Our license from Harvard also includes patent applications directed to the composition of matter and use of other novel tetracycline or pentacycline derivatives. These applications are pending in the United States, Europe and other countries. Any patents that might issue from these pending applications will have an expiration date no earlier than 2027.
 Patent Term and Patent Term Extensions
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug, biological product or medical device approved pursuant to a pre-market approval may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date set for the patent. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be granted an extension and only those claims reading on the approved drug are extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug.

Trademark Applications Relating to the Company Name and Logo 
 As of February 1, 2018, we owned ten intent-to-use trademark applications pending before the United States Patent and Trademark Office relating to the Company Name, the Company Logo, combinations thereof, design marks relating to eravacycline and potential commercial names of eravacycline.
Trade Secrets
 We rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our unpatented technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached. We may not have adequate remedies for any breach and could lose our trade secrets through such a breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting trade secrets, know-how and inventions.
Harvard University License Agreement
 On August 3, 2006, we entered into a license agreement with The President and Fellows of Harvard College, under which Harvard granted us an exclusive worldwide license under specified Harvard patent rights to develop and commercialize tetracycline-based products such as eravacycline. Under the license agreement, we also have the right to expand the patent rights subject to the license to include improvement patents that may be owned by Harvard in the future and that meet specified criteria by paying to Harvard an additional license issuance fee in an amount to be agreed between Harvard and us. We also have a right of negotiation to expand the license to include additional patents relating to tetracycline chemistry within a specified category that may be owned by Harvard in the future, including patents covering inventions made by Andrew Myers, Ph.D., our scientific founder, under his consulting agreement with us. Since entering into the license agreement, we have entered into amendments to the license agreement pursuant to which we expanded the patent rights subject to the license in accordance with these rights. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to satisfy diligence requirements, including using commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed compounds and to implement a specified development plan, meeting specified development milestones and providing an update on progress on an annual basis. Our license grant from Harvard is subject to academic rights retained by Harvard and United States government rights and obligations that are customary in patent license agreements with universities in the United States.
 In consideration for the rights granted to us by Harvard under the license agreement, as of December 31, 2017, we have paid Harvard an aggregate of $6.1 million in upfront license fees and development milestone payments, and issued 31,379 shares of our common stock to Harvard. In addition, we have agreed to make payments to Harvard upon the achievement of specified future development and regulatory milestones totaling up to $15.1 million for each licensed product candidate ($4.8 million of which has already been paid with respect to eravacycline), and to pay tiered royalties in the single digits based on annual worldwide net sales, if any, of licensed products by us, our affiliates and sublicensees in certain circumstances. We are also obligated to pay Harvard a specified share of non-royalty sublicensing and other revenues that we receive from sublicensees for the grant of sublicenses under the license in certain circumstances, and to reimburse Harvard for specified patent prosecution and maintenance costs.
 The license agreement expires on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering the applicable product in the applicable country that is included in the license. Harvard may terminate the license agreement based on our uncured material breach or insolvency or bankruptcy. We have the right to terminate the license agreement for any or no reason at any time on sixty (60) days prior written notice to Harvard.
 Government Contracts
 Eravacycline
 We received funding for eravacycline under an award from BARDA. In January 2012, BARDA awarded to CUBRC a five-year contract that provided a total of up to $67.3 million in funding. The BARDA Contract contemplates that CUBRC will collaborate with us on the development, manufacturing and clinical evaluation of a novel tetracycline antibiotic with potential as an empiric countermeasure for respiratory diseases caused by biothreat and antibiotic-resistant public health pathogens, including Francisella tularensis, which causes tularemia, Yersinia pestis, which causes plague, and Bacillus anthracis, which causes anthrax disease, as well as bacterial pathogens associated with moderate-to-severe CABP and other serious hospital infections. The BARDA Contract also provided funding for certain activities in the development of eravacycline to treat certain infections caused by life-threatening multidrug-resistant bacteria. In connection with the BARDA Contract, in February 2012, we entered into a cost-plus-fixed-fee subcontract with CUBRC under which we can receive up to $41.9 million to fund specific work performed by us related to eravacycline. The terms of the subcontract expire on December 31, 2018.
 17


We collaborated with CUBRC in seeking government funding of this development program because we did not have any expertise in bidding for, or the administration and management of, government-funded contracts. Because CUBRC had the expertise to manage and administer awards issued by government funding agencies, we agreed with CUBRC that CUBRC would serve as the prime contractor under the BARDA Contract, primarily carrying out a program management and administrative role with additional responsibility for the management of certain preclinical studies. We serve as lead technical experts on all aspects of the BARDA Contract and serve as a subcontractor of CUBRC responsible for management of chemistry, manufacturing and control activities and clinical studies. The flow of funds under this arrangement follows the respective activities being conducted by us and by CUBRC, with funds being paid to us under our subcontract with CUBRC reflecting payment for our activities.
 We have agreed upon a research plan with CUBRC detailing the activities to be conducted by CUBRC and by us. In addition to our obligations to conduct the activities provided for by the research plan, we are also obligated under the CUBRC subcontract to satisfy various federal reporting requirements, extending to technical reporting with respect to our activities, reporting with respect to intellectual property and financial reporting.
 Payments under our subcontract with CUBRC are made in installments as activities are conducted in accordance with the research plan. Payments are based on direct and indirect costs incurred plus fixed fees, where applicable.
 Under the subcontract, CUBRC’s use of our eravacycline data is expressly limited to purposes of performing CUBRC’s obligations under the BARDA Contract, and CUBRC and its other subcontractors must assign to us, subject to government rights, all intellectual property rights relating to our compounds and related data that arise from the project. Under standard government contracting terms, the government receives only limited rights for government use of certain of our pre-existing data and certain data produced with non-federal funding, to the extent such data are required for delivery to BARDA under the project. The government receives unlimited rights to use and disclose new data first produced under the project with BARDA funding, and the government is entitled to at least a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to practice or have practiced any patent on an invention that is conceived or first reduced to practice under the project.
 BARDA is entitled to terminate the project for convenience at any time, and is not obligated to provide continued funding beyond current-year amounts from Congressionally approved annual appropriations, and CUBRC has a right to terminate its subcontract with us only to the extent that BARDA first cancels the corresponding portions of CUBRC’s prime contract.
 We retain a right to terminate CUBRC’s rights to use eravacycline. Permissible grounds for such termination of CUBRC’s rights include but are not limited to the sale of our assets relating to the project, an acquisition of us or our granting an exclusive or partially exclusive license to use eravacycline to a licensee that declines to continue CUBRC’s license rights. In such an event, the subcontract may be terminated upon CUBRC’s negotiation of a corresponding termination of CUBRC’s obligations to BARDA.
 TP-271
 Our program to develop TP-271 is funded by NIAID through the NIAID Grant, a grant awarded in July 2011 that provided up to approximately $2.9 million in funding, and the NIAID Contract, a separate agreement that provides up to $35.8 million in funding that NIAID awarded to CUBRC in October 2011. The NIAID Contract and the NIAID Grant contemplate that CUBRC will collaborate with us on the development, manufacturing and clinical evaluation of a novel broad-spectrum tetracycline antibiotic for respiratory diseases caused by biothreat and antibiotic-resistant public health pathogens, including Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis and Bacillus anthracis, as well as bacterial pathogens associated with CABP. 
 In connection with the NIAID Contract, in October 2011, we entered into a subcontract with CUBRC under which we may receive funding of up to approximately $16.9 million, reflecting the portion of the NIAID Contract funding that may be paid to us for our activities. The term of the NIAID subcontract now runs through March 31, 2019. In connection with the NIAID Grant, in November 2011, CUBRC awarded us a subaward of approximately $0.9 million, reflecting the portion of the NIAID Grant funding that may be paid to us for our activities. The term of the sub-award under the NIAID grant expired in May 2017.
 We collaborated with CUBRC in seeking government funding of this development program because we did not have any expertise in bidding for, or the administration and management of, government-funded contracts. Because CUBRC had the expertise to manage and administer awards issued by government funding agencies, we agreed with CUBRC that CUBRC would serve as the prime contractor under the NIAID Contract, primarily carrying out a program management and administrative role with additional responsibility for the management of certain preclinical studies. We serve as lead technical experts on all aspects of the NIAID Contract and serve as a subcontractor of CUBRC responsible for management of chemistry, manufacturing and control activities and clinical studies. The flow of funds under this arrangement follows the respective activities being conducted by us and by CUBRC, with funds being paid to us under our subcontract with, and subaward from, CUBRC reflecting payment for our activities.
 18


We have agreed upon a research plan with CUBRC detailing the activities to be conducted by CUBRC and by us. In addition to our obligations to conduct the activities provided for by the research plan, we are also obligated under the CUBRC subcontract to satisfy various federal reporting requirements, extending to technical reporting with respect to our activities, reporting with respect to intellectual property and financial reporting.
 Payments under our subcontract with CUBRC are made in installments as activities are conducted in accordance with the research plan. Payments are based on direct and indirect costs incurred plus fixed fees, where applicable.
 Under the subcontract, CUBRC’s use and disclosure of our proprietary data pertaining to the project are expressly subject to a separate confidentiality agreement between CUBRC and us. CUBRC and its other subcontractors or subawardees must assign to us, subject to government rights, all intellectual property rights relating to our compounds and related data that arise from the project. Under standard government contracting terms and grant conditions, the government is entitled to at least a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to practice or have practiced any patent on an invention that is conceived or first reduced to practice under the project.
 NIAID is entitled to terminate the NIAID Contract for convenience at any time, and is not obligated to provide continued funding beyond March 31, 2019 and CUBRC has a right to terminate its subcontract with, or subaward to, us only to the extent that NIAID first cancels the corresponding portions of CUBRC’s prime contract or award.
 We retain rights to terminate the subcontract if CUBRC breaches the subcontract, subject in certain cases to CUBRC’s failure to cure such breach, or by written notice to CUBRC, effective upon CUBRC’s negotiation of a corresponding termination of CUBRC’s obligations to NIAID.
 TP-6076
 Our program to develop TP-6076 is partially covered by an award from CARB-X. In March 2017, CARB-X selected the Company to receive up to $4.0 million in research funding over eighteen months for TP-6076. In connection with this funding, the Company entered into a cost reimbursement Sub-Award Agreement (the “Sub-Award Agreement”) with the Trustees of Boston University, the administrator of the program. This Sub-Award Agreement will fund certain activities through the end of 2018. This Sub-Award Agreement can be terminated for convenience at any time, subject to 30 days prior written notice.
 Collaborations 
 In February 2018, we entered into a license agreement, which we call the Everest license agreement, with Everest Medicines Limited, or Everest Medicines, whereby we granted Everest Medicines an exclusive license to develop and commercialize eravacycline, for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections and other indications, in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea and Singapore, or the territory. 
 
Under the terms of the Everest license agreement, we are eligible to receive from Everest Medicines an upfront cash payment of $7.0 million to be paid within 15 business days of the effective date of the Everest license agreement, and up to an aggregate of $16.5 million in clinical development and regulatory milestone payments and up to $20.0 million annually, provided that certain sales thresholds are met. There can be no guarantee that any such milestones or sales thresholds will in fact be met. We are obligated to make certain payments to Harvard based on amounts received from Everest Medicines under the Everest license agreement pursuant to the existing license agreement by and between Harvard and us. 
 
We will also be entitled to receive double-digit tiered royalties on sales in the territory, if any, of products containing eravacycline. Royalties are payable with respect to each jurisdiction in the territory until the latest to occur of: (i) the last-to-expire of specified patent rights in such jurisdiction in the territory; (ii) expiration of marketing or regulatory exclusivity in such jurisdiction in the territory; or (iii) ten (10) years after the first commercial sale of a product in such jurisdiction in the territory. In addition, royalties payable under the Everest license agreement will be subject to reduction on account of generic competition and after patent expiry in a jurisdiction if required by applicable law, with any such reductions capped at certain percentages of the amounts otherwise payable during the applicable royalty payment period. 
 
Under the terms and conditions of the Everest license agreement, Everest Medicines will be solely responsible for the development and commercialization of licensed products in the territory. 
 If either we or Everest Medicines materially breaches the Everest license agreement and does not cure such breach within 90 days (or fewer days in certain cases), the non-breaching party may terminate the Everest license agreement in its entirety. However, 
 19


if the breach relates only to any jurisdiction other than mainland China, the non-breaching party may only terminate the Everest license agreement with respect to such jurisdiction. Either party may also terminate the Everest license agreement, effective immediately upon written notice, if the other party files for bankruptcy, is dissolved or has a receiver appointed for substantially all of its property. We may terminate the Everest license agreement if Everest Medicines, its affiliates or its sublicensees challenges the validity or enforceability of any of our patents covering any of the licensed compounds or products. In certain circumstances, if we materially breaches the Everest license agreement Everest Medicines may reduce royalties owed to us in lieu of a termination. Moreover, if we materially breaches the Everest license agreement and Everest Medicines terminates the Everest license agreement with respect to any jurisdiction and we then commercializes a licensed product in that jurisdiction, we will pay to Everest Medicines a low, single digit royalty on such sales of the licensed product in such jurisdiction for a minimum of five years after such termination.
 Research and Development Expenses
 For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $101.7 million, $63.8 million, and $73.8 million, respectively, in expenses on research and development activities.
 Competition
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. Many of our potential competitors have greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our potential competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our product candidates less competitive or obsolete.
 We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our most advanced product candidate, eravacycline, if approved, will be efficacy, coverage of drug-resistant strains of bacteria, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price, availability of reimbursement from governmental and other third-party payers and susceptibility to drug resistance.
 We are developing eravacycline as an IV antibiotic for use as a first-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of resistant and multidrug-resistant infections such as those found in patients with cIAI. If approved, eravacycline would compete with a number of currently marketed antibiotics, including meropenem, which is marketed by AstraZeneca as Merrem, imipenem/cilastatin, which is marketed by Merck & Co., or Merck, as Primaxin, tigecycline, which is marketed by Pfizer as Tygacil, piperacillin/tazobactam, which is marketed by Pfizer as Zosyn, ceftolozane/tazobactam, which is marketed by Merck as Zerbaxa, and ceftazidime/avibactam, which is marketed by Allergan, Inc., and AstraZeneca as Avycaz, meropenem and vaborbactam, which is marketed by Melinta Therapeutics as Vabomere, as well as several antibiotics currently in phase 3 development. We also expect that eravacycline, if approved, would compete with future and current generic versions of marketed antibiotics.
 If approved, we believe that eravacycline would compete effectively against these compounds on the basis of:
  
• | broad range of activity against a wide variety of resistant and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative, Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | lower probability of drug resistance;
--+--------------------------------------


• | a favorable safety and tolerability profile;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | a convenient dosing regimen;
--+-----------------------------


• | allows for monotherapy; and
--+----------------------------


• | no drug to drug interactions
--+-----------------------------

Recent Changes in the Regulatory Landscape
 The FDA’s Division of Anti-Infective Products, or DAIP, has undergone evolution in recent years, primarily driven by concerns that increasingly less effective antibiotics may have been approved in the last 10 to 15 years and a desire to bring what DAIP perceives to be greater statistical rigor to their analyses. The impact of this was a rethinking of how antibiotic efficacy is measured in clinical trials, and a review of the statistical tools used to analyze the data. In February 2015, the FDA published guidance documents for industry entitled “Complicated Urinary Tract Infections: Developing Drugs for Treatment” and guidance entitled “Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections: Developing Drugs for Treatment.” The purpose of these guidance documents was to address considerations surrounding the clinical development of drugs for cUTI and cIAI indications, including clinical trial design and efficacy considerations.
 On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed into law the 21st Centuries Cures Act, which builds on the FDA’s ongoing efforts to advance medical product innovation. One key component of this Act is the Limited Population pathway, which is designed to help streamline the development programs for certain antibacterials intended to treat targeted groups of patients suffering from serious or life-threatening infections where unmet need exists due to lack of available therapies. Approvals of these antimicrobials are expected to rely on data primarily targeting these limited populations. The statement “Limited Population” will appear prominently next to the drug’s name in labeling, which will provide notice to healthcare providers that the drug is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients. There is additional legislation pending in the U.S. Congress, including the DISARM Act, which would designate certain novel antibiotics used to treat serious bacterial infections to receive higher Medicare reimbursement, and an amendment to the GAIN Act, which would successful QIDP sponsors to transfer up to one year exclusivity to another product, including products marketed by other companies.
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, clinical trials, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, authorization, pharmacovigilance, adverse event reporting, recalls, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products and product candidates such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil and/or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 21


Preclinical Studies
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Preclinical tests intended for submission to the FDA to support the safety of a product candidate must be conducted in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act. A drug sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial along with the requirement to ensure that the data and results reported from the clinical trials are credible and accurate. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the criteria for determining subject eligibility, the dosing plan, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, the procedure for timely reporting of adverse events, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. During phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s or biological product’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid phase 2 clinical trials.
 Phase 2: The drug is administered to a larger, but still limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled and closely monitored.
 Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve a larger number of participants than a phase 2 clinical trial.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Results from one trial may not be predictive of results from subsequent trials. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Special Protocol Assessment
 The special protocol assessment, or SPA, process is designed to facilitate the FDA’s review and approval of drugs by allowing the FDA to evaluate the proposed design and size of phase 3 clinical trials that are intended to form the primary basis for determining a drug product’s efficacy. Generally, the trial must have already been discussed with the relevant FDA review division at an end-of-phase 2/pre-phase 3 meeting to be eligible for SPA review. Upon specific request by a clinical trial sponsor, the FDA will evaluate the protocol and respond to a sponsor’s questions regarding, among other things, primary efficacy endpoints, trial conduct and data analysis, within 45 days of receipt of the request.
 22


The FDA ultimately assesses whether the protocol design and planned analysis of the trial are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness of the indication studied. All agreements and disagreements between the FDA and the sponsor regarding an SPA must be clearly documented in an SPA letter or the minutes of a meeting between the sponsor and the FDA.
 Even if the FDA agrees to the design, execution and analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under the SPA process, the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement under the following circumstances:
  
• | public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, or the director of the review division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy has been identified after testing has begun;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a sponsor fails to follow a protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the relevant data, assumptions, or information provided by the sponsor in a request for SPA change are found to be false statements or misstatements, or are found to omit relevant facts.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A documented SPA may be modified, and such modification will be deemed binding on the FDA review division, except under the circumstances described above, if FDA and the sponsor agree in writing to modify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study.
 Marketing Approval
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. Furthermore, the FDA is not required to complete its review within the established ten-month timeframe and may extend the review process by issuing requests for additional information or clarification. The PDUFA goal date for the FDA to complete its review of our NDA is currently August 28, 2018.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. Our product candidates are not designated as orphan drugs.
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 23


Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 The FDA generally accepts data from foreign clinical trials in support of an NDA if the trials were conducted under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the FDA nevertheless may accept the data in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCPs and the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection, if deemed necessary. Although the FDA generally requests that marketing applications be supported by some data from domestic clinical studies, the FDA may accept foreign data as the sole basis for marketing approval if (1) the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, (2) the studies were performed by clinical investigators with recognized competence, and (3) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection or, if the FDA considers the inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means.
 The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
 To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need, or if the drug qualifies as a QIDP under the recently enacted GAIN Act. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides additional opportunities for interaction with the FDA’s review team and may allow for rolling review of NDA components before the completed application is submitted. The FDA granted eravacycline fast track designation as a QIDP in April 2014; granted fast track designation and as a QIDP for the IV formulation of TP-271 in September 2015 and for the oral formulation of TP-271 in February 2017. The FDA may decide to rescind the fast track designation if it determines that the qualifying criteria no longer apply. 
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment for a serious condition, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission.

In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, meaning that it may be approved on (1) the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or (2) on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
 Moreover, under the provisions of the new Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products that are placed on the market. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved, and approved drugs may generally be promoted only for their approved indications. Promotional claims must also be consistent with the product’s FDA-approved label, including claims related to safety and effectiveness. The FDA and other federal agencies also closely regulate the promotion of drugs in specific contexts such as direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and education activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
 25


Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences of regulatory non-compliance include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on, or suspensions of, the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | interruption of production processes, including the shutdown of manufacturing facilities or production lines or the imposition of new manufacturing requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or other enforcement letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products
 Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity
 Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the activity of the drug substance. We believe that eravacycline and our other product candidates are new chemical entities. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references the previously approved drug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. For drug products that contain an “antibiotic” ingredient approved prior to 1997, such as tetracycline, the statute imposes certain limitations on the award of non-patent exclusivity. However, we do not believe these limitations would apply to eravacycline or any of our other investigational antibiotics.
Qualified Infectious Disease Product Exclusivity
 Under the GAIN provisions of FDASIA, which was signed into law in July 2012, the FDA may designate a product as a “qualified infectious disease product,” or QIDP. In order to receive this designation, a drug must qualify as an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by either (1) an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens, or (2) a so-called “qualifying pathogen” found on a list of potentially dangerous, drug-resistant organisms to be established and maintained by the FDA under the new law. A sponsor must request such designation before submitting a marketing application. We obtained a QIDP designation for the IV formulation of eravacycline for cUTI and cIAI in July 2013, the oral formulation in March 2014, the IV formulation of TP-271 in September 2015, the oral formulation of TP-271 in February 2017, and expect to request QIDP designations for our other product candidates prior to submitting a marketing application for such product candidates, as appropriate.
 26


Upon approving an application for a qualified infectious disease product, the FDA will extend by an additional five years any non-patent marketing exclusivity period awarded, such as a five-year exclusivity period awarded for a new molecular entity. This extension is in addition to any pediatric exclusivity extension awarded, and the extension will be awarded only to a drug first approved on or after the date of enactment.
 The GAIN provisions prohibit the grant of an exclusivity extension where the application is a supplement to an application for which an extension is in effect or has expired, is a subsequent application for a specified change to an approved product, or is an application for a product that does not meet the definition of qualified infectious disease product based on the uses for which it is ultimately approved.
 Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the “reference” member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, such as government health programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and limiting the coverage and reimbursement amounts for medical products and services. 
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of the product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 In the U.S., the federal government provides health insurance for people who are 65 or older, and certain people with disabilities or certain conditions irrespective of their age, through the Medicare program, which is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS. Coverage and reimbursement for products and services under Medicare are determined in accordance with the Social Security Act and pursuant to regulations promulgated by CMS, as well as the agency’s subregulatory coverage and reimbursement guidance and determinations. 
 27


Medicaid is a health insurance program for low-income children, families, pregnant women, and people with disabilities that is jointly funded by the federal and state governments, but administered by the states. In general, state Medicaid programs are required to cover drugs and biologicals of manufacturers that have entered into a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement, although such drugs and biologicals may be subject to prior authorization or other utilization controls.
 The U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. Recently, a number of legislative reform measures have been passed to contain healthcare reimbursement for pharmaceuticals, including drugs such as our product candidates. For example, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, known collectively as ACA, among other things, establishes annual fees to be paid by manufacturers for certain branded prescription drugs, requires manufacturers to participate in a discount program for certain outpatient drugs under Medicare Part D, increases manufacturer rebate liabilities under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for outpatient drugs dispensed to Medicaid recipients, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are line extensions of current drugs, and expands oversight and support for the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research of services and products. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. We cannot predict the full impact of ACA or future reform measures on our operations.
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, in the EU, the sole legal instrument at the EU level governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products is Council Directive 89/105/EEC, or the Price Transparency Directive. The aim of this Directive is to ensure that pricing and reimbursement mechanisms established in the EU Member States are transparent and objective, do not hinder the free movement of and trade in medicinal products in the EU, and do not hinder, prevent or distort competition on the market. The Price Transparency Directive does not provide any guidance concerning the specific criteria on the basis of which pricing and reimbursement decisions are to be made in individual EU Member States, nor does it have any direct consequence for pricing or reimbursement levels in individual EU Member States. The EU Member States are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, and to control the prices and/or reimbursement levels of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the medicinal product, or alternatively adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company responsible for placing the medicinal product on the market, including volume-based arrangements, caps and reference pricing mechanisms.
 Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden. The HTA process in the EU Member States is governed by the national laws of these countries. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact, and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product vary between EU Member States. A negative HTA of one of our products by a leading and recognized HTA body, such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom, could not only undermine our ability to obtain reimbursement for such product in the EU Member State in which such negative assessment was issued, but also in other EU Member States. For example, EU Member States that have not yet developed HTA mechanisms could rely to some extent on the HTA performed in countries with a developed HTA framework, such as the United Kingdom, when adopting decisions concerning the pricing and reimbursement of a specific medicinal product.
 Other Healthcare Laws
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, if our drug candidates are approved and we begin commercialization, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
