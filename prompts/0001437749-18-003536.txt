--------+---------

General
 
USA Truck is one of the nation’s top 30 truckload carriers when measured by operating revenue, as determined by Transport Topics’ most recent annual ranking. In 2017, the Company generated $446.5 million in consolidated operating revenue. As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s fleet consisted of 1,669 tractors, which included 247 independent contractor tractors, and 5,596 trailers.
 
USA Truck is headquartered in Van Buren, Arkansas, with trucking facilities concentrated in the eastern half of the United States for density and efficiency. Asset-light operations provide services across North America. The Company transports commodities throughout the contiguous United States and into and out of portions of Canada. USA Truck also transports general commodities into and out of Mexico by offering through-trailer service from its terminal in Laredo, Texas. In addition to truckload and dedicated freight service offerings, the Company provides freight brokerage, logistics, and rail intermodal service offerings through its logistics segment. 
 
The Company has two reportable segments: (i) Trucking, consisting of the Company’s truckload and dedicated freight service offerings, and (ii) USAT Logistics, consisting of the Company’s freight brokerage and rail intermodal service offerings. The Company’s Trucking segment transports customer freight over irregular routes utilizing equipment owned by either the Company or independent contractors as a medium to long-haul common carrier. Our dedicated freight services provide similar freight transport services, but do so pursuant to agreements whereby the Company makes equipment available to a specific customer for shipments over particular routes at specified times, typically over a multi-year period. USAT Logistics provides services which complement USA Truck’s Trucking services. For 2017, USAT Logistics represented approximately 32% of USA Truck’s consolidated operating revenue, up from approximately 30% during both 2016 and 2015, and we expect to continue to grow this segment. Financial information regarding these segments and assets and revenues relating to foreign operations is provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
 
Operations 
 
The Company focuses marketing efforts on customers who have consistent shipping needs within USA Truck’s primary operating areas, which are predominantly located in the eastern half of the United States. This focused operating area for Trucking, nationwide service for USAT Logistics, and cross-marketing of service offerings permits the strategic positioning of available equipment and allows the Company to provide its customers with a full array of supply chain transportation solutions. More than 95 of the Company’s top 100 customers utilized more than one of the Company’s service offering in 2017. In addition, USA Truck team members have cultivated a thorough understanding of the needs of shippers in key industries. The Company believes this helps it develop long-term, service-oriented relationships with its customers.

USA Truck has a diversified freight and customer base. During 2017, one customer, Walmart Inc., accounted for more than 10% of the consolidated operating revenues. USAT Logistics is also dependent upon a single customer for more than 10% of their operating revenue. The Company’s largest 10 customers comprised approximately 44% of the Company’s consolidated operating revenue. Overall, the Company provided service to more than 900 customers in 2017 across all USA Truck service offerings.
 
While the Company prefers direct relationships with customers, some high volume shippers require their carriers to conduct business with a designated third party logistics provider. Obtaining shipments through other providers of transportation or logistics services is a significant opportunity that allows the Company to provide services for high-volume shippers to which it might not otherwise have access.
 
During 2017, receivables collection averaged approximately 46 days from the invoice date, compared to an average of approximately 47 days and 38 days during 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Factors contributing to the slight decrease in days to collection in 2017 were the result of more thorough invoicing and collections processes being implemented by our accounts receivable team, offset by customers continuing to push for longer payment terms.
 
While the Company primarily operates in the eastern half of the United States, it does provide services into and out of Mexico and Canada.  During 2017, 2016 and 2015 approximately 8%, 9% and 8%, respectively, of the Company’s operating revenue was generated in Mexico and Canada.  All foreign revenue is collected in United States dollars, and all Company-owned tractors are domiciled in the United States. The Company does not separately track domestic and foreign long-lived assets, as substantially all of the Company’s long-lived assets are, and have been for the last three fiscal years, located within the United States.
 
The Company’s Trucking segment is supported primarily by driver managers, load planners and customer service representatives. These teams monitor the location of equipment and direct its movement in a safe, efficient and practicable manner. Each driver manager leads a team of professional drivers and is their primary company contact. Load planners assign all available units to loads in a manner intended to maximize profit and minimize costs. Customer service representatives work to fulfill shippers’ needs, solicit freight, and ensure on-time delivery by monitoring load movement. The Company strives to operate a safe and productive fleet while achieving superior customer service.
The USAT Logistics segment has a network of both regional and national sales offices located throughout the continental United States as well as an office in central Mexico. We believe that regionalization allows greater market insight and strengthens relationships with customers and carriers alike while capitalizing on the skills of the leaders managing these centers. The specific locations of branch offices are selected for the availability of talent in those markets. USAT Logistics employed approximately 100 people as of December 31, 2017. Most of the USAT Logistics team interacts directly with customers and carriers, matching customers’ freight needs with available third-party capacity in the marketplace.

Revenue Equipment 
 
The Company operates its tractor fleet in a way that is intended to promote safe driving operations, attract drivers, and reduce operating and maintenance costs. The following table shows the number of Company-owned and leased tractors and trailers by model year as of December 31, 2017:
 

Model Year: | Tractors(1)(2) | | Trailers
-----------------+----------------+-------+---------
2018 | | 40 | | 399 
2017 | | 310 | | 844

(1) | Excludes 247 independent contractor tractors.
----+----------------------------------------------


(2) | Includes 508 tractors financed by operating leases and 675 tractors financed by capital leases.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The average age of the Company’s tractor fleet was approximately 3.0 years at December 31, 2017. The Company’s equipment purchase and replacement decisions are based on a number of factors, including but not limited to, new equipment prices, the used equipment market, trade-in values, demand for freight services, prevailing interest rates, the attractiveness of lease terms, technological improvements, regulatory changes, cost per mile, fuel efficiency, equipment durability, equipment specifications and driver comfort. Therefore, depending on the circumstances, the Company may accelerate or delay the acquisition and disposition of its tractors or trailers from time to time, or may choose to acquire revenue equipment through operating leases or on-balance sheet financing.
 
To simplify driver and mechanic training, control the cost of spare parts and tire inventory, and provide for a more efficient vehicle maintenance program, the Company purchases tractors and trailers manufactured to its specifications. The Company has in place a preventive maintenance program intended to minimize equipment downtime and maintenance costs. 
 
The Company finances the purchase of revenue equipment through its cash flows from operations, revolving credit agreement, capital lease arrangements, operating lease arrangements and proceeds from sales or trades of used equipment. Substantially all of the Company’s tractors and trailers are pledged to secure its obligations under financing arrangements.
 
All Company and independent contractor tractors are equipped with in-cab communication technology, enabling two-way communications between the Company and its drivers, through both standardized and freeform messaging, including electronic logging. The Company also has installed automatic on board recording devices (“AOBRs”) on 100% of its tractor fleet. This technology enables USA Truck to dispatch drivers efficiently in response to customers’ requests, to provide real-time information to customers about the status of their shipments and to provide documentation supporting accessorial charges. Accessorial charges are charges to customers for additional services such as loading, unloading and detainment or equipment delays. In addition, the Company utilizes satellite-based equipment tracking devices and cargo sensors on the majority of its trailers. These tracking devices provide the Company with visibility on the locations and load status of its trailers. The Company also anticipates completing the installation of forward-facing and in-ward facing event recorders on all of the Company’s tractor fleet in the first quarter of 2018. 
 
Safety and Risk Management
 
The Company emphasizes safe work habits as a core value throughout the entire organization, and provides proactive training and education relating to safety concepts, processes and procedures. The Company conducts pre-employment, random, reasonable suspicion and post-accident alcohol and substance abuse testing in accordance with the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) regulations and the Company’s own policies.

Safety training for new drivers begins in orientation, when newly hired team members are taught safe driving and work techniques that emphasize the Company’s commitment to safety. Upon completion of orientation, new student drivers are required to undergo on-the-road training for four to six weeks with experienced commercial motor vehicle drivers who have been selected for their professionalism and commitment to safety and who are trained to communicate safe driving techniques to new drivers. New drivers who graduate from the program must also successfully complete post-training classroom and road testing before being assigned to their own tractor. Additionally, all Company drivers participate in on-going training that focuses on collision and injury prevention, among other safety concepts.
 
The primary risks for which the Company is insured are cargo loss and damage, general liability, personal injury, property damage, workers’ compensation and employee medical expenses. USA Truck is also self-insured for a portion of claims exposure in each of these areas. The Company’s self-insurance retention levels are $0.5 million for workers’ compensation claims per occurrence, $0.05 million for cargo loss and damage claims per occurrence and $1.0 million for bodily injury and property damage claims per occurrence. For medical benefits, the Company self-insures up to $0.25 million per plan participant per year with an aggregate claim exposure limit determined by the Company’s year-to-date claims experience and its number of covered team members. The Company maintains insurance above the amounts for which it self-insures, subject to certain limits, with licensed insurance carriers. The Company has excess general, auto and employer’s liability coverage in amounts substantially exceeding minimum legal requirements.  The Company is completely self-insured for physical damage to its own tractors and trailers, except that the Company carries catastrophic physical damage coverage to protect against natural disasters.
 
Although the Company believes the aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims, it is possible that one or more claims could exceed the Company’s aggregate coverage limits. An unexpected loss or changing conditions in the insurance market could adversely affect premium levels or result in our inability to find excess coverage in amounts we deem sufficient. As a result, the Company’s insurance and claims expense could increase, or USA Truck could raise its self-insured retention or decrease the Company’s aggregate coverage limits when its policies are renewed or replaced. If these costs increase, if reserves are increased, if we become unable to find excess coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, if claims in excess of coverage limits are experienced, or if a claim is experienced where coverage is not provided, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition in any one quarter or annual period could be materially and adversely affected. 
Team Members

As of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 2,000 team members, of which approximately 72% were Company drivers. No team members are subject to union contracts or part of a collective bargaining unit. The Company believes team member relations to be good.
Recruitment, training, and retention of a professional driver workforce, the Company’s most valuable asset, are essential to the Company’s continued growth and fulfillment of customer needs. USA Truck hires qualified professional drivers who hold a valid commercial driver’s license, satisfy applicable federal and state safety performance and measurement requirements, and meet USA Truck’s hiring criteria. These guidelines relate primarily to safety history, road test evaluations, and various other evaluations, which include physical examinations and mandatory drug and alcohol testing. In order to attract and retain safe drivers who are committed to customer service and safety, the Company focuses its operations for drivers around a collaborative and supportive team environment. The Company provides comfortable, late model equipment, direct communication with senior management, competitive wages and benefits, and other incentives intended to encourage driver safety, retention, and long-term employment. The Company values its relationship with its drivers and structures its driver retention model with a focus on a long-term career with USA Truck. Drivers are compensated on a per mile basis, based on the length of haul and a predetermined number of miles. Drivers are also compensated for accessorial services provided to customers. Drivers and other employees are encouraged to participate in the Company’s 401(k) program, and Company-sponsored health, life, and dental plans. The Company believes these factors help in attracting, recruiting, and retaining professional drivers in a competitive driver market. 
Independent Contractors
 
In addition to Company drivers, USA Truck enters into contracts with independent contractors, who provide a tractor and a driver and are responsible for all operating expenses in exchange for an agreed upon fee structure. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had contracts with 247 independent contractors, which comprises approximately 16% of the professional driving fleet. In the near term, the Company’s goal is for independent contractors to comprise approximately 15% to 25% of its fleet.

Competition
 
The trucking industry includes both private fleets and for-hire carriers. Private fleets consist of trucks owned and operated by shippers that move their own goods. For-hire carriers include both truckload and Less-than-Truckload operations. The for-hire segment is highly competitive and includes thousands of carriers, none of which controls a meaningful share of the market. This segment is characterized by many small carriers having revenues of less than $1 million per year and as few as one truck, and relatively few carriers with revenues exceeding $100 million per year. 
 
USA Truck competes primarily with other truckload carriers, private fleets and, to a lesser extent, railroads and Less-than-Truckload carriers. The principal competitive factors in the truckload segment of the industry are service and price, with rate discounting becoming particularly important during economic downturns or periods of uncertainty. USA Truck’s focus is to differentiate itself primarily on the basis of service rather than rates. Although an increase in the size of the market would benefit all truckload carriers, management believes that successful carriers are likely to grow market share by providing multiple service offerings, combined with superior customer service, at an equitable price.
 
Environmental Regulation 
 
In August 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) adopted final rules that established the first-ever fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, including the tractors the Company employs (the “Phase 1 Standards”).  The Phase 1 Standards apply to tractor model years 2014 to 2018 and require the achievement of an approximate 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption by the 2018 model year, which equates to approximately four fewer gallons of fuel used for every 100 miles traveled.  In addition, in February 2014, President Obama announced that his administration would begin developing the next phase of tighter fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards for medium and heavy-duty tractors and trailers (the “Phase 2 Standards”).  In October 2016, the EPA and NHTSA published the final rule mandating that the Phase 2 Standards will apply to trailers beginning with model year 2018 and tractors beginning with model year 2021.  The Phase 2 Standards require nine percent and 25 percent reductions in emissions and fuel consumption for trailers and tractors, respectively, by 2027.  The Company believes these requirements could result in increased new tractor and trailer prices and additional parts and maintenance costs required to retrofit its tractors and trailers with technology to achieve compliance with such standards, which could adversely affect its operating results and profitability, particularly if such costs are not offset by potential fuel savings. The Company cannot predict, however, the extent to which its operations and productivity will be impacted. In October 2017, the EPA announced a proposal to repeal the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to gliders (which mix refurbished older components, including transmissions and pre-emission-rule engines, with a new frame, cab, steer axle, wheels, and other standard equipment). Additionally, implementation of the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to trailers has been delayed due to a provisional stay granted in October 2017 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which is overseeing a case against the EPA by the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association, Inc. regarding the Phase 2 Standards. If the trailer provisions of the Phase 2 Standards are permanently removed, the Company expects that Phase 2 Standards would have a reduced effect on its operations. 
 
The California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) also adopted emission control regulations that will apply to all heavy-duty tractors that pull 53-foot or longer box-type trailers within the State of California.  The tractors and trailers subject to these CARB regulations must be either EPA SmartWay certified or equipped with low-rolling resistance tires and retrofitted with SmartWay-approved aerodynamic technologies.  The Company currently purchases SmartWay certified equipment in its new tractor and trailer acquisitions. In addition, in February 2017 CARB proposed California phase 2 standards that generally align with the federal standards which apply to model year 2018 to 2021 tractors, with some minor additional requirements, and as proposed would stay in place even if the federal standards are affected by action from President Trump’s administration.  CARB has announced it plans to bring a formal proposal to its Board in early 2018.  We will continue monitoring our compliance with the CARB regulations.  Federal and state lawmakers also have proposed potential limits on carbon emissions under a variety of climate-change proposals.  Compliance with such regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors, may increase the cost of any new trailers that we will operate in California, may require us to retrofit certain of our pre-2011 model year trailers that operate in California, and could impair equipment productivity and increase our operating expenses, including with respect to our Plus Power fleet.  These adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values of these vehicles, could materially increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations.

In order to reduce exhaust emissions, some states and municipalities have begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel-powered tractors may idle. These restrictions could force the Company to purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle or to alter its drivers' behavior, which could result in a decrease in productivity, or increase in driver turnover.
 
The Company’s terminals often are located in industrial areas where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination may have occurred or could occur. The Company’s operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. Certain of the Company’s facilities have waste oil or fuel storage tanks and fueling islands and one leased facility has below-ground bulk fuel storage tanks. A small percentage of the Company’s freight consists of low-grade hazardous substances, which subjects it to a wide array of regulations. The Company has instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations; however, if (i) the Company is involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances; (ii) there are releases of hazardous substances the Company transports; (iii) soil or groundwater contamination is found at the Company’s facilities or results from its operations; or (iv) the Company is found to be in violation of or fails to comply with applicable environmental laws or regulations, then it could be subject to clean-up costs and liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.
Other Regulation 
 
The Company’s operations are regulated and licensed by various United States federal and state, Canadian provincial, and Mexican federal agencies. Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the DOT. Matters such as weight and equipment dimensions are also subject to United States federal and state regulation and Canadian provincial regulations. The Company operates in the United States pursuant to operating authority granted by the DOT, in various Canadian provinces pursuant to operating authority granted by the Ministries of Transportation and Communications in such provinces, and within Mexico pursuant to operating authority granted by Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes. To the extent that the Company conducts operations outside the United States, it is subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits United States companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining favorable treatment.

The DOT, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (the “FMCSA”), imposes safety and fitness regulations on the Company and its drivers, including rules that restrict driver hours-of-service. Changes to such hours-of-service rules can negatively impact the Company’s productivity and affect its operations and profitability by reducing the number of hours per day or week its drivers may operate and/or disrupting its network. While the FMCSA has proposed and implemented such changes in the past, no such changes are currently proposed. However, any future changes to hours-of-service rules could materially and adversely affect the Company’s operations and profitability.
 
There are two methods of evaluating the safety and fitness of carriers. The first method is the application of a safety rating that is based on an onsite investigation and affects a carrier’s ability to operate in interstate commerce. The Company currently has a satisfactory DOT safety rating under this method, which is the highest available rating under the current safety rating scale. If the Company were to receive a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could adversely affect the Company’s business, as some of its existing customer contracts require a satisfactory DOT safety rating. In January 2016, the FMCSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking outlining a revised safety rating measurement system, which would replace the current methodology.  Under the proposed rule, the current three safety ratings of “satisfactory,” “conditional,” and “unsatisfactory” would be replaced with a single safety rating of “unfit,” and a carrier would be deemed fit when no rating was assigned.  Moreover, the proposed rules would use roadside inspection data, in addition to investigations and onsite reviews, to determine a carrier’s safety fitness on a monthly basis.  Under the current rules, a safety rating can only be given upon completion of a comprehensive onsite audit or review.  The proposed rule underwent a public comment period that ended in June 2016 and several industry groups and lawmakers expressed their disagreement with the proposed rule, arguing that it violates the requirements of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (the “FAST Act”) and that the FMCSA must first finalize its review of the CSA scoring system, described in further detail below. Based on this feedback and other concerns raised by industry stakeholders, in March 2017, the FMCSA withdrew the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking related to the new safety rating system. In its notice of withdrawal, the FMCSA noted that a new rulemaking related to a similar process may be initiated in the future. Therefore, it is uncertain if, when, or under what form any such rule could be implemented.

In addition to the safety rating system, the FMCSA has adopted the Compliance Safety Accountability (“CSA”) program as an additional safety enforcement and compliance model that evaluates and ranks fleets on certain safety-related standards. The CSA program analyzes data from roadside inspections, moving violations, crash reports from the last two years, and investigation results. The data is organized into seven categories. Carriers are grouped by category with other carriers that have a similar number of safety events (e.g., crashes, inspections, or violations) and carriers are ranked and assigned a rating percentile to prioritize them for interventions if they are above a certain threshold. Currently, these scores do not have a direct impact on a carrier’s safety rating. However, the occurrence of unfavorable scores in one or more categories may (i) affect driver recruiting and retention by causing high-quality drivers to seek employment with other carriers, (ii) cause the Company’s customers to direct their business away from the Company and to carriers with higher fleet rankings (iii), subject the Company to an increase in compliance reviews and roadside inspections, or (iv) cause the Company to incur greater than expected expenses in its attempts to improve unfavorable scores, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and profitability.
 
Under CSA, these scores were initially made available to the public in five of the seven categories.  However, pursuant to the FAST Act, which was signed into law in December 2015, the FMCSA was required to remove from public view the previously available CSA scores while it reviews the reliability of the scoring system.  During this period of review by the FMCSA, the Company will continue to have access to its scores and will still be subject to intervention by the FMCSA when such scores are above the intervention thresholds. A congressionally mandated report by the national Academies of Science related to the CSA program was released in June 2017 which recommended: (i) reconfiguring the underlying statistical model under CSA’s Safety Measurement System (the percentile ranking categories used to target carriers for intervention) with a so-called item response theory model to more accurately target at-risk carriers, (ii) making the scoring system more transparent and easier for carriers to replicate and understand, and (iii) departing from using relative metrics as the sole means for targeting carriers. The FMCSA is expected to provide a report to Congress in early 2018 outlining the changes it will make to the CSA program in response to the report. It is unclear if, when, and to what extent any such changes will occur. However, any changes that increase the likelihood of us receiving unfavorable scores could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability. The Company will continue to monitor the FMCSA’s response and future proposed rules that may affect the scoring methodology in order to continue to promote improvement of scores in all seven categories with ongoing reviews of all safety-related policies, programs and procedures for their effectiveness.
 
We have on certain occasions exceeded the established intervention thresholds in a number of the seven CSA safety-related categories.  Based on these unfavorable ratings, we may be prioritized for an intervention action or roadside inspection, either of which could have a material adverse effect our results of operations.  In addition, customers may be less likely to assign loads to us.  We have put procedures in place in an attempt to address areas where we have exceeded the thresholds.  However, we cannot guarantee these measures will be effective.
 
In 2015, the FMCSA issued final rules requiring nearly all carriers, including the Company, to install and use electronic logging devices (“ELDs”) in their tractors starting in December 2017, in order to electronically monitor truck miles and enforce hours-of-service. Enforcement of this rule will be phased in, as states will not begin putting tractors out of service for non-compliance until April 1, 2018. However, carriers are subject to citations, on a state-by-state basis, for non-compliance with the rule after the December 2017 compliance deadline. Prior to the December 2017 deadline, the Company installed AOBRs on 100% of its tractor fleet, which has exempted us from being 100% ELD compliant on our tractor fleet until December 2019. The Company expects to be compliant with ELDs on 100% of all required vehicles prior to the December 2019 deadline. 
 
In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, federal, state and municipal authorities implemented and continue to implement various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. The Transportation Security Administration (the “TSA”) has adopted regulations that require determination by the TSA that each driver who applies for or renews his license for carrying hazardous materials is not a security threat.
 
In November 2015, the FMCSA published its final rule related to driver coercion, which took effect in January 2016. Under this rule, carriers, shippers, receivers, or transportation intermediaries that are found to have coerced drivers to violate certain FMCSA regulations (including hours-of-service rules) may be fined up to $16,000 for each offense.

In December 2016, FMCSA and DOT published the Commercial Driver’s License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse rule as mandated by the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act. The rule establishes and mandates a query to the Clearinghouse by employers and prospective employers to determine if current or prospective drivers have had any drug/alcohol positives or refusals. The rule went into effect in January 2017 and mandates compliance by January 2020 to allow time for the design and implementation of the clearinghouse IT systems. When compliance becomes mandatory, it could result in a decrease in driver availability and adversely affect the Company’s operations. 
 
Other rules have been recently proposed or made final by the FMCSA, including (i) a rule requiring the use of speed limiting devices on heavy duty tractors to restrict maximum speeds, which was proposed in 2016, and (ii) a rule setting forth minimum driver training standards for new drivers applying for commercial driver’s licenses for the first time and to experienced drivers upgrading their licenses or seeking a hazardous materials endorsement, which was made final in December 2016, with a compliance date in February 2020. In July 2017, the DOT announced that it would no longer pursue a speed limiter rule, but left open the possibility that it could resume such a pursuit in the future. The effect of these rules, to the extent they become effective, could result in a decrease in fleet production and driver availability, either of which could adversely affect the Company’s business or operations.
 
Tax and other regulatory authorities have in the past sought to assert that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors.  Federal legislators continue to introduce legislation concerning the classification of independent contractors as employees, including legislation that proposes to increase the tax and labor penalties against employers who intentionally or unintentionally misclassify employees as independent contractors and are found to have violated employees' overtime or wage requirements.  Additionally, federal legislators have sought to (i) abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice, (ii) extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to independent contractors, and (iii) impose notice requirements based upon employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply.  Some states have adopted initiatives to increase their revenues from items such as unemployment, workers' compensation, and income taxes, and the Company believes a reclassification of independent contractor drivers as employees would help states with this initiative.  Federal and state taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. Further, class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against certain members of our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractors as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers’ compensation and health care coverage. In addition, companies that employ lease-purchase independent contractor programs, such as us, have been more susceptible to reclassification lawsuits and several recent decisions have been made in favor of those seeking to classify independent contractor truck drivers as employees. If the independent contractors the Company engages were determined to be its employees, it would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort laws, which could potentially include prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.  The Company currently observes and monitors its compliance with current related and applicable laws and regulations, but it cannot predict whether laws and regulations adopted in the future regarding the classification of the independent contractor drivers it engages will adversely affect the Company’s business or operations.
 
The regulatory environment has changed under the administration of President Trump.  In January 2017, the President signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to repeal two regulations for each new one they propose and imposing a regulatory budget, which would limit the amount of new regulatory costs federal agencies can impose on individuals and businesses each year. The Company does not believe the order has had a significant impact on its industry. However, the order, and other anti-regulatory action by the President and/or Congress, may inhibit future new regulations and/or lead to the repeal or delayed effectiveness of existing regulations. Therefore, it is uncertain how the Company may be impacted in the future by existing, proposed, or repealed regulations. 
 
For further discussion regarding such laws and regulations, refer to the “Risk Factors” section under Part 1, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Seasonality
 
In the trucking industry, revenue has historically followed a seasonal pattern for various commodities and customer businesses. Peak freight demand has historically occurred in the months of September, October and November. After the December holiday season and during the remaining winter months, freight volumes are typically lower as many customers reduce shipment levels. Operating expenses have historically been higher in the winter months due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency, increased cold weather-related maintenance costs of revenue equipment and increased insurance and claims costs attributed to adverse winter weather conditions. Revenue can also be impacted by weather, holidays and the number of business days that occur during a given period, as revenue is directly related to the available working days of shippers.
