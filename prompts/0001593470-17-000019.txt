Item 1. Business
Overview of Our Business
 
Tiger Reef, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on June 27, 2013 under the name Stream Flow Media, Inc. The Company amended its Articles of Incorporation on October 14, 2015 to change its name to Blue Water Bar & Grill, Inc. and further amended its Articles of Incorporation on October 24, 2016 to change its name to Tiger Reef, Inc. Tiger Reef is a diversified producer of ultra premium rums under the Tiger Reef® brand and a developer of Caribbean casual dining restaurant properties under the Mermaid Reef Ocean Grill & Lounge™ brand.
Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We are an "emerging growth company", as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.
 
Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. Tiger Reef has elected not to opt out of the transition period pursuant to Section 107(b).
 
We could remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.
 
Notwithstanding the above, we are also currently a “smaller reporting company”, meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still considered a “smaller reporting company”, at such time are we cease being an “emerging growth company”, the disclosure we will be required to provide in our SEC filings will increase, but will still be 
 4
 

less than it would be if we were not considered either an “emerging growth company” or a “smaller reporting company”. Specifically, similar to “emerging growth companies”, “smaller reporting companies” are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as an “emerging growth company” or “smaller reporting company” may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.
 
Therefore, an investment in our business is considered extremely risky and is suitable only for those who can afford to lose their entire investment.
 
Plan of Operation
 
Tiger Reef was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on June 27, 2013 under the name Stream Flow Media, Inc. We amended our Articles of Incorporation on October 14, 2015 to change our name to Blue Water Bar & Grill, Inc. and further amended its Articles of Incorporation on October 24, 2016 to change its name to Tiger Reef, Inc. Tiger Reef is a diversified producer of ultra premium rums under the Tiger Reef® brand and a developer of casual dining restaurant properties in the Caribbean under the Mermaid Reef Ocean Grill & Lounge™ brand.
 
The projected costs and other related expenses are estimates made by our management and our actual costs related to opening our proposed restaurants may differ significantly.
 
In addition to the foregoing, and unless otherwise noted, all of the cost estimates and forecasts throughout our business plan are mere estimates made by our management. Our actual costs related to opening and operating the proposed restaurants may differ significantly from our estimates, which could have a negative impact on our overall business, cause our business to fail, and result in you losing all of your investment.
 
Tiger Reef® Ultra Premium Rums
 
Tiger Reef has worked closely with a distinguished and multi-award winning Cuban Maestro Ronero (master rum maker) to formulate three new and very special ultra premium rums specifically for the US market.  These rums will be produced and bottled in the Dominican Republic and are expected to be available to US consumers as early as Fall 2017.
Mermaid Reef Ocean Grill & Lounge™
 
The Mermaid Reef Ocean Grill & Lounge (“Mermaid Reef”) concept is an intimate restaurant of between 60 to 80 seats, with both indoor and outdoor seating, featuring a variety of proteins, both from the ocean and the land, seasonal crispy vegetables, and an array of rich, delectable sauces to please even the most discriminating palette. Each restaurant will be built on-site at an existing major Caribbean resort chain and, even though it will be operated as a resort amenity, each restaurant will also be actively marketed to non-resort guests and local residents.
 
Tiger Reef is currently in advanced negotiations for a leased restaurant space on the island of St. Maarten, Dutch West Indies to open the first Mermaid Reef. Tiger Reef anticipates these discussions will result in an executed lease agreement sometime in early Q2 2017. Updates on these material discussions and the Caribbean restaurant concept will be provided to shareholders once finalized. 
 
Keys for Success
 
To better achieve our business objectives and successfully compete with other restaurants, we have developed the following focal points and strategies we anticipate implementing in all of our future restaurants:
 
Create a Fun, Energetic, Destination Drinking and Dining Experience. We wish to create and promote a fun and socially open atmosphere whereby our customers can, if they choose to do so, openly interact with one another. Topics of discussion and frequent interest will often center around where each other is from, what activities have they done while on the island, and giving and receiving recommendations for future activities while on the island; sometimes the floor and bar staff will participate in these discussions and offer their own words of advice. We intend to accomplish this by utilizing sectional floor and foot traffic planning, whereby the bar area will promote social interaction among customers, a stage area will feature local live entertainment performers to create a lively and festive atmosphere, and more intimate dining tables will be located further in 
 5
 

the back to provide separation for those who just wish to dine alone and enjoy the island atmosphere. We believe that if we are successful at achieving this goal, new customers – tourists, “local” ex-patriots and native locals alike – will become repeat, or “regular”, customers and subsequently promote the restaurant by word-of-mouth to their friends and family.
 
Distinctive Concept. In each restaurant we wish to create a fun and consistent experience for our customers centered around our full bar service, dining offerings, and daily entertainment. The restaurant’s concept will be carried throughout our customers’ entire visit and will involve all aspects of the experience, including the exterior design of the building, interior layout and decorum, employee greetings and uniforms, specialty drinks and menu items, and fun and creative souvenirs such as interestingly shaped drink glasses and bright and flamboyant t-shirts that can remind the customer of their vacation or make an excellent gift for someone back home.
 
Comfortable Adult Atmosphere. Our restaurants will be primarily adult orientated. While children will be welcomed during daytime hours as long as they are accompanied by a responsible adult at all times during their visit, no one under 21 years of age (or the minimum legal drinking age as established by statute) will be allowed into our restaurants after 10pm. We believe that this policy will help maintain a fun and relaxed atmosphere that appeals to adult customers, and will help attract groups such as private parties and business organizations.
 
High Standard of Customer Service. Because service is one the key areas restaurants differentiate themselves from one another – and a constant source of either compliments or complaints from customers – we intend to foster a high level of customer service among our employees, ranging from the general manager to the greeters, through intense training (cross training for all manager level employees and a one-week training course, complete with required testing on all food and drink offerings, operational procedures, and computer checkout for all other employees), constant monitoring (from the on-duty manager and surprise visits from “secret shoppers”), and emphasizing consideration of our customers first and foremost in all decisions. From the moment a customer walks into the front door, we want them to experience a high level of guest service provided by a knowledgeable, energetic staff. Bar tenders will be required to be able to free pour simultaneously from multiple liquor bottles and perform “flare” techniques (flipping, tossing, and twirling of liquor bottles) for our customers’ entertainment; greeters and servers will be required to introduce customers to the concept, explain the drink and entree menus and daily specials, and generally set the stage for a fun and memorable experience for them.
 
Provide Dining Value. We believe that our restaurants should provide our customers with interesting, high quality, and generously portioned (covering the entire plate) menu items that are aesthetically appealing and result in the customer leaving fully satisfied. Complementing the dining aspect, we intend to offer the customer a unique variety of original drinks, each designed to perpetuate and immerse the customer in the restaurant’s overall concept. It is our goal to generate at least a US$35 average check per guest, inclusive of food and drinks. We estimate that our overall gross sales will be comprised of 65% food and 35% drinks. We anticipate achieving and maintaining a 30% food cost and 18% liquor cost, which relates to our actual cost of the product compared to the gross revenue the product generates. For example, if we sold a fish entree for $20 our actual cost would be $6 and our gross profit would be $14. Prices for entrees will start at around $12 for a hamburger and rise to $42 (or more) for a surf and turf dinner; prices for drinks will start at $3 for beer, $6 for basic well mixed drinks, and $8 for specialty drinks.
 
It is important to note that although we aspire to operate at or below the above food and liquor costs, we cannot guarantee that we will ever achieve such food or liquor costs or, if achieved, will be able to maintain them.
 
Operations and Management
 
Our ability to effectively manage an operation including high volume restaurants (annual gross sales of US$1,000,000 or more) with live entertainment offerings is critical to our overall success. In order to maintain quality and consistency at each of our future restaurants we must carefully train and properly supervise our personnel and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to personnel performance, food and beverage preparation, entertainment productions and equipment, and maintenance of the restaurant facilities. We believe our current management is capable of overseeing our planned growth over the next two years. While staffing levels will vary from restaurant to restaurant depending on actual sales volumes, we anticipate our typical restaurant management staff to be comprised of a general manager, a kitchen manager (who also serves as the head chef) and a bar manager (who also serves as the head bartender); the kitchen manager and bar manager will also act as assistant general managers when the general manager is off-duty and will receive a slightly higher base salary compared to our other chefs and bartenders to compensate for their added responsibilities.
 
Recruiting. We will actively recruit and select individuals who share our passion for customer service. Our selection process includes testing and multiple interviews to aid in the selection of new employees, regardless of their prospective position. We will offer a competitive compensation plan to our managers that includes a base salary, bonuses for achieving performance 
 6
 

objectives, and possibly incentive stock options once they have worked for us for at least one full year. For example, the general manager in our initial restaurant will most likely be offered a base salary of $3,500 a month, plus up to $1,000 a month in additional performance incentives for achieving minimum gross sales and exceeding the minimum targeted food, liquor, and labor costs, as determined by our executive management team. In addition, all employees are entitled to discount meals at any of our future restaurants.
 
Training. We believe that proper training is the key to exceptional customer service. Each new management hire will go through an extensive training program, which will include cross-training in all management duties. All non-management new hires will go through a standard training program where they will learn and be tested on all of our food and drink offerings, operational procedures, and our point-of-sale (POS) computer system.
 
Management Information Systems (MIS). All of our future restaurants will be equipped with a variety of integrated management information systems. These systems will include an easy-to-use point-of-sale (POS) computer system which facilitates the movement of customer food and drink orders between the customer areas and kitchen and bar operations, controls cash, handles credit card authorizations, keeps track of sales on a per employee basis for incentive awards purposes, and provides on-site and executive level management with real-time sales and inventory data. Additionally, we intend to implement a centralized accounting system that will include a food cost program and a labor scheduling and tracking program. Physical inventories of food and drink items will be performed on a weekly basis. Further, daily, weekly, and monthly financial information will be provided to executive level management for analysis and comparison to our budget and to comparable restaurants. By closely monitoring each restaurant’s gross sales, cost of sales, labor, and other cost trends we will be better able to control our costs, inventory levels, and identify problems with individual operations, if any, early on.
 
Secret Shopper. Because we believe exceptional customer service is paramount to our success, we intend to implement a “secret shopper” program to monitor the quality control at all of our future restaurants. Secret shoppers are independent persons who test the quality of our food, drink, and service as paying customers without the knowledge of the restaurant’s management or employees. Secret shoppers then report their unbiased experiences to our executive level management.
 
Long-Term Growth Plan (5+ Years)
 
Ultra Premium Rums
 
Over the next five years we plan to expand and grow the Tiger Reef® brand of ultra premium rums into new territories, including:
 


Asia; 
 

European Union; 
 

Caribbean Region; 
 

Australia; and 
 

India. 
 
Mermaid Reef Ocean Grill & Lounge™
 
Over the next five years we plan to focus on a disciplined growth strategy of opening one new Mermaid Reef restaurant each year. We have also identified the following Caribbean islands we intend to eventually open a Mermaid Reef restaurant:
 


St. Maarten, Dutch West Indies 
 

Aruba, Dutch West Indies; 
 

Nassau, Bahamas; 
 

Cozumel, Mexico; 
 

Grand Cayman; and 
 

Barbados. 
 
We estimate that we will need to raise a minimum of $5 million to achieve the above listed goals and milestones. This capital will most likely be raised through the sales of additional equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders.
Sales and Marketing
 
7
 

Our marketing strategy is aimed at attracting new customers through both traditional and creative avenues. We intend to focus on building a reputation among local customers (those living on the island) while directing our marketing efforts toward tourists staying on the island or visiting for the day on a cruise ship. We intend to accomplish this through:
 


Grand opening promotions; 
 


Traditional paid advertising (e.g. radio, television, newspaper, etc.); 
 


Free media exposure (e.g. hosting charity events, food reviews, etc.); and 
 


Working directly with tourism bureau representatives and transportation representatives (taxi association, bus association, day sail and charter businesses, etc.). 
 
When opening a new restaurant we intend to host grand opening parties for local leaders, media personalities, hospitality employees such as resort and hotel staff, and tourism bureau representatives (inclusive of cruise ship industry representatives and hotel/resort industry representatives). Our goal with courting these groups is to introduce them to our concept and court them to refer new customers to our restaurants and provide us with free future media exposure.
 
Afterwards we will sustain awareness through more traditional marketing methods, including radio and television spots, newspaper ads, billboards and road signs, and resort and hotel concierge promotional cards and discount coupons.
 
If our strategy is successful it will lead to “word of mouth” referrals, which is our ultimate goal. This is accomplished by providing our customers with consistently excellent service and quality food and drinks.
 
While we do not have a fixed marketing budget, we do anticipate launching each new restaurant with a marketing blitz campaign and tapering it down to less than 5% of the restaurant’s annual gross sales once it is sufficiently established with regular and recurring revenue.
 
Financing
 
We estimate that we will need to generate at least $1.5 million in additional financing in order to maintain our current level of operations and meet our planned fiscal 2017 capital expenditures. Further, in order to proceed with our long-term plans, we anticipate that we will need to generate at least between $4 and $5 million in additional long-term financing.
 
We presently do not have an established or dependable source of financing. Currently we are exploring various sources of new financing to meet our basic working capital needs and provide for our planned capital expenditures. Without limiting our available options, future financings will most likely be through the sale of additional shares of our common stock. It is possible that we could also offer warrants, options and/or rights in conjunction with any future issuances of our common stock. However, we can give no assurance that sufficient financing will be available to us, and if available to us, in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional funds to meet our basic working capital needs, we may need to cease or curtail our business operations. 
 
Government Regulation
 
The restaurant industry is subject to many various laws which directly affect our organization and planned operations. Each restaurant we open must comply with various licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which typically include health, safety and fire authorities in the municipality where our restaurant is located. The development and operation of a successful restaurant depends upon selecting and acquiring a suitable location, which is normally subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic, and other regulations. Further, our operations will also be subject to various laws governing such matters as wages, health insurance requirements, working conditions, citizenship and work permit requirements, and mandatory overtime pay, all of which will directly affect our labor costs.
 
Additionally, because we anticipate a significant portion of our revenue to be generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages, we must comply with any and all regulations governing their sale. Typically this requires the proper licensing at each restaurant location (in many cases it needs to be renewed on an annual basis). Such licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. These regulations often relate to many aspects of the restaurant, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. The failure of any of our future restaurants to obtain and retain such a license would limit its ability 
 8
 

to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability at that particular location, which could subsequently impact our business’s overall revenues and ability to achieve (and if achieved, maintain) profitability.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
We have not incurred and do not anticipate incurring any expenses associated with environmental laws.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
Our Tiger Reef trademark and logo have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) with a serial number of 87158477, which is owned by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Tiger Reef Spirits, Ltd., an Anguilla International Business Company (“IBC”) that we formed on August 31, 2016.
Property and Equipment
 
Our principal executive office is located at Wellsburg Street #7, Cole Bay, St. Maarten, Dutch West Indies. This space is provided to us by our President and CEO, J. Scott Sitra, free of charge. There is no written agreement or other material terms relating to this arrangement.

Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 
In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ("JOBS Act") was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other things: 
 


Exemptions for emerging growth companies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of financing to small companies; 
 


Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; 
 


Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings; 
 


Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and 
 


Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation or offering requirements. 
 
In general, under the JOBS Act a company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering ("IPO") of common equity securities was effected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. A company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company after the earliest of:
 
9
 

(i)

the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more, 
 
(ii)

the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company's IPO; 
 
(iii)

the company's issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or 
 
(iv)

the company becoming a "larger accelerated filer" as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 
The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact Tiger Reef are discussed below. 
 
Financial Disclosure. The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows: 
 
(i)

audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years; 
 
(ii)

selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited; and 
 
(iii)

executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies. (A smaller reporting company is one with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter) 
 
However, the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. Tiger Reef is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations. 
 
The JOBS Act also exempts the company's independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") after the date of the JOBS Act's enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule. 
 
The JOBS Act also exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the company's accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit. 
 
Internal Control Attestation. The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the company's independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on the company's internal control over financial reporting, although management of the company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from the requirements in §14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for companies with a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes. 
 
Other Items of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The JOBS Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an emerging growth company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth company IPO. 
 
Section 106 of the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to submit 1933 Securities Act registration statements on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended to allow the emerging growth company to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow. 
 
10
 

Election to Opt Out of Transition Period. Section 102(b) (1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a 1933 Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard. 
 
The JOBS Act provides a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. Tiger Reef has elected not to opt out of the transition period pursuant to Section 107(b).
