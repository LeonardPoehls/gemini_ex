ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that benefit patients with unmet medical needs.  We currently have two compounds in development, Sollpura and blisibimod. We licensed Sollpura from Eli Lilly & Co (“Eli Lilly”) in July 2014.  Sollpura is a novel non-porcine investigational Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (“PERT”) intended for the treatment of patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (“EPI”), often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.  We licensed blisibimod from Amgen, Inc. (“Amgen”) in December 2007.  Blisibimod targets B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been shown to be elevated in a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including Immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or IgA nephropathy.
Sollpura
 
The exocrine pancreas is responsible for synthesis and secretion of digestive enzymes, including lipase, protease, and amylase. In addition, the pancreas secretes bicarbonate into the duodenum to neutralize the very high acidity of stomach contents.  EPI occurs when diseases such as cystic fibrosis (“CF”) and chronic pancreatitis (“CP”) impede or destroy the exocrine function of the pancreas.  A reduction in, or absence of, the normally secreted pancreatic digestive enzymes causes lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates to enter the distal gastrointestinal (“GI”) tract in un-absorbable forms, leading to GI pain and distention, mal-digestion, and steatorrhea.  Without appropriate therapy, patients with EPI may experience malnutrition, poor growth, weight loss, reduced quality of life, and, in severe cases, increased morbidity and early death.
 
PERT is currently the mainstay of treatment for nutrient malabsorption in patients with digestive enzyme deficiencies known as EPI and orally delivered porcine PERTs have been available for many years for its treatment.   As the porcine-derived proteins contained in the PERTs pass through the low pH environment of the stomach, they are protected by the enteric coating until they reach a pH of approximately 5.6 or greater in the duodenum and then are rapidly released.  Due to the bulk imposed by the enteric coating, most patients have to take 10-20 capsules per day in order to maintain their nutritional requirement.  Patient-to-patient differences in the acidity of the upper intestine makes dissolution of enterically-coated products variable, and gives rise to alterations in the rate and extent to which enzymes are released from these products.  Poor stability and variability in terms of potency and pharmaceutical properties have also been identified as important factors contributing to a poor response of some patients to PERTs.
 
Current PERTs are Suboptimal
 


Sollpura is a novel, non-porcine PERT that contains three biotechnology-derived digestive enzymes: a lipase, a protease and an amylase.  Through enzyme cross-linking, the lipase enzyme in Sollpura is more stable than the porcine-derived lipase in the low pH environment of the stomach and therefore Sollpura does not have an enteric polymer coating.  Furthermore, since the three enzymes in Sollpura are biotechnology-derived, Sollpura does not contain porcine proteins or purines that may be associated with a risk of viral transmission or allergic reaction to proteins of porcine origin.  The individual enzyme components of Sollpura are formulated at a fixed ratio of lipase, protease, and amylase.  The Sollpura enzyme dose ratio was selected from nonclinical efficacy studies conducted using a canine model of pancreatic insufficiency which demonstrated that the lipase enzyme in Sollpura was efficacious when administered at >500 units/kg per meal, and the protease doses >1000 units/kg per meal.  The suitability of the enzyme ratio in Sollpura is further supported by the observation that Sollpura and Creon were equi-effective in pigs with surgically-induced pancreatic insufficiency.

 Sollpura – a Potentially Transformative Therapy for EIP
 

We believe Sollpura has the potential to become the first soluble, stable and non-porcine derived enzyme product and offer a novel solution to patients who are unable to maintain appropriate nutritional health. Sollpura’s chemical characteristics, unlike currently available PERTs, make it ideal for powder formulation as either a capsule, or sachet of powder for oral solution which can be conveniently administered in solution in a small volume of water.
 
Our Phase 3 Development of Sollpura in EPI
 
We initiated a Phase 3 study of Sollpura ("RESULT") in patients with EPI due to cystic fibrosis in May 2017.  The RESULT study is a randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, non-inferiority, active-comparator study evaluating the non-inferiority of Sollpura with respect to Coefficient of Fat Absorption (“CFA”) compared to a commercially available PERT in a population of porcine-derived PERT responders.  The RESULT study’s design is modified from a previous Phase 3 study’s (“SOLUTION”) design to account for the design limitations in the SOLUTION study by 1) starting Sollpura dosing as 125% of the pre-study PERT dose, 2) allowing for a more “real life” dose adjustment, as needed, based on signs and symptoms throughout the primary treatment phase of the study, and 3) a shorter treatment duration of 4 weeks, with 3 weeks of dose optimization and 1 week of stable dosing.  Patients are then followed in a 20-week extension period for the collection of longer term safety and efficacy (e.g., growth, maintenance of body weight) data.  The RESULT study design was discussed with the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) prior to initiation.  Furthermore, the study had been approved by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Development Network (“CFFTDN”) Protocol Review Committee, and the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Clinical Trial Network Executive Committee.
 
The RESULT study enrolled 140 patients in North America, Eastern and Western Europe and Israel.  In December 2017 and January 2018, pre-specified interim futility analyses of the RESULT study were conducted by a Data Monitoring Committee (“DMC”) comprised of experts appointed by the CFFTDN when approximately 25% and 50% of patients had completed the 4-week treatment period; in each instance, the committee recommended the study to continue to completion as planned.  We expect to report topline data from the RESULT study in March 2018. 
 
A second, smaller Phase 3 study (“SIMPLICITY”) aimed at expanding the treatment age of patients to include patients age 28 days to seven years old, and enabling potential marketing approval for the sachet presentation of Sollpura, was initiated in the second quarter of 2016.  The SIMPLICITY study utilizes sachets containing Sollpura powder for oral solution.  The study is designed in two parts (Part A and Part B).  Part A which evaluated the safety and general usability of Sollpura powder for oral solution in 15 patients ≥7 years of age, was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016.  On December 9, 2016, an independent Data Monitoring Committee evaluated the data from Part A and approved progression to Part B, which will enroll pediatric subjects below 7 years of age.  Before we proceed with Part B, we plan to amend the SIMPLICITY study to follow a similar dosing approach as in the RESULT study and initiate enrollment in Part B in the second quarter of 2018.

Furthermore, during the third quarter of 2016, we initiated the EASY study, which provides continued access to Sollpura for patients in the Sollpura arm who completed the SOLUTION study. We have amended this study to also allow Sollpura-assigned patients completing the RESULT study at a lipase dose greater than 10,000 units/kg/day to have continued access until the Biological License Application (“BLA”) for Sollpura is approved by the FDA.
 
Lastly, prior to the RESULT study, we conducted another Phase 3 study (“SOLUTION”) in patients with EPI.  The SOLUTION study was also a randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, non-inferiority, active-comparator study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Sollpura.  This pivotal study enrolled 128 patients in North America, Europe and Israel.  Top line data announced in December 2016 showed that the study narrowly missed the CFA non-inferiority margin of the primary mITT analysis by one percent; however, by additional pre-specified analyses of CFA (mITT-Baseline Observation Carried Forward and Per Protocol), Sollpura met the non-inferiority criterion.  The study also demonstrated that the ratio of the three enzymes in Sollpura provided an appropriate response in coefficient of nitrogen absorption (“CNA").  In March 2017, we announced data from the extension phase of the study, which showed that Sollpura demonstrated comparable maintenance in key measurements of height, weight, and body mass index in addition to being well tolerated throughout the 12-week extension period.
 
We believe our Sollpura studies may offer a number of potential opportunities for differentiation versus the currently marketed porcine-derived PERTs, including:

 
  
· | use of biotechnology-derived high-purity enzymes that are produced by fermentation processes rather than from mammalian organs which carry a label warning for viral transmission;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ability to manufacture at a fixed ratio of lipase, protease and amylase that is similar to the enzyme secretions from the human pancreas;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | use of a novel, chemically-modified lipase drug substance that provides resistance to degradation at gastric pH, thereby obviating the need for enteric coating;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | lack of enteric coating allows for potentially fewer and smaller, easy to swallow capsules and adequate storage stability compared with porcine PERTs of an equivalent unit dose strength; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a sachet formulation containing Sollpura powder for oral solution which can be easily dissolved into water, and finally provides patients, especially young pediatric patients, with an easy-to-swallow dosing option.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blisibimod
 
BAFF, or B-cell Activating Factor (also known as B lymphocyte stimulator or BLyS), is a member of a tumor necrosis family of natural human proteins and is critical to the development, maintenance and survival of multiple B-cell lineages as well as plasma cells – all of which are critical to the human immune response.  B-cells and plasma cells are a vital part of the human immune system, producing natural antibody responses to invading pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and other dangerous antigens.  Abnormally high elevations of BAFF, B-cells and plasma cells have been associated with several autoimmune diseases, including lupus and IgA nephropathy.  BAFF is primarily expressed by macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells and interacts with three different receptors on B-cells and plasma cells including BAFF receptor, or BAFF-R, B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, and transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor, or TACI. The potential role of BAFF inhibition and associated reductions in B-cell and plasma cell numbers in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis has been validated in multiple clinical studies with blisibimod and other BAFF antagonists.
 
Blisibimod, a peptibody directed against BAFF, was developed as an alternative to antibodies and is produced in Escherichia coli bacterial culture, as opposed to antibodies that are typically produced in mammalian cell culture.  A peptibody is a novel fusion protein that is distinct from an antibody with several potential advantages, including ease of manufacture, potency and relatively small molecular weight. Blisibimod inhibits both soluble and membrane-bound BAFF.
 
Our Phase 2 Development of Blisibimod for Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy
 
IgA is a human antibody that helps the body fight infections.  IgA nephropathy may occur when plasma cells express excessive amounts of under-glycosylated IgA and subsequent immune complexes containing this immunogenic protein are deposited in the kidneys.  These IgA containing immune complexes deposit in the mesangium of glomeruli in the kidney and are proinflammatory.  As a result, kidney glomeruli become inflamed and damaged, leading to leakage of blood and protein into urine. According to a recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine (Wyatt & Julian, 2013), primary IgA nephropathy occurs at any age, most commonly with clinical onset in the second and third decades of life, and a large number of cases eventually progress to renal failure.  In patients with IgA nephropathy, levels of BAFF are significantly higher than in healthy individuals, and elevated levels of BAFF are associated with histological severity of disease in kidney tissue. In IgA nephropathy, plasma cells express immunogenic IgA that forms immune complexes that deposit in renal tissue and lead to renal inflammation and damage that can progress to renal failure and end-stage renal disease. Significant reductions in B-cell counts were observed in clinical studies of patients with lupus with blisibimod with concomitant decreases in proteinuria, serum immunoglobulins and autoantibodies, and increases in complement C3. We believe inhibition of BAFF may reduce B-cell proliferation, maturation, and survival, thereby reducing serum levels of IgA and targeting antibodies, and therefore reduce progressive renal damage in patients with IgA nephropathy.

In June 2013, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical study, (“BRIGHT-SC”) of patients with IgA nephropathy in Asia and Eastern Europe.  The BRIGHT-SC study was a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in IgA nephropathy.  Enrollment criteria included biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy and proteinuria greater than one gram but less than six grams per 24 hours (1g-6g/24hr).  Patients must have been receiving standard of care medication including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers. Patients enrolled in the BRIGHT-SC study received 300mg weekly blisibimod or placebo subcutaneously during the first 8 weeks of therapy, the induction phase, followed by a minimum of 24 weeks of 200mg weekly blisibimod or placebo, the maintenance phase.  The BRIGHT-SC study enrolled 58 patients.  In August 2017, we reported top line data from the completed extension of the BRIGHT-SC study in which all patients had the opportunity to complete at least 60 weeks of treatment and some patients were treated for up to two years.  Throughout the treatment period and for up to one year of additional follow up off treatment, blisibimod appeared to halt disease progression as measured by the mean estimate of urinary protein:creatinine levels ("proteinuria").  Specifically, in patients treated with blisibimod, the mean change in proteinuria was stable to trending slightly downward, whereas the mean levels increased for patients in the placebo arm.  Additionally, blisibimod showed a trend toward preservation of renal function based upon individual rates of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (“eGFR”), with an annualized improvement of +6.2mL/min/1.73 m2 per year compared to a worsening of -4.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 with placebo as seen in the graph below.  Furthermore, serum immunoglobulins IgA, IgG, and IgM, demonstrated marked reduction throughout the treatment period.
 


 Market Opportunity
 
Sollpura for the treatment of Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI)
 
According to our estimate, EPI is a disease that affects an estimated 130,000 patients in the United States.  The most common causes of EPI are chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis, the former a longstanding inflammation of the pancreas altering the organ's normal structure and function that can result from malnutrition, heredity, or (in the western world especially), behavior (alcohol use and smoking), and the latter a recessive hereditary disease most common in Europeans and Ashkenazi Jews where the molecular culprit is an altered, CFTR-encoded chloride channel. In children, another common cause is Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting from mutation in the SBDS gene.

Blisibimod for the treatment of IgA Nephropathy
 
According to the National Organization for Rare Diseases, primary IgA nephropathy occurs at any age, most commonly with clinical onset in the second and third decades of life and a large number of cases eventually progress to renal failure. There is also a striking geographic variation in the prevalence of IgA nephropathy throughout the world.  In the United States, IgA nephropathy is considered an orphan disease as it is believed to affect approximately 130,000 people annually.  In August 2017, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for blisibimod for the treatment of IgA.  The prevalence of IgA nephropathy varies throughout the world, with the highest prevalence in Asia (Singapore, Japan and China), Australia, Finland and southern Europe (20 to 40% of all glomerulonephritis).  In Asia, routine urinalyses are performed for school children and renal biopsies for patients with asymptomatic hematuria, and the reported prevalence of the disease is much higher.  For example, in Japan, IgA nephropathy is estimated to affect over 350,000 people annually. According to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 25% of adults with IgA nephropathy eventually develop total kidney failure.
 
Manufacturing Strategy
 
Sollpura
 
We completed technology transfer for pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) manufacturing and drug product manufacturing in 2016, and estimate that we will complete process validation for the fermentation and associated down-stream purification for all three enzyme APIs in 2019.  In parallel, commercial scale capsule and sachet drug product manufacturing process validation is anticipated to be completed in 2019.
Regulatory Strategy
 
Sollpura   The RESULT study protocol has been reviewed by the FDA prior to initiation.  We believe that the design of RESULT provides adequate evaluation of efficacy and safety of Sollpura to respond to the FDA’s 2011 complete response letter.  The RESULT study should also address the 2005 EMA protocol assistance comments, which were consistent with the FDA’s request for an active comparator trial.  We anticipate completing the Phase 3 clinical trials with Sollpura (the RESULT and SIMPLICITY studies) in 2018, and process validation for commercial manufacture of Sollpura APIs and drug product in 2019, with a target submission date of the Biologics Licence Application (“BLA”) in 2019.
 
IgA Nephropathy
 
In September 2013, we met with the FDA who agreed to consider accepting proteinuria as a surrogate endpoint under a Subpart E approval for blisibimod for treatment of IgA nephropathy. In April 2014, we met with the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) to discuss our registration program for blisibimod in IgA nephropathy. In this meeting we gained the PMDA’s agreement on the acceptability of proteinuria as the primary efficacy endpoint to support marketing approval in Japan. In December 2014 we met with the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) as part of the scientific advice process for blisibimod, and reached agreement on the acceptability of proteinuria as the primary efficacy variable, as well as the sufficiency of a single study to support a Conditional Marketing Authorization Application (“CMAA”) provided that confirmatory evidence from a second study would be available post approval. The EMA also recommended that the protocol provide information on the required duration of treatment, duration of response and need for re-treatment. Given the observed effects of blisibimod on proteinuria in patients with lupus, we are currently evaluating our options for investigating the effects of blisibimod in B-cell associated glomerulonephritides.
 
Historical Clinical Studies by Licensor - Sollpura
 
Sollpura was studied from 2002 to 2009 in seven clinical trials, in which a total of 492 unique subjects received at least 1 dose of Sollpura.  Three Phase 1 trials were conducted, 1 in healthy volunteers and 2 in subjects with EPI due to CF.  Two short-term trials, the Phase 2 Study TC-2A, and the Phase 3 Study 726 evaluated the efficacy of Sollpura in subjects ≥7 years of age with EPI due to CF.  Two long-term Phase 3 safety and tolerability trials were also conducted:  Study 767 in subjects with EPI due to CF and Study 810 in subjects with EPI due to chronic pancreatitis/pancreatectomy.  Completed clinical trials demonstrated that dietary fat and nitrogen (protein) absorption are significantly increased in patients with cystic fibrosis and EPI who received Sollpura.  In 2013, Eli Lilly gained agreement from the FDA on the design of a pivotal trial that would provide adequate evaluation of efficacy and safety.
 
The dose-ranging Phase 1 study TC-1B evaluated five dose levels across a 50-fold range, from 100-to-5000 lipase units (U) per kg per meal in CF-EPI subjects. In this study, greater improvements in nutrients absorption, as measured using the percent change from baseline in the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) and CNA, were observed at doses of 500 lipase U per kg per meal and higher.

Study TC-2A, a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, dose-finding trial, was conducted in 125 pediatric and adult subjects with CF-related EPI who were treated with Sollpura for 28 days in one of three dosing regimens containing 6,500 U, 32,500 U, and 130,000 U lipase administered per meal or snack.  Observed mean CFAs at the end of study were 56.2%, 67.0%, and 69.7% in the 6,500, 32,500, and 130,000 U dose groups, respectively (one-way ANOVA p = 0.0032) with significant improvements in mean changes from baseline (one-way ANOVA p = 0.0005) and mean changes from baseline off-enzyme CFA to on treatment were 1.2%, 11.4% and 17.3%, respectively (1-way ANOVA p=0.0005).  Pairwise comparison of the CFA values showed that statistically greater improvements were observed at the higher doses of Sollpura compared with the lowest dose of 6,500 U.  Similar improvements in the CNA, were observed with Sollpura at the two highest dose levels.
 
Study 726, a Phase 3, placebo-controlled, parallel design, multinational clinical, evaluated the effects of a single capsule of Sollpura (containing 32,500 U lipase, with protease and amylase in fixed ratios) or placebo administered with every meal or snack in subjects with cystic fibrosis-related EPI.  Among the 138 subjects enrolled in this study, treatment with Sollpura resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline in the CFA of 21.2% with Sollpura compared with 6.0% with placebo (p = 0.0011).  The median body weight of subjects in this trial was 50 kg, for which the corresponding Sollpura dose was 650 U lipase/kg/meal or snack.
 
Two one-year studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and effects on nutritional status of Sollpura. Study 810 evaluated adult subjects with EPI due to CP or after pancreatectomy.  Among the 214 subjects who were treated, an average dose of 5.5 capsules (containing 32,500 U lipase, with protease and amylase in fixed ratios) of Sollpura per day maintained nutritional status as assessed by serial measurement of height and weight, including age-appropriate growth and weight gain in children. Mean BMI z-scores for subjects in Study 767 were maintained over time on study (mean BMI z-score at baseline, Months 3, 6, and 12 were -0.503, -0.637, -0.688, and -0.655, respectively).
 
Historical Clinical Studies – Blisibimod
 
To date, five randomized, clinical studies have been conducted with blisibimod in patients with lupus: two Phase 1 dose-ranging studies by our licensor, Amgen; and two double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging clinical outcomes studies, PEARL-SC (Phase 2b) and CHABLIS-SC1 (Phase 3), and a Phase 2 Open-Label Extension study (OLE) by the Company.  All five clinical studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of subcutaneous blisibimod versus placebo in patients with active and seropositive lupus.  The PEARL-SC study was completed in June 2012 and the CHABLIS-SC1 study was completed in November 2016.  Both studies failed to meet the primary endpoints and we elected to stop further development of blisibimod for the treatment of lupus.
 
In the CHABLIS-SC1 study, the primary endpoint compared the effects of blisibimod and placebo at Week 52 using the SLE Responder Index-6 (SRI-6): ≥6-point improvement in SELENA-SLEDAI, no new BILAG 1A or 2B domain scores, and <0.3-point increase in Physician’s Global Assessment. Compared with placebo, a higher proportion of subjects on blisibimod met the SRI-6 criteria from Week 16 through Week 52.  However, this effect was not statistically significant at the primary endpoint analysis at Week 52.  There was a statistically-significant steroid sparing effect among subjects randomized to blisibimod wherein 17.2% of subjects in the blisibimod group achieved corticosteroid dose of less than or equivalent to 7.5 mg prednisone compared with 8.9% in the control group (p=0.019).  In subjects with baseline urinary protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥0.5 g/g, significantly higher proportions of blisibimod subjects achieved >50% reduction in UPCR, and/or UPCR <0.5 g/g.  Reductions in SLE autoantibodies and B cells, and increases in complement C3 and C4 were observed with blisibimod.  We believe that these data support the further research with blisibimod patients with B-cell associated glomerulonephritides including IgA nephropathy, lupus with renal manifestations, and membranous glomerulonephritis.  As a result of the outcomes of the CHABLIS-SC1 trial, at the end of 2016 we elected to discontinue the Phase 3 CHABLIS-7.5 study, which was initiated in June 2016.
 
Research and Development
 
Since our inception in 2004, we have focused primarily on developing our product candidates, which currently include Sollpura for EPI and blisibimod for IgA nephropathy and potentially other glomerulonephritides.  In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we incurred $28.6 million, $46.5 million and $33.5 million, respectively, of research and development expense. 
Our Strategy
 
Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation, including enzyme replacement therapies and renal disease. To achieve these objectives, we intend to initially focus on the following activities.
Advance Clinical Development of Sollpura
 
We are advancing the development of Sollpura in a Phase 3 registration program in patients with cystic fibrosis-related EPI.  If our Phase 3 clinical study is successful, we intend to commercialize Sollpura in the U.S. and seek strategic corporate partners whose capabilities complement ours to launch Sollpura outside of U.S.

Seek Collaborative Corporate Partner for Blisibimod
 
We have received orphan drug designation for blisibimod for the treatment of IgA nephropathy.  We plan to opportunistically enter into collaborations with third parties for the development of blisibimod in renal disease and other B-cell associated glomerulonephritides.
Developing Commercial Strategies Designed to Maximize Our Product Candidates’ Market Potential
 
Our product candidates are focused on highly-specialized physician segments, such as cystic fibrosis specialists and nephrologists. We believe that we can build a small, focused sales force capable of marketing our products effectively in acute care and orphan indications.
Competition
 
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.  Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.  Our primary competitors who market PERTs approved in the U.S. or are developing PERTs in the U.S. are described in further detail below. We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of blisibimod, one of these U.S. patents (or another patent issuing from a related patent application) is expected to be eligible for a patent term restoration of up to five years under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. See “—Regulatory Matters— Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity.”  This could extend the expiration date of the U.S. Patent to as late as May 2027, March 2028 or November 2028, depending on which patent the term restoration is applied to.  We intend to pursue pediatric exclusivity as well, which could add an additional six months to the patent term.  The exclusively licensed EP patents are currently scheduled to expire in May 2022.  One of these patents is expected to be eligible for a Supplementary Protection Certificate of up to five years, which could extend the expiration date to May 2027.
 
The U.S. patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications.  A non-provisional patent application is examined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards for patentability.  A provisional patent application is not examined, and automatically expires 12 months after its filing date.  As a result, a provisional patent application cannot mature into a patent.  The requirements for filing a provisional patent application are not as strict as those for filing a non-provisional patent application. Provisional applications are often used, among other things, to establish an early filing date for a subsequent non-provisional patent application.

The filing date of a non-provisional patent application is used by the USPTO to determine what information is prior art when it considers the patentability of a claimed invention. If certain requirements are satisfied, a non-provisional patent application can claim the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed provisional patent application.  As a result, the filing date accorded by the provisional patent application may remove information that otherwise could preclude the patentability of an invention.
 
We are aware of two third-party issued U.S. patents that contain broad claims related to BLyS or BAFF binding polypeptides. Based on our analyses, if these patents were asserted against us, we do not believe that blisibimod would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents.  If we were to challenge the validity of either of these issued U.S. patents in court, we would need to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to every U.S. patent by presenting clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent’s claims.  There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity, and we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate these suits.  If third-party patents are determined to be valid and construed to cover blisibimod, the development and commercialization of this program could be affected, subjecting us to potential liability for damages and possibly requiring us to obtain a license to continue marketing the affected product.  Such a license may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
 
Current License Agreements
 
Eli Lilly and Company
 
In July 2014, we entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement with Eli Lilly (the “Lilly Agreement”), to develop and commercialize Sollpura, a Phase 3 novel investigational PERT for the treatment of patients with EPI, often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other conditions.  Under the terms of the Lilly Agreement, we were not required to make any up-front payment but are obligated to make milestone payments of up to $33.5 million for capsule products and $9.5 million for reformulated products upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sales milestones, none of which have been achieved as of December 31, 2017.  In addition, after sales of the licensed products exceed an aggregate of $100.0 million in the United States, we are obligated to pay tiered royalties on future net sales of products, ranging from the single digits to the mid-teens for products that are developed and approved as defined in the Lilly Agreement. Our royalty obligations as to a particular licensed product will be payable, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, for the longer of (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell, or import of such licensed product by us or a sublicense in such country, or (b) 12 years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country.
Amgen
 
In December 2007, we entered into a license agreement with Amgen, which was amended in October 2009 and November 2014 (as amended, the “Amgen Agreement”), pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain technology and compounds relating to blisibimod, as well as a non-exclusive worldwide license to technology relating to certain peptibody compositions of matter and formulations.  The licensed patents included a specific set of previously filed U.S. and foreign patents and applications, as well as any applications filed after the execution date by Amgen and covering licensed know-how.  During the period of the agreement, we are responsible for the filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance of all exclusively licensed blisibimod patents and applications. Amgen retains the right to review all documents relating to said filing, prosecution, defense and maintenance, and we are required to incorporate all reasonable comments or suggestions that Amgen makes with regard to these documents.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Amgen Agreement, we have paid $6.0 million in license fees to Amgen for blisibimod.  In addition, we are required to make various milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives, including payment upon commencement of the first Phase 3 clinical study for any blisibimod formulation in the United States or European Union. We are also required to pay up to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain pre-approval clinical development milestones and up to $23.0 million upon achievement of certain post-approval milestones. Furthermore, we are required to make tiered quarterly royalty payments on net sales, which increase as a percentage from the high single digits to the low double digits as net sales increase. Our royalty payment obligations for a particular product in a particular country begin on the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in that country, and end upon the later of 10 years from the date of first commercial sale in that country or the expiration date of the last valid claim of a licensed patent that covers the manufacture, use or sale, offer to sell or import of the product.
 
The Amgen Agreement will remain in effect until we elect to terminate, or until termination for material breach by either party or insolvency on our part. Under these terms, Amgen can terminate the agreement if we fail to meet our obligations, resulting in a loss of our exclusive rights to the licensed technology.

In connection with a collaborative arrangement with Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd (“Zenyaku”) for the development of IgA nephropathy that was executed in December 2014 and terminated in January 2016, we amended the Amgen Agreement in November 2014 to (i) adjust certain royalty and milestone payment obligations payable to Amgen in light of our collaboration with Zenyaku and (ii) provide that the sublicense granted by us to Zenyaku shall survive the termination of the Amgen Agreement.  Under this amendment, we also agreed to grant Amgen that number of shares of our common stock equal to $1.0 million divided by the volume weighted average price of our common stock for 20 trading days prior to issuance.  We issued 420,751 shares of common stock to Amgen at $2.3767 per share on January 28, 2015 pursuant to a subscription agreement with Amgen, with the consideration paid by Amgen in the form of a waiver of a fee otherwise payable to Amgen under the Amgen Agreement.
 
Manufacturing and Supply
 
We currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce drug substances and drug products required for our clinical studies under current GMP with oversight by our internal managers.  We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our product candidates if and when approved for marketing by the FDA.  Our contract manufacturers obtain the raw materials for the drug substances and drug products required for our clinical studies from a variety of sources. We believe that this will provide a sufficient supply of these raw materials and drug product to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. We do not have in place long term supply agreements with respect to all of the components of any of our pharmaceutical systems, however, and are subject to the risk that we may not be able to procure all required components in adequate quantities with acceptable quality, within acceptable time frames or at reasonable cost.
 
Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including toxic chemical and biological materials. Accordingly, we are subject to federal, state and local laws governing the use, handling and disposal of these materials. We believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply in all material respects with the standards prescribed by local, state and federal regulations.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Given our stage of development, we have not developed a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We expect that we would develop these capabilities once we receive Phase 3 data in contemplation of FDA approval and the commercial launch of our product candidates.  In order to commercialize our product candidates, we plan to develop these capabilities internally or through collaboration with third parties.  In selected therapeutic areas where we feel that any approved products can be commercialized by a specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians, we may seek to commercialize the product candidates alone. We also plan to seek commercialization partners for products in international markets.
 
We intend to build the commercial infrastructure necessary to bring our product candidates to market.  In addition to a specialty sales force, sales management, internal sales support and an internal marketing group, we will need to establish capabilities to manage key accounts, such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies and government accounts.  We may also choose to employ medical sales liaisons personnel to support our products.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing.  Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through either the new drug application, or NDA, process, or the biologics license application, or BLA, process before they may legally be marketed in the United States.  Both of our drug candidates, Sollpura and blisibimod, are biologically manufactured and will go through the BLA process for approval if successful in Phase 3.
United States Drug Development Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations and biological products under both the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.  Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions.  These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license revocation, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.  The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

 

14
 


  
· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biological product for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug or BLA for a biological product;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug or biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
--+-------------------------------------------



The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.  Once a pharmaceutical or biological product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage.  Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy.  An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND.  The sponsor includes a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation.  Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted.  The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period.  In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin.  Clinical holds may also be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
 
All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations.  These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.  Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution.  An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.  The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or to his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.   Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA for review, and to the IRBs for approval.
 
Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

  
 
· | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. Involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA.  Safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators within 15 days after the sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure.  A sponsor also must notify FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within 7 days after the sponsor’s receipt of the information.  Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.  The FDA, a data safety monitoring board, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.  Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

 

15
 


Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.  The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidates and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product.  Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
 
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug or biological product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug or BLA for a biological product, requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended, an NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration is required to submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no end-of-Phase 2 meeting as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 
The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a NDA or BLA for filing.  In this event, the NDA or BLA must be re-submitted with the additional information.  The re-submitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.  Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.  The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP- compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity.  The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, has an acceptable purity profile and is adequately potent, and whether its manufacturing meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued identity, sterility, safety, purity and potency.  Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.  The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.  An advisory committee is a panel of experts who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA on matters of importance that come before the agency.  The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee but it generally follows such recommendations.
 
The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information.  Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.  The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form.  The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA.  The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application



16
 

 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.  Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.  In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess a drug or biological product’s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendment.  The Hatch-Waxman Amendment permits a patent term restoration of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.  However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date.  The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application.  Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent.  The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.  In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent terms for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain competitor applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity.  A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance.  During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval.  However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.   The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug.  This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent.  Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA.  However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provides 12 years of data exclusivity for innovator biologics.  During this exclusivity period, competitors are barred from relying on the innovator’s safety and efficacy data to gain FDA approval.  Therefore, a competitor seeking to obtain marketing approval during this exclusivity period would be required to conduct its own preclinical and clinical studies.
 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification.  This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA.  After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.  Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or by providing a major contribution to patient care, for seven years.   Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product, but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.  Orphan product exclusivity could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if any of our product candidates is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.  If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.



17
 

 
The FDA also administers a clinical research grants program, whereby researchers may compete for funding to conduct clinical studies to support the approval of drugs, biologics, medical devices and medical foods for rare diseases and conditions.  A product does not have to be designated as an orphan product to be eligible for the grant program.  An application for an orphan grant should propose one discrete clinical study to facilitate FDA approval of the product for a rare disease or condition. The clinical study may address an unapproved new product or an unapproved new use for a product already on the market.
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition.   Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied.  For a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review on a rolling basis sections of the NDA or BLA before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.
 
A fast track product may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval.  A fast track product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products.  The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.  Additionally, a fast track product may be eligible for accelerated approval.  Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well- controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.  As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies.  Fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 
Sponsors may request that their drug be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy.  The goal of this program is to expedite the development and review of a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.  The FDA actions to expedite the development of a Breakthrough Therapy include (a) holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug, (b) providing timely advice to and interactive communication with the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable, (c) involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review, (d) assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor and (e) taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any drug or biological products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.  Drugs and biological products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers of drugs and biological products must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance.  In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

 

18
 


Drug and biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs or biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.  The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug or biological product.  Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release.
 
Manufacturers of biological products must also report to the FDA any deviations from cGMP that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product; or any unexpected or unforeseeable event that may affect the safety, purity or potency of a distributed product. The regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose documentation requirements.
 
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct.
 
The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical studies, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.
 
In addition, from time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.
 
In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States.  Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries.  The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.  The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
In the European Union, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, which provide, among other things, that no medicinal product may be placed on the market of a European Union member state unless a marketing authorization has been issued by the European Medicines Agency or a national competent authority.  European Union member states require regulatory clearance by both the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical study.
 
Under the European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.  The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states.  The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases such as neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes and products designated as orphan medicinal products, and optional for those products which are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients.  The decentralized procedure of approval provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the reference member state.  Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials (draft summary of product characteristics, draft labeling and package leaflet) to the reference member state and concerned member states.  The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.

Reimbursement
 
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability and adequacy of third-party reimbursement.  Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, including, at the federal and state level, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.  We anticipate third-party payors will provide reimbursement for our product although we cannot predict the level of reimbursement such third-party payors will provide for our products.  Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products.  We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products.  Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective.  It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors.  Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our product on a competitive and profitable basis.
 
In addition, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably.  For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, and mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
 

The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, creating a new methodology by which rebates owed by are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010 and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits (phased-in by 2014). Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.
 .
 
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, and included a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under a new Medicare Part D. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs.  Part D prescription drug plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized.  Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.  While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.  However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class.  Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee.
 
Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval.  However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.  Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.

For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although under the current state of the law these newly eligible entities (with the exception of children’s hospitals) will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. As 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our drug candidates, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat are the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s drug could adversely affect the sales of our drug candidate. If third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis.
 
In recent years, additional laws have resulted in direct or indirect reimbursement reductions for certain Medicare providers, including:
 
•          The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken.
 
•          The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 
•          The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services reduce the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule by 2% in 2013, which served as a base for 2014 and subsequent years.  In addition, effective January 1, 2014, CMS also began bundling the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting.
 
These laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
 As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. We expect that an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.There are also laws that govern a company’s eligibility to participate in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. For example, a company may be debarred from participation if it is found to have violated federal anti-kickback laws, which could have a significant effect on a company’s ability to operate its business. These laws are discussed below.
 
The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest.  We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations, and additional legislative proposals.  Indeed, we expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs.  At the present time, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies for drugs. However, Congress is considering passing legislation that would lift the ban on federal negotiations.  While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies.  While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and operate profitably.
 
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.  For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.  A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.  In some countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of marketing approval.  To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies.  There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for our product.

Other Healthcare Laws
 
For our product and any product candidates which may obtain regulatory approval and are marketed in the United States, our arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers, and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to health information privacy and security regulation by U.S. federal and state governments and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below:

· | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party on its behalf) to, knowingly and willfully offer, solicit, receive, or pay remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward the referral of an individual for or the purchase or recommendation of an item or for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,957and $21,916 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and the potential implication of various federal criminal statutes. The government may deem manufacturers to have "caused" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. Our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law.

· | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly or willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, which imposes, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates, relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damage or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the ACA, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program for certain payments and other “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Analogous state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payor. Such laws are enforced by various state agencies and through private actions. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances. Such data privacy and security laws may differ from one another in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations.  Federal and state enforcement bodies have scrutinized interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry.  It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement ,exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business.
