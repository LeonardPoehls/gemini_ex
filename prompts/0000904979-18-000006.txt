Business is awarded as a result of our ability to successfully bid on and win the production and supply of parts for models that will be newly introduced to the market by the OEMs. 
Raw Materials 
The primary raw materials required for our operations are hot-rolled and cold-rolled coated steel, rolled-aluminum and aluminum and magnesium ingots. We obtain steel from a number of primary steel producers and steel service centers. The majority of the steel is purchased through customers' steel buying programs. Under these programs, we purchase steel at the price that our customers negotiated with their steel suppliers. Our most significant steel suppliers are AK Steel, ArcelorMittal, Kenwal Steel Corporation, Nucor Corporation, SSAB Swedish Steel Corporation, Steel Technologies, Tata Steels and U.S. Steel. We take ownership of the steel in many instances; however, the customers are generally responsible for commodity price fluctuations. Most of the steel owned by us is purchased domestically. A portion of our steel products and processing services are provided to customers on a toll processing basis. Under these arrangements, we charge a specified fee for operations performed without acquiring ownership of the steel and being burdened with the attendant costs of ownership and risk of loss. Through centralized purchasing, we attempt to purchase raw materials at the lowest competitive prices for the quantity purchased. The amount of steel available for processing is a function of the production levels of primary steel producers.
For our aluminum and magnesium, used in the CastLight® product brand, the cost of raw materials is adjusted frequently to align with secured purchase commitments based on customer releases or based on referenced metal index plus additional material cost spreads agreed to by us and our customers. Primary aluminum alloys are used in our proprietary "Thin Tech" castings processes, which allow heat treat and enhanced mechanical properties. The primary supplier for the Shiloh is Rio Tinto Alcan. Secondary smelting is the process of recycling aluminum, which has a positive impact environmentally and economically. These types of alloys are used in our conventional die casting process. The secondary aluminum suppliers for the Company include Imperial Aluminum, Real Alloy Holding Incorporated, Spectro Alloy Corporation and Superior Aluminum Alloys. The primary supplier for magnesium alloy for US operations is US Magnesium LLC. For our European operations, magnesium alloy originates from China and is delivered from either Chinese magnesium producers or metal trading companies that conduct business in Europe.
Competition 
We compete in the laser welding, stamping, die casting and close-tolerance machining industries. Competitors within our main product brands vary. BlankLight® competitors include numerous metal blanking companies ranging in all sizes, including raw material manufacturers and customers. Welded blank competition in North America is primarily comprised of TWB Company LLC and ArcelorMittal USA. Most laser welded blank competitors are affiliated with raw material or distribution providers. Competition for sales of automotive stamping and assemblies is also intense. Primary StampLight® competitors are Gestamp, L&W, Inc., Flex-n-Gate Corporation, Midway Products Group Inc., Narmco Group and Kirchhoff Automotive Group. CastLight® competitors include Bocar Group, Cosma International (a Magna Company), Georg Fischer, Gnotec AB, KSM Casting Group, Madison Kipp Corporation (MKC), Meridian (subsidiary of Wangfeng Auto Holdings Group), Nemak, Pace Industries, RCM Industries and Ryobi Aluminum Casting (USA), Inc., which are all competing for a growing number of automotive projects. In almost all instances, we compete through our main strategies of "Lightweighting without compromise®" and "Lightweighting with Benefits®", which provides us with the ability to provide solutions that do not compromise part integrity such as performance, safety, sound and efficiency. Development and design optimization to lightweight products allow customers to achieve vehicle weight, fuel economy and/or ride and handling targets while favorably impacting the environment.
Employees 
As of October 31, 2017, we had approximately 3,600 employees. Organized labor unions represent approximately 17% of our U.S. hourly employees and approximately 92% of our non-U.S. employees. 
Each of our unionized manufacturing facilities has its own labor agreement with its own expiration date. As a result, no contract expiration date affects more than one facility.

Backlog 
A significant portion of our business pertains to automobile platforms for various model years. Orders against these platforms are subject to releases by the customer and are not considered firm orders until close to time of shipment. Backlog, therefore, is not a meaningful indicator of future performance. 
Seasonality 
Our business is moderately seasonal because many North American OEM customers close assembly plants for periods in June and July for model year changeovers and for additional periods during the December and January holiday season. For Europe, July and August and additional periods during December and January are lower volume months due to customer shutdown and the holiday season. Shut-down periods in the rest of world vary by country. Historically, our sales and operating profits have been strongest in the second and fourth quarters. For additional information, refer to our quarterly financial results contained in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this report. 
Environmental Matters 
We are subject to environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air, discharges to waterways and generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. 
We are also subject to laws and regulations that can require the remediation of contamination that exists at current or former facilities. In addition, we are subject to other federal and state laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters. The majority of our production facilities have permits and licenses allowing and regulating air emissions and water discharges. While the Company believes that at the present time its production facilities are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and it is impossible to predict whether compliance with these laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us in the future. 
ISO 14001 is a voluntary international standard issued in September 1996 and updated in 2015 by the International Organization for Standardization. ISO 14001 identifies the elements of an Environmental Management System ("EMS") necessary for an organization to effectively manage its effect on the environment. The ultimate objective of the standard is to integrate the EMS with overall business management processes and systems so that environmental considerations are a routine part of business decisions.  All of our manufacturing facilities are certified to the ISO 14001 standard. We have completed the certification process at each of our manufacturing facilities to the ISO/TS 16949 standard, which has been the global benchmark for an international quality management system in the automotive industry.  We are in the process of transitioning to the upgraded International Automotive Task Force ("IATF")16949 standard, with our first two audited manufacturing facilities being recommended for certification. The IATF 16949 certification will be a market requirement for doing business in the automotive industry.
Research and Development
 We perform research, development, design and other engineering activities for the following primary reasons:

• | to provide solutions for customers;


• | to integrate our leading technologies into advanced products and processes;


• | to provide engineering support for all of our manufacturing sites; and


• | to provide technological expertise in engineering and design development.

Along with our global manufacturing locations,we maintain technical centers in Asia (Shanghai, China), Europe (Gothenburg, Sweden) and in North America (Valley City, Ohio and Plymouth, Michigan). Furthermore, we have Sales and Engineering Offices in the United Kingdom (Evesham, England) and Germany (Munich).  Each of our business units is engaged in engineering, research and development efforts working closely with customers to develop custom solutions to meet their needs.
Intellectual Property
We hold 102 issued patents on a worldwide basis, including 39 granted US patents and in excess of 39 patent applications in process worldwide. Of the approximately 102 issued patents, approximately 28% are in production use and/or are licensed to third parties, and the remaining 72% are being considered for future production use or provide a strategic technological benefit to the us. We do not materially rely on any single patent, nor will the expiration of any single patent materially affect our business. Our current patents expire over various periods into the year 2032. We are actively introducing and patenting new technology to replace formerly patented technology before the expiration of the existing patents. In the aggregate, our worldwide patent portfolio 
 5

is materially important to our business because it enables us to achieve technological differentiation from our competitors. We also maintain more than 35 active trademark registrations and applications worldwide. In excess of 90% of these trademark registrations and applications are in commercial use by us or are licensed to third parties.
Segment and Geographic Information 
We conduct our business and report our information as one operating segment - Automotive and Commercial Vehicles. Our chief operating decision maker has been identified as the executive leadership team, which includes certain Vice Presidents, all Senior Vice Presidents plus the Chief Executive Officer of the Company as this team has the final authority over performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. In determining that one operating segment is appropriate, we considered the nature of the business activities, the existence of managers responsible for the operating activities and information presented to the Board of Directors for its consideration and advice. Customers and suppliers are substantially the same in the automotive and commercial vehicle industry.
Financial information regarding Company geographic mix is contained in Note 21 - Business Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this report.
