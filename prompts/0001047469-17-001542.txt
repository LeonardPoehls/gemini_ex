      ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
  Our Company 
         HD Supply is one of the largest industrial distributors in North America. We believe we have leading positions in the three distinct market sectors in which we specialize: Maintenance, Repair & Operations ("MRO"); Infrastructure; and Specialty Construction. These market sectors are large and fragmented, and we believe they present opportunities for significant growth. We aspire to be the "First Choice" of customers, associates, suppliers and the communities in which we operate. This aspiration drives our relentless focus and is reflected in the customer and market centricity, speed and precision, intense teamwork, process excellence and trusted relationships that define our culture. We believe this aspiration distinguishes us from other distributors and has created value for our shareholders, driven above-market growth and delivered attractive returns on invested capital. 
         We serve our markets with an integrated go-to-market strategy. We operate through approximately 500 locations across 48 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces. We have approximately 14,000 associates delivering localized, customer-tailored products, services and expertise. We serve approximately 530,000 customers, which include contractors, government entities, maintenance professionals, home builders and industrial businesses. Our broad range of end-to-end product lines and services include approximately 845,000 stock-keeping units ("SKUs") of quality, name-brand and proprietary-brand products as well as value-add services supporting the entire life-cycle of a project from infrastructure and construction to maintenance, repair and operations. 
         For the fiscal year ended January 29, 2017, or fiscal 2016, we:
 

 generated $7 billion in Net sales, representing 4.4% growth over the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, or fiscal 2015; 
 generated Net income of $196 million in fiscal 2016, as compared to a Net income of $1,472 million in fiscal 2015, which included
income tax credits of $1,196 million; 
 generated $921 million of Adjusted EBITDA, representing 5.1% growth over fiscal 2015; and 
 generated $532 million of Adjusted net income in fiscal 2016, as compared to $351 million in fiscal 2015. 

         For a reconciliation of Net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income, see "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsKey Business MetricsAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss)." 
         We believe our long-standing customer relationships and competitive advantage stem from our knowledgeable associates, extensive product and service offerings, national footprint, integrated best-in-class technology, broad purchasing scale and strategic supplier relationships. We believe that our comprehensive supply chain solutions improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our customers' businesses. Our value-add services include customer training, material and product fabrication, kitting, jobsite delivery, will-call pickup options, as well as onsite managed inventory, online material management and emergency response capabilities. Furthermore, we believe our product application knowledge, comprehensive product assortment, and sourcing expertise allow our customers to perform reliably and give them the tools to enhance profitability. 
         We reach our customers through a variety of sales channels, including professional outside and inside sales forces, call centers and branch-supported direct marketing programs utilizing market-specific product catalogs, and business unit websites. Our distribution network allows us to provide rapid, reliable, on-time delivery and customer pickup throughout the United States and Canada. 
 6

   Additionally, we believe our highly integrated, best-in-class technology provides leading e-commerce and integrated workflow capabilities for our customers, while providing us unparalleled pricing, budgeting, reporting and analytical capabilities across our Company. We believe customers view us as an integral part of the value chain due to our extensive product knowledge, expansive product availability and the ability to directly integrate with their systems and workflows. 
   Our Strategy 
         Since 2007 we have undertaken significant operating and growth initiatives at all levels. We developed and are implementing a multi-year strategy to optimize our business mix. This strategy includes entering new markets and product lines, streamlining and upgrading our process and technology capabilities, acquiring new capabilities and optimizing our portfolio of businesses. At the same time, we attracted what we believe to be "best of the best" talent, capitalizing on relevant experience, teamwork and change navigation. 
         Each of our businesses invest in high-growth initiatives that align with our five growth plays: 
 

1.Sell
More to Existing Customers (i.e., Share of Wallet)
2.Introduce
New Products and Services
3.Expand
the Channels to Reach Our Customers (e.g., Internet, Catalog, and Mobility)
4.Acquire
New Customers
5.Enter
New Geographies (i.e., Open New Locations) 

         Through investments in these growth plays, we believe we are well-positioned to grow in excess of the markets in which we operate. Specific initiatives focus on increasing penetration within our existing customer base, including the addition of new sales talent across the Company and a training facility for our Waterworks business to ensure we continue to have a highly trained sales force; and the addition of new products and services, including proprietary brands, primarily in our Facilities Maintenance business. We also continue to invest in mobile technologies and e-commerce. We focus primarily on sales talent acquisition and entering new geographies to acquire new customers. 
         HD Supply is managed primarily on a product-line basis and reports results of operations in three reportable segments. The reportable segments are Facilities Maintenance, Waterworks, and Construction & Industrial. In addition, the consolidated financial statements include Corporate, which comprises enterprise-wide functional departments that operate in a centralized structure. 
  Facilities Maintenance.    Facilities Maintenance distributes MRO products, provides value-add services and fabricates custom products. Our Facilities Maintenance business unit serves the owners of multifamily, hospitality, healthcare and institutional facilities. Products include electrical and lighting items, plumbing, HVAC products, appliances, janitorial supplies, hardware, kitchen and bath cabinets, window coverings, textiles and guest amenities, healthcare maintenance and water and wastewater treatment products. Facilities Maintenance operates a distribution center-based model that sells its products primarily through a professional sales force, e-commerce and print catalogs. 
  Waterworks.    Waterworks distributes complete lines of water and wastewater transmission products, serving contractors and municipalities in the water and wastewater industries for non-residential and residential uses. Our Waterworks business unit serves non-residential, residential, water systems, sewage systems and other markets. Waterworks reaches customers through a nationwide network of regionally organized branches and operates a bid-based model, primarily for municipal projects. Products include pipes, fittings, valves, hydrants and meters for use in the construction, maintenance and repair of water and waste-water systems as well as fire-protection systems. Waterworks has complemented its core products through additional offerings, including smart meters (AMR/AMI), fusible piping solutions and 
 7

   specific engineered treatment plant products and services. Waterworks' services and capabilities allow us to integrate with our customers and form part of their sourcing and procurement function. 
  Construction & Industrial.    Construction & Industrial distributes specialized hardware, tools, engineered materials and safety products to non-residential and residential contractors. Service offerings range from pre-bid assistance and product submittals to engineering and tool repair. Construction & Industrial reaches customers through a nationwide network of regionally organized branches as well as print catalogs and e-commerce. Products include tilt-up brace systems, forming and shoring systems, concrete chemicals, hand and power tools, cutting tools, rebar, ladders, safety and fall arrest equipment, specialty screws and fasteners, sealants and adhesives, drainage pipe, geo-synthetics, erosion and sediment control equipment and other engineered materials used broadly across all types of non-residential and residential construction. Construction & Industrial also includes Home Improvement Solutions, which offers light remodeling and construction supplies, kitchen and bath cabinets, windows, plumbing materials, electrical equipment and other products, primarily to small remodeling contractors and trade professionals through local retail outlets. 
         Corporate.    In addition to the reportable segments, our consolidated financial results include "Corporate" which includes costs related to our centralized support functions, which are comprised of finance, information technology, human resources, legal, supply chain and other support services, and removes inter-segment transactions. 
   Our Market Sectors 
         We offer a diverse range of products and services to the Maintenance, Repair & Operations, Infrastructure and Specialty Construction market sectors in the United States and Canada. The markets in which we operate have a high degree of customer and supplier fragmentation, with customers that typically demand a high level of service and availability of a broad set of complex products from a large number of suppliers. These market dynamics make the distributor a critical element within the value chain. Net sales for HD Supply outside of the United States, primarily in Canada, were $124 million, $125 million, and $130 million in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2014, respectively. 
 Maintenance, Repair & Operations 
         In the Maintenance, Repair & Operations market sector, our Facilities Maintenance and Home Improvement Solutions businesses serve customers across multiple industries by primarily delivering supplies and services needed to maintain and upgrade multifamily, hospitality, healthcare and institutional facilities. Facilities Maintenance is a distribution center-based model, while Home Improvement Solutions (included in the Construction & Industrial reportable segment) operates through retail outlets primarily serving cash and carry customers. We estimate that this market sector currently represents an addressable market in excess of $51 billion annually with demand driven primarily by ongoing maintenance requirements of a broad range of existing structures and traditional repair and remodeling construction activity across multiple industries. We believe Facilities Maintenance customers value speed and product availability over price. We believe our maintenance, repair and operations business focused on living spaces, including apartment units, hotel or motel rooms and senior care living facilities, provides stable demand, particularly in a challenging economic environment, when new construction tends to decrease. 
 Infrastructure 
         In the Infrastructure market sector, our Waterworks business unit supports both established infrastructure and new projects by meeting demand for critical supplies and services used to build and maintain water systems. We estimate that this market sector currently represents an addressable market in excess of $11 billion annually with demand in the United States driven primarily by an aging and 
 8

   overburdened national infrastructure and general population growth trends. The broad geographic presence of our Waterworks business unit, through a regionally organized branch distribution network, reduces our exposure to economic factors in any single region. We believe we have the potential to capitalize on a substantial backlog of deferred projects that will need to be addressed in the coming years as a result of our customers delaying much needed upgrades or repairs during the recent economic downturn as well as a continued recovery in the non-residential and residential construction markets. 
   Specialty Construction 
         In the Specialty Construction market sector, our Construction & Industrial business unit serves professional contractors and trades by meeting their distinct and customized supply needs in non-residential, residential and industrial applications. We estimate that this market sector currently represents an addressable market of approximately $25 billion annually with demand driven primarily by residential construction, non-residential construction, industrial and repair and remodeling construction spending. Construction & Industrial serves this sector through the broad national presence of its regionally organized branch distribution network, as well as branches in six Canadian provinces. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the continued recovery from historical lows within the non-residential and residential construction end-markets. 
 Our History 
         In March 1997, Home Depot, the former parent of our operating subsidiaries, acquired Maintenance Warehouse / America Corp., a Texas corporation organized on January 26, 1985, and a leading direct marketer of MRO products to the hospitality and multifamily housing markets. Since 1997, our business has grown rapidly, primarily through the acquisition of more than 40 businesses. 
         From fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2004, we extended our presence into new categories while growing existing businesses through 10 acquisitions. New businesses included plumbing and HVAC (through the acquisition of Apex Supply), flooring products and installation (Floors, Inc., Floorworks, Inc., and Arvada Hardwood Floor Company) and specialty hardware, tools and materials for construction contractors (White Cap). Growth at existing businesses was driven organically and through "tuck-in" acquisitions, expanding our presence in the MRO market sector (N-E Thing Supply and Economy Maintenance Supply) and flooring and design services for professional homebuilders (Creative Touch Interiors). 
         In fiscal 2005, we accelerated the pace of consolidation by acquiring 18 businesses, the largest of which was National Waterworks, a leading distributor of products used to build, repair and maintain water and wastewater transmission systems. In fiscal 2006, we transformed our business with the acquisition of Hughes Supply, which doubled our Net sales and further established our market leadership in a number of our largest business units, which we supplemented with 11 other strategic acquisitions. 
         In 2007, investment funds associated with the Equity Sponsors formed Holdings and purchased HDS and the Canadian subsidiary CND Holdings, Inc. from Home Depot. In connection with the 2007 Transactions, Home Depot obtained a 12.5% interest in the then outstanding common stock of Holdings. 
         Since 2007, we have focused on extending our presence in key growth sectors and exiting less attractive sectors. In February 2008, we sold our Lumber and Building Materials operations to ProBuild Holdings. In June 2009, we purchased substantially all of the assets of ORCO Construction Supply, the second largest construction materials distributor in the U.S., through Construction & Industrial. In February 2011, we sold all of the assets of SESCO/QUESCO, an electrical products division of HD Supply Canada, to Sonepar Canada. In May 2011, we purchased all of the assets of RAMSCO, 
 9

   expanding Waterworks in upstate New York. In September 2011, we sold our Plumbing/HVAC operations to Hajoca Corporation. In March 2012, we sold our IPVF business to Shale-Inland Holdings LLC. In June 2012, we acquired Peachtree, which specializes in customizable business and property marketing supplies, to enhance Facilities Maintenance. In December 2012, we purchased substantially all of the assets of Water Products, expanding the geographic footprint of Waterworks. 
         On July 2, 2013, Holdings completed an initial public offering of 61,170,212 shares of its common stock at a price of $18.00 per share, for an aggregate offering price of $1,039 million, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions and offering expenses of approximately $16 million. 
         During fiscal 2014, we completed the disposal of Litemor through liquidation. In January 2015, we sold substantially all of the assets of our Hardware Solutions business to Home Depot. In October 2015, we sold our Power Solutions business to Anixter Inc. In May 2016, we sold our Interior Solutions business to Interior Specialists, Inc. For additional information on the discontinued operations, see Note 2, "Discontinued Operations," within "Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
         Upon completion of Holdings' secondary public offerings in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, the Equity Sponsors and Home Depot sold all of their remaining original investment in Holdings. 
   Customers and Suppliers 
         We maintain a customer base of approximately 530,000 customers, many of whom represent long-term relationships. We are subject to very low customer concentration with our ten largest customers generating approximately 7.8% of our Net sales in fiscal 2016, reducing our exposure to any single customer. 
         We have developed relationships with approximately 9,000 strategic suppliers, many of which are long-standing. These supplier relationships provide us with reliable access to inventory, volume purchasing benefits and the ability to deliver a diverse product offering on a cost-effective basis. We maintain multiple suppliers for a substantial number of our products, thereby limiting the risk of product shortage for customers. 
   Competition 
         We operate in a highly fragmented industry and hold leading positions in multiple market sectors. Competition, including from our competitors and specific competitive factors, varies for each market sector. The majority of our competition comes from mid-size regional distributors and small, local distributors; however, we also face competition from a number of national competitors, including Fastenal, Grainger, MSC Industrial, Watsco, Interline Brands (a Division of Home Depot) and Ferguson (a Division of Wolseley plc). 
         We believe the principal competitive factors for our market sectors include local selling capabilities, availability, breadth and cost of materials and supplies, technical knowledge and expertise, value-add service capabilities, customer and supplier relationships, reliability and accuracy of service, effective use of technology, delivery capabilities and timeliness, pricing of products, and the provision of credit. We believe that our competitive strengths and strategy allow us to compete effectively in our market sectors. 
   Seasonality 
         In a typical year, our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Historically, sales of our products have been higher in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year due to favorable weather and longer daylight conditions during these periods. Seasonal variations in operating results may also 
 10

   be significantly impacted by inclement weather conditions, such as cold or wet weather, which can delay construction projects and customer deliveries.

   Intellectual property 
         Our trademarks and those of our subsidiaries are registered or otherwise legally protected in the United States, Canada and elsewhere. We, together with our subsidiaries, own approximately 160 trademarks registered worldwide. We also rely upon trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect intellectual property rights through a variety of methods, including trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws, in addition to confidentiality agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who have access to our proprietary information. Generally, registered trademarks have a perpetual life, provided that they are renewed on a timely basis and continue to be used properly as trademarks. We intend to maintain our material trademark registrations so long as they remain valuable to our business. Other than the trademarks HD Supply ®, USABluebook ®, Seasons ®, Brigade ®, Maintenance Warehouse ® and White Cap ®, we do not believe our business is dependent to a material degree on trademarks, patents, copyrights or trade secrets. Other than commercially available software licenses, we do not believe that any of our licenses for third-party intellectual property are material to our business, taken as a whole. See "Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our BusinessIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, or we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our ability to compete could be negatively impacted." 
   Employees 
         In domestic and international operations, we had approximately 14,000 employees as of January 29, 2017, consisting of approximately 9,000 hourly personnel and approximately 5,000 salaried employees. 
 11

           As of January 29, 2017, less than one percent of our hourly workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
   Regulation 
         Our operations are affected by various statutes, regulations and laws in the markets in which we operate, which historically have not had a material effect on our business. While we are not engaged in a regulated industry, we are subject to various laws applicable to businesses generally, including laws affecting land usage, zoning, the environment, health and safety, transportation, labor and employment practices (including pensions), competition, immigration and other matters. Additionally, building codes may affect the products our customers are allowed to use, and consequently, changes in building codes may affect the saleability of our products. The transportation and disposal of many of our products are also subject to federal regulations. The DOT regulates our operations in domestic interstate commerce. We are subject to safety requirements governing interstate operations prescribed by the DOT. Vehicle dimensions and driver hours of service also remain subject to both federal and state regulation. See "Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our BusinessOur costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in U.S. federal, state or local regulations." 
 Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
         We are subject to a broad range of foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those pertaining to air emissions, water discharges, the handling, disposal and transport of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, the investigation and remediation of contamination and otherwise relating to health and safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources. As our operations, and those of many of the companies we have acquired, to a limited extent involve and have involved the handling, transport and distribution of materials that are, or could be classified as, toxic or hazardous, there is some risk of contamination and environmental damage inherent in our operations and the products we handle, transport and distribute. Our environmental, health and safety liabilities and obligations may result in significant capital expenditures and other costs, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be fined or penalized by regulators for failing to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, or we may be held responsible for such failures by companies we have acquired. In addition, contamination resulting from our current or past operations, and those of many of the companies we have acquired, may trigger investigation or remediation obligations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
