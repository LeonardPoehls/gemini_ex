Item 1 – Business.
General
The Hillman Companies, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “Hillman” or “Company”) are one of the largest providers of hardware-related products and related merchandising services to retail markets in North America. Our principal business is operated through our wholly-owned subsidiary, The Hillman Group, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “Hillman Group”), which had net sales of approximately $814.9 million in 2016. Hillman Group sells its products to hardware stores, home centers, mass merchants, pet supply stores, and other retail outlets principally in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Product lines include thousands of small parts such as fasteners and related hardware items; threaded rod and metal shapes; keys, key duplication systems, and accessories; builder's hardware; and identification items, such as tags and letters, numbers, and signs. We support product sales with services that include design and installation of merchandising systems and maintenance of appropriate in-store inventory levels.
Our headquarters are located at 10590 Hamilton Avenue, Cincinnati, Ohio. We maintain a website at www.hillmangroup.com. Information contained or linked on our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report and should not be considered a part of this annual report.
Background
On June 30, 2014, affiliates of CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC (“CCMP”) and Oak Hill Capital Partners III, L.P., Oak Hill Capital Management Partners III, L.P., and OHCP III HC RO, L.P. (collectively, “Oak Hill Funds”), together with certain current and former members of Hillman's management, consummated a merger transaction (the “Merger Transaction”) pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of May 16, 2014. As a result of the Merger Transaction, The Hillman Companies, Inc. remained a wholly-owned subsidiary of OHCP HM Acquisition Corp., which changed its name to HMAN Intermediate II Holdings Corp. (“Predecessor Holdco”), and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of HMAN Group Holdings Inc. (“Successor Holdco” or “Holdco”). The total consideration paid in the Merger Transaction was approximately $1.5 billion including repayment of outstanding debt and including the value of our outstanding Junior Subordinated Debentures ($105.4 million liquidation value at the time of the Merger Transaction).

Hillman Group
We are organized as five separate business segments, the largest of which is (1) Hillman Group operating primarily in the United States. The other business segments consist of subsidiaries of the Hillman Group operating in (2) Canada under the names The Hillman Group Canada ULC and H. Paulin & Co., (3) Mexico under the name SunSource Integrated Services de Mexico S.A. de C.V., (4) Florida under the name All Points Industries, and (5) Australia under the name The Hillman Group Australia Pty. Ltd. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we decided to exit the Australia market following the withdrawal from Australia of a key customer and recorded charges of $1.0 million related to the write-off of inventory and other assets.
We provide merchandising services and products such as fasteners and related hardware items; threaded rod and metal shapes; keys, key duplication systems, and accessories; builder's hardware; and identification items, such as tags and letters, numbers, and signs, to retail outlets, primarily hardware stores, home centers and mass merchants, pet supply stores, grocery stores, and drug stores. We complement our extensive product selection with regular retailer visits by our field sales and service organization.
We market and distribute approximately 114,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”) of small, hard-to-find and hard-to-manage hardware items. We function as a category manager for retailers and support these products with in-store service, high order fill rates, and rapid delivery of products sold. Sales and service representatives regularly visit retail outlets to review stock levels, reorder items in need of replacement, and interact with the store management to offer new product and merchandising ideas. Thousands of items can be actively managed with the retailer experiencing a substantial reduction of in-store labor costs and replenishment paperwork. Service representatives also assist in organizing the products in a consumer-friendly manner. We complement our broad range of products with merchandising services such as displays, product identification stickers, retail price labels, store rack and drawer systems, assistance in rack positioning and store layout, and inventory restocking services. We regularly refresh retailers' displays with new products and package designs utilizing color-coding to simplify the shopping experience for consumers and improve the attractiveness of individual store displays.
We operate from 19 strategically located distribution centers in the United States, Canada, and Mexico and are recognized for providing retailers with industry leading fill-rates and lead times. Our main distribution centers utilize state-of-the-art warehouse management systems (“WMS”) to ship customer orders within 48 hours while achieving a very high order fill rate. We utilize third-party logistics providers to warehouse and ship customer orders in the U.S., Mexico, and Australia.
We also design, manufacture, and market industry-leading identification and duplication equipment for home, office, automotive, and specialty keys. In 2000, we revolutionized the key duplication market with the patent-protected Axxess Key Duplication System™ which provided the ability to accurately identify and duplicate a key to store associates with little or no experience. In 2007, we upgraded our key duplication technology with Precision Laser Key™ utilizing innovative digital and laser imaging to identify a key and duplicate the cut-pattern automatically. In 2011, we introduced the innovative FastKey™ consumer-operated key duplication system which utilizes technology from the Precision Laser Key System™. In 2016, we delivered our most innovative and effective key duplication equipment with the introduction of KeyKrafter™. The KeyKrafter™ provides significant reduction in duplication time while increasing accuracy and ease of use. Through our creative use of technology and efficient use of inventory management systems, the sale of our products have proven to be a profitable revenue source for big box retailers. Our duplication systems have been placed in over 25,000 retail locations to date and are supported by our sales and service representatives.
In addition, we supply a variety of innovative options of consumer-operated vending systems for engraving specialty items such as pet identification tags, luggage tags, and other engraved identification tags. We have developed unique engraving systems leveraging state-of-the-art technologies to provide a customized solution for mass merchant and pet supply retailers. To date, approximately 10,000 of our engraving systems have been placed in retail locations which are also supported by our sales and service representatives.
Products and Suppliers
Our vast product portfolio is recognized by top retailers across North America for providing consistent quality and innovation to DIYers and professional contractors. Our product strategy concentrates on providing total project solutions for common and unique home improvement projects. Our portfolio provides retailers the assurance that their shoppers can find the right product at the right price within an ‘easy to shop' environment.
We currently manage a worldwide supply chain of approximately 800 vendors, the largest of which accounted for approximately 4.3% of the Company's annual purchases and the top five of which accounted for approximately 18% of its 
3

annual purchases. Our vendor quality control procedures include on-site evaluations and frequent product testing. Vendors are also evaluated based on delivery performance and the accuracy of their shipments.
Fasteners
Fasteners remain the core of our business and the product line encompasses what we believe to be one of the largest selections among suppliers servicing the hardware retail segment. The fastener line includes standard and specialty nuts, bolts, washers, screws, anchors, and picture hanging items. We offer zinc, chrome, and galvanized plated steel fasteners in addition to stainless steel, brass, and nylon fasteners in this vast line of products. In addition, we carry a complete line of indoor and outdoor project fasteners for use with drywall and deck construction.
We keep the fastener category vibrant and refreshed for retailers by providing a continuous stream of new products. Some of our recent offerings include an expansion of Hillman's WeatherMaxx™ stainless steel fasteners. We believe that the fast-growing category provides consumers with value and performance in exterior applications and incremental margins for retailers. WeatherMaxx™ features a variety of packaging options to assist consumers to find the right quantity for large or small projects. In addition, the Tite-Series marks our expansion into the fast growing and highly profitable construction fastener segment. The Tite-Series features fasteners for common new construction and remodeling projects such as deck building, roof repair, landscaping, and gutter repair. We believe that the Tite-Series offers enhanced performance with an easy-start, type 17 bit, serrated threads, and reduced torque requirements. The program also features an innovative new merchandising format which we believe allows retailers to increase holding power while displaying products in a neat and organized system.
In 2015, we continued to expand a new line of hand driven nails, deck screws, and drywall screws. The new program features a comprehensive offering for DIYers and professional contractors across a good, better, best value platform. The program is marketed under the prominent Hillman brand and introduces three new categories: Fas-N-Tite, DeckPlus, and PowerPro, allowing shoppers to choose their desired quality level. Our new offering was the result of extensive consumer research and contains proprietary performance features that we believe will positively influence end-users' purchase decision. The packaging and merchandising utilizes large product images, impactful graphics, and mounted product samples so that shoppers can easily navigate the display and locate items quickly. 
We expanded our mass merchant fastener program in over 3,500 stores across the U.S. The line targets consumers visiting mass merchants, grocery, and department stores who desire to purchase their hardware needs while shopping for grocery and general merchandise needs. The product offering provides convenience to the light-duty DIYer and solutions to common home improvement projects. The program utilizes our proven packaging and merchandising best practices that simplify consumers' shopping experience. We believe that this new line is among the most comprehensive and innovative in this market segment which is growing in popularity due to busy consumers who prefer one-stop shopping superstores.
In 2016, we continued to expand our fastener presence beyond retailers' ‘brick and mortar' locations by supporting the e-commerce segment. We supported e-commerce requests and now have over 25,000 items available for sale on retailers' websites. We supported direct-to-store and direct-to-consumer fulfillment for consumers who choose to order fasteners directly from retailers' websites. Consumers can visit the retailer's website, select their desired fasteners, pay by credit card, and pick up their order at the retailer's store or choose to have the order shipped to the address of the consumer's choice. We continue to support retailers' requests to expand their on-line offerings in 2017.
Fasteners generated approximately 64.3% of our total revenues in 2016, as compared to 65.8% in 2015 and 64.5% in 2014.
Keys and Key Accessories
We design and manufacture proprietary equipment which forms the cornerstone for our key duplication business. Our key duplication system is offered in various retail channels including mass merchants, home centers, automotive parts retailers, franchise and independent (“F&I”) hardware stores, and grocery/drug chains; it can also be found in many service-based businesses like parcel shipping outlets.
We market multiple separate key duplication systems. The Axxess Precision Key Duplication System™ is marketed to national retailers requiring a key duplication program easily mastered by novice associates, while the Hillman Key Program targets the F&I hardware retailers with a machine that works well in businesses with lower turnover and highly skilled employees. There are over 25,000 Axxess Programs placed in North American retailers including Home Depot, Lowe's, and Walmart.
We introduced the Precision Laser Key System™ in 2007. This system uses a digital optical camera, lasers, and proprietary software to scan a customer's key. The system identifies the key and retrieves the key's specifications, including the appropriate blank and cutting pattern, from a comprehensive database. This technology automates nearly every aspect of key duplication 
4

and provides the ability for every store associate to cut a key accurately. We have placed approximately 2,900 of these key duplicating systems in North American retailers and we believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on this technology.
In 2011, we launched the innovative FastKey™ consumer-operated key duplication system with Walmart in 1,000 high volume stores. FastKey™ utilizes technology from the Precision Laser Key System™ and combines a consumer-friendly vending system which allows retail shoppers to duplicate the most popular home, office, and small lock keys. The FastKey™ system covers a large percentage of the key market and features a unique key sleeve that ensures proper insertion, alignment, and duplication of the key. Consumers who attempt to duplicate keys not included in the FastKey™ system receive a ‘service slip' identifying their key and referring them to the main Hillman key cutting location within the store. The FastKey™ system has demonstrated the ability to increase overall key sales at the store retail level.
In 2016, we delivered our most innovative and effective key duplication equipment with the introduction of KeyKrafter™. The KeyKrafter™ provides significant reduction in duplication time while increasing accuracy and ease of use. 
In addition to key duplication, we have an exclusive, strategic partnership with Sid Tool Co., Inc. (acting through its Class C Solutions Group) for the distribution of the proprietary PC+© Code Cutter machine which produces automobile keys based on a vehicle's identification number. The Code Cutter machines are marketed to automotive dealerships, auto rental agencies, and various companies with truck and vehicle fleets. Since its introduction, over 7,900 PC+© units and over 9,100 of the newer Flash Code Cutter units have been sold.
We also market keys and key accessories in conjunction with our duplication systems. Our proprietary key offering features the universal blank which uses a "universal" keyway to replace up to five original equipment keys. This innovative system allows a retailer to duplicate 99% of the key market while stocking less than 100 SKUs. We continually refresh the retailer's key offering by introducing decorated and licensed keys and accessories. Our Wackey™ and Fanatix™ lines feature decorative themes of art and popular licenses such as NFL, Disney, Breast Cancer Awareness, M&M's, and Harley Davidson to increase the purchase frequency and average transaction value per key. We also market a successful line of decorative and licensed lanyards. We have taken the key and key accessory categories from a price sensitive commodity to a fashion driven business and have significantly increased retail pricing and gross margins.
Keys, key accessories, and Code Cutter units represented approximately 14.8% of our total revenues in 2016, as compared to 15.6% in 2015 and 16.6% in 2014.
Engraving
Our engraving business focuses on the growing consumer spending trends surrounding personalized and pet identification. Innovation has played a major role in the development of our engraving business unit. From the original Quick-Tag™ consumer-operated vending system to the proprietary laser system of TagWorks, we continue to lead the industry with consumer-friendly engraving solutions.
Quick-Tag™ is a patented, consumer-operated vending system that custom engraves and dispenses pet identification tags, military-style I.D. tags, holiday ornaments, and luggage tags. Styles include NFL and NCAA logo military tags. Quick-Tag™ is an easy, convenient means for the consumer to custom-engrave tags and generates attractive margins for the retailer. We have placed over 4,700 Quick-Tag™ machines in retail outlets throughout the U.S. and Canada. In addition to placements in retail outlets, we have placed machines inside theme parks such as Disney, Sea World, and Universal Studios.
In 2010, we launched the next generation engraving platform with our new FIDO™ system. This new engraving program integrates a fun attractive design with a user interface that provides new features for the consumer. The individual tag is packaged in a mini cassette and the machine's mechanism flips the tag to allow engraving on both sides. The user interface features a loveable dog character that guides the consumer through the engraving process. We have placed approximately 3,100 FIDO™ systems in PETCO stores as of December 31, 2016.
In 2011, we acquired the innovative TagWorks engraving system featuring patented technology, unique product portfolio, and attractive off-board merchandising. The TagWorks system utilizes laser printing technology and allows consumers to watch the engraving process. The off-board merchandising allows premium-priced tags to be displayed in store-front locations and is effective at increasing the average price per transaction.
We design, manufacture, and assemble the engraving equipment in our Tempe, Arizona facility. Engraving products represented approximately 6.8% of our total revenues in 2016, as compared to 6.5% in 2015 and 6.7% in 2014.

Letters, Numbers, and Signs
Letters, numbers, and signs (“LNS”) includes product lines that target both the homeowner and commercial user. Product lines within this category include individual and/or packaged letters, numbers, signs, safety related products (e.g., 911 signs), driveway markers, and a diversity of sign accessories, such as sign frames.
Through a series of strategic acquisitions, exclusive partnerships, and organic product developments, we have created an LNS program which gives retailers one of the largest product offerings available in this category. This SKU intensive product category is considered a staple for retail hardware departments and is typically merchandised in eight linear feet of retail space containing hundreds of SKUs. In addition to the core product program, we provide our customers with retail support including custom plan-o-grams and merchandising solutions.
We have demonstrated the continual launch of new products to match the needs of DIY and commercial end-users. We recently introduced popular programs such as high-end address plaques and numbers, the custom create-a-sign program, and commercial signs.
Our LNS program can be found in big box retailers, mass merchants, and pet supply accounts. In addition, we have product placement in F&I hardware retailers.
The LNS category represented approximately 4.8% of our total revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Threaded Rod
We are a leading supplier of metal shapes and threaded rod in the retail market. The SteelWorks™ threaded rod product includes hot and cold rolled rod, both weld-able and plated, as well as a complete offering of All-Thread rod in galvanized steel, stainless steel, and brass.
The SteelWorks™ program is carried by many top retailers, including Lowe's and Menards, and through cooperatives such as Ace Hardware. In addition, we are the primary supplier of metal shapes to many wholesalers throughout the country.
Threaded rod generated approximately 4.6% of our total revenues in 2016, as compared to 4.2% in 2015 and 4.5% in 2014.
Builder's Hardware
The builder's hardware category includes a variety of common household items such as coat hooks, door stops, hinges, gate latches, hasps, and decorative hardware.
We market the builder's hardware products under the Hardware Essentials™ brand and provide the retailer with an innovative merchandising solution. The Hardware Essentials™ program utilizes modular packaging, color coding, and integrated merchandising to simplify the shopping experience for consumers. Colorful signs, packaging, and installation instructions guide the consumer quickly and easily to the correct product location. Hardware Essentials™ provides retailers and consumers decorative upgrade opportunities through the introduction of high-end finishes such as satin nickel, pewter, and antique bronze.
The combination of merchandising, upgraded finishes, and product breadth is designed to improve the retailer's performance. The addition of the builder's hardware product line exemplifies our strategy of leveraging our core competencies to further penetrate customer accounts with new product offerings. In 2016, we expanded the placement of the Hardware Essentials™ line in the F&I channel. The F&I channel provided successful conversions in over 400 new locations in 2016.
As of December 31, 2016, the Hardware Essentials™ line was placed in over 3,600 retail locations and generated approximately 4.7% of our total revenues in 2016, as compared to 3.1% in 2015 and 2.9% in 2014.
Markets and Customers
We sell our products to national accounts such as Lowe's, Home Depot, Walmart, Tractor Supply, Menards, PetSmart, and PETCO. Our status as a national supplier of proprietary products to big box retailers allows us to develop a strong market position and high barriers to entry within our product categories.
We service more than 15,000 F&I retail outlets. These individual dealers are typically members of the larger cooperatives, such as True Value, Ace Hardware, and Do-It-Best. We ship directly to the cooperative's retail locations and also supply many items to the cooperative's central warehouses. These central warehouses distribute to their members that do not have a requirement for 
6

Hillman's in-store service. These arrangements reduce credit risk and logistic expenses for us while also reducing central warehouse inventory and delivery costs for the cooperatives.
A typical hardware store maintains thousands of different items in inventory, many of which generate small dollar sales but large profits. It is difficult for a retailer to economically monitor all stock levels and to reorder the products from multiple vendors. This problem is compounded by the necessity of receiving small shipments of inventory at different times and stocking the goods. The failure to have these small items available will have an adverse effect on store traffic, thereby possibly denying the retailer the opportunity to sell items that generate higher dollar sales.
We sell our products to approximately 26,000 customers, the top five of which accounted for approximately $441.9 million of our total revenue in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Lowe's was the single largest customer, representing approximately $173.5 million of our total revenues, Home Depot was the second largest at approximately $137.5 million, and Walmart was the third largest at approximately $64.5 million of our total revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 5.0% of total revenue in 2016. In each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we derived over 10% of our total revenues from Lowe's and Home Depot which operated in the following segments: United States excluding All Points, All Points, Canada, and Mexico.
Our telemarketing activity sells to thousands of smaller hardware outlets and non-hardware accounts. We are also pursuing new business internationally in such places as Canada, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. See Note 17 - Segment Reporting and Geographic Information, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sales and Marketing
We provide product support, customer service, and high profit margins for our retail distribution partners. We believe that our competitive advantage is in our ability to provide a greater level of customer service than our competitors.
Service is the hallmark of Hillman company-wide. The national accounts field service organization consists of approximately 535 employees and 40 field managers focusing on big box retailers, pet super stores, large national discount chains, and grocery stores. This organization reorders products, details store shelves, and sets up in-store promotions. Many of our largest customers use electronic data interchange (“EDI”) for handling of orders and invoices.
We employ what we believe to be the largest direct sales force in the industry. The sales force, which consists of approximately 220 employees and is managed by 22 field managers, focuses on the F&I customers. The depth of the sales and service team enables us to maintain consistent call cycles ensuring that all customers experience proper stock levels and inventory turns. This team also prepares custom plan-o-grams of displays to fit the needs of any store and establishes programs that meet customers' requirements for pricing, invoicing, and other needs. This group also benefits from daily internal support from our inside sales and customer service teams. On average, each sales representative is responsible for approximately 58 full service accounts that the sales representative calls on approximately every two weeks.
These efforts, coupled with those of the marketing department, allow the sales force to sell and support our product lines. Our marketing department provides support through the development of new products and categories, sales collateral material, promotional items, merchandising aids, and custom signage. Marketing services such as advertising, graphic design, and trade show management are also provided to the sales force. The department is organized along our three marketing competencies: product management, channel marketing, and marketing communications.
Competition
Our primary competitors in the national accounts marketplace for fasteners are Illinois Tool Works Inc., Dorman Products Inc., Midwest Fastener Corporation, Primesource Building Products, Inc, and competition from direct import by our customers. Competition is based primarily on in-store service and price. Other competitors are local and regional distributors. Competitors in the pet tag market are specialty retailers, direct mail order, and retailers with in-store mail order capability. The Quick-Tag™, FIDO™, and TagWorks systems have patent protected technology that is a major barrier to entry and helps to preserve this market segment.
The principal competitors for our F&I business are Midwest Fastener and Hy-Ko Products Company (“Hy-Ko”) in the hardware store marketplace. Midwest Fastener primarily focuses on fasteners, while Hy-Ko is the major competitor in LNS products and keys/key accessories. The hardware outlets that purchase our products without regularly scheduled sales representative visits may also purchase products from local and regional distributors and cooperatives. We compete primarily on field service, merchandising, as well as product availability, price, and depth of product line.

Insurance Arrangements
Under our current insurance programs, commercial umbrella coverage is obtained for catastrophic exposure and aggregate losses in excess of expected claims. Since 1991, we have retained the exposure on certain expected losses related to workers' compensation, general liability, and automobile. We also retain the exposure on expected losses related to health benefits of certain employees. We believe that our present insurance is adequate for our businesses. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 3,045 full time and part time employees, none of which were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. In our opinion, employee relations are good.
Backlog
We do not consider the sales backlog to be a significant indicator of future performance due to the short order cycle of our business. Our sales backlog from ongoing operations was approximately $9.0 million as of December 31, 2016 and approximately $8.9 million as of December 31, 2015. We expect to realize the entire December 31, 2016 backlog during 2017.
