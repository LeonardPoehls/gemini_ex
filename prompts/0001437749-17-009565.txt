ITEM 1: BUSINESS
 
We are a Delaware corporation that develops, manufactures and sells nano lithium titanate (“nLTO”) materials, batteries and energy storage systems (referred to as “ESS” or by our brand name “ALTI-ESS”). Our nano lithium titanate battery systems offer higher power density, longer cycle life, rapid charge and discharge capabilities, a wider operating temperature range and higher levels of safety than conventional lithium-ion batteries. We target applications that effectively utilize the key attributes of our technology, and these applications can be found primarily in the electric grid, transportation (commercial vehicles), and industrial market segments.

             Since 2012, we have focused on transitioning our operations from the United States to China. As of December 31, 2016, we have in place a phase three nLTO production line with an annual production capacity of 3,500 metric tons. 
 
We do not currently manufacture our batteries, but our Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) cell producer’s capacity can reach 70,000 Altair format cells per year. Sometime in the future, we expect to validate another OEM cell producer to reduce dependency on one supplier, which we expect will provide competition between suppliers and reduce our costs. We also have in place two operational battery module production lines with a total capacity of approximately 6,000 modules per year. As of the date of this Report, we manufacture all of our products in China and sell all of our products from China. 
 
By building manufacturing and assembly facilities in Wu’an, China for our nLTO material, modules and soon our energy storage systems, we have centered the whole supply chain in China. In adopting this strategy, we expect to achieve:
 

■ | Reduction of production costs
--+------------------------------


■ | Better quality control

Primary Products and Target Energy Markets
 
Primary Products
 
We have developed, and continue to develop, through our primary materials science research, a lithium-ion battery chemistry using nanotechnologies to create materials offering unique electrochemistry properties for rechargeable batteries. We refer to this material as nano lithium titanate, or nLTO, and it is applied to the battery anode. Our nLTO battery cells offer 5 to 11 times greater cycle life than conventional lithium-ion technologies, an ability to rapidly discharge and charge, an ability to operate in extremely cold and hot temperatures, and a greater margin of safety than conventional lithium-ion technologies. Our Gen 4 products have improved on these aspects. Our nLTO batteries are designed to focus on high power applications, and are ideally suited for fast response applications in the electric grid segment for grid stability, hybrid and all-electric vehicles, and industrial applications.

Target Energy Related Markets
 
Transportation (Commercial Vehicles)
 
Large cities, counties and transit authorities are increasingly turning to electric and hybrid EV Buses to reduce pollution and reliance on diesel fuel for their transportation systems, especially in markets like China where there are significant levels of pollution. Commercial vehicle manufacturers, including medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks, are likewise evaluating hybrid systems to improve fuel economy and in some instances run battery-only systems at low speeds. At this stage of the market development, electric and hybrid electric vehicles generally cost more than their conventional counterparts, although the upfront cost may be offset by lower operating costs and a potentially longer operating life. Proterra, a U.S based EV Bus manufacturer had one of its all-EV Buses using our batteries tested at the Altoona Test Track by Penn State University and demonstrated a 17.5 to 29.5 miles per gallon (mpg) fuel equivalent vs. a normal diesel bus that achieved under 4 mpg. This difference translates into a fuel savings of about $350,000 over the life of the bus assuming a fuel cost of $3.50 per gallon. This is in addition to the savings in maintenance costs over the life of the bus, as a result of fewer mechanical systems and moving parts to maintain. We believe that cities, counties and commercial vehicle operators are willing to accept the higher upfront costs in order to benefit from the expected savings in long-term operating costs and potentially longer operating life, as well as the environmental benefits. 
 
Electric and hybrid-electric commercial vehicles require a significant amount of power, operate throughout the day, have a long-expected life and run in extreme temperature ranges. The relative strengths of our nLTO batteries, including the high levels of power, rapid charge and discharge rates, long cycle life and ability to function at temperature extremes, are particularly well suited for electric and hybrid commercial vehicles, giving us what we believe is a compelling competitive advantage in this market.

With the growing concern regarding the release of pollutants associated with burning fossil fuels, the attractiveness of all electric and hybrid EV Buses is rapidly growing. We are attempting to establish our nLTO batteries as the power source of choice in this emerging market. Given the projected growth of EV Buses in the Asia Pacific region, we view China as one of our largest market opportunities within the transportation segment. 
 
Electric Grid
 
Globally, electric utilities and power generation companies seek to maintain high levels of grid stability while seeking cost effective ways to accurately match electricity generation with demand. Essentially, there is no inventory of electricity; demand and generation must match. While the industry is capable of doing this from hour to hour, variations in load and demand from minute to minute cannot be accurately forecasted. When imbalances occur, the frequency (60 Hz in the U.S) can vary and must be balanced within very tight tolerances. Maintaining these tolerances is typically achieved through the use of auxiliary generators. If the load is either higher or lower than the power being generated, an auxiliary generator is either started or stopped. However, it takes these generators from generally five to fifteen minutes to ramp up to full efficient operation or to shut down. During that period, the load may change directions and the grid operator then must direct another auxiliary generator to shut down or ramp up. This is a very inefficient process with the grid operators constantly chasing a variable load. The process of managing these very short-term changes in energy demand is referred to as “frequency regulation.”
 
Utilities can address frequency regulation issues by maintaining on-line generating capacity at a level that is always higher than expected peak demand; however, this can be an expensive solution, particularly where natural gas, diesel and other alternative fuels are not affordable alternatives. Most U.S. utilities are required to maintain between 1% - 1.5% of their peak load capacity to provide frequency regulation. In many foreign countries where the electric grid is not as well developed as it is in the U.S., utilities need to reserve up to 5% or more of their capacity strictly to provide frequency regulation. 
 
To reduce the costs of providing frequency regulation, utilities and grid operators are seeking “fast response” energy storage systems, and battery-based systems can offer significant advantages over slower response sources of conventional generation. When supply exceeds demand for a short period, fast response storage systems deliver electric energy back to the grid for a short period to give operators time to reroute energy from another power generator or power-up a new power source. Our large-scale nLTO battery systems can react in milliseconds and meet this need. 
 
The need for a fast response energy storage technology, like our large-scale nLTO ESS, is increased by the accelerated use of renewable energy sources. Photo Voltaic (PV) solar and wind power generation by nature are intermittent and unpredictable sources of energy that can fluctuate widely in a very short period of time. For example, it is not uncommon for a PV array to fluctuate +/- 50% in less than 90 seconds. With a small rooftop array, it isn’t an issue, because the size of the generator is too small to matter. However, with a 50+ megawatt array, problems arise as the electric grid isn’t currently built to handle this kind of a fluctuation. According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, as of December 2016, twenty-nine states, the District of Columbia and three territories require the integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid through legislated renewable portfolio standards, while eight states and one territory have set renewable energy goals.
 
Many of these states have established targets requiring the integration of renewable generation sources equal to or exceeding 25% of total generation within the next decade. California is a good case in point. California has a mandate to generate 33% of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020. The mandated adoption of these renewable energy sources is likely to increase the need for effective, efficient, clean energy storage technologies to provide frequency regulation services and maintain the reliability and stability of the associated electric grid systems. For example, California Assembly Bill 2514 enacted in 2010, requires the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to establish energy storage procurement targets for California load serving entities in 2015 and 2020, if cost effective and commercially viable by October 2013. Implementation of AB 2514 is underway, and in February 2013, CPUC approved a long-term procurement decision and ordered Southern California Edison (SCE) to procure between 1,400 and 1,800 megawatts of energy resource capacity in the Los Angeles basin to meet long term local capacity requirements by 2021. Of this amount, CPUC required SCE to procure at least 50 megawatts from energy storage resources, as well as up to an additional 600 megawatts of capacity from preferred resources, which include energy efficiency, demand response and distributed generation, along with additional energy storage resources.

In our view, the key to addressing this market is to continually improve the performance of our energy storage systems, while reducing their cost (or the perception of their higher cost) to the end user. One key advantage that our nLTO batteries have is their projected higher cycle life, which can be four to six times higher than that of certain competing lithium battery technologies, such as lithium iron phosphate. Accordingly, we seek to market our products not on an initial cost of acquisition basis or even on a watt-hours per kilogram basis, but rather on the total cost of ownership over time. In addition, we seek to market the fast response capabilities of our battery, the value of which cannot be captured on a simple watt-hours per kilogram basis. The importance of fast response resources is beginning to gain considerable traction, as evidenced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) Order 755, whose “pay for performance” rules not only value the capacity of frequency regulation services, but also its speed and accuracy. We believe that these pay for performance rules will help mitigate the impact that low natural gas prices have had on the U.S. energy storage market for the electric grid. 
 
Industrial 
 
The industrial market segment encompasses a broad range of applications, ranging from the use of battery systems on cargo cranes to the use of battery systems with heavy industrial equipment. We believe that our high-power batteries can play an important role within this market segment. For example, our battery modules have been successfully integrated into the power system of Cargotec’s port handling machine. The company is a subsidiary of Kalmar who is the world leader of port handling solution provider. 
Key Features of Our nLTO Batteries 
 
One of the principal advantages of our nLTO battery is its rapid charge and discharge rate. The charge rate is the rate at which a battery’s energy is replenished, and the discharge rate is the rate at which the energy stored in a battery is transferred (or, in the case of self-discharge, leaked) out. Through the optimization of materials used in our nLTO battery cells, our current cells are capable of recharge times of 10 minutes to 95% or more of initial battery capacity. This rapid charge capability is important in our target markets. 
 
Our nLTO batteries have both a longer cycle life and calendar life than commercially available rechargeable battery technologies such as conventional lithium ion, nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries and nickel cadmium (NiCd) batteries. The ability of any rechargeable battery to store energy will diminish as a result of repeated charge/discharge cycles. A battery’s “cycle life” is the number of times it can be charged and discharged without a significant reduction in its energy storage capacity. Our nLTO is termed a zero-strain material, meaning that the material essentially does not change shape upon the entry and exit of a lithium ion in the material. Graphite, the most common material in conventional lithium ion batteries, will expand and contract as much as 8% with each charge/discharge cycle. This constant change in volume rapidly breaks down the battery resulting in significantly shorter calendar and cycle life than with our nLTO anodes. Our current generation of cells can achieve 16,000 cycles, which represents a significant improvement over conventional lithium batteries, which typically retain that level of charge capacity only through 2,500 to 4,000 deep charge/discharge cycles. Depending on the actual duty cycles and temperature, those figures can drop even lower.
 
Our nLTO also represents a breakthrough in low and high-temperature performance. Nearly 90% of room temperature charge retention is realized at -30°C from our nLTO battery cells. In contrast, common lithium ion technology possesses virtually no charging capabilities at this low temperature, and the other rechargeable battery types such as lead acid, NiMH and NiCd take 10 to 20 times longer to charge at this low temperature. 
 
We also believe that relative safety is one of the strengths of our nLTO batteries. Any battery cell or large battery unit with lithium ion cell technology must take into account safety considerations, the most important of which is thermal runaway.  Thermal runaway is the temperature at which the battery chemistry will break down causing the battery to overheat and potentially explode or catch fire. This temperature is often referred to as the critical temperature.  Critical temperature for lithium ion battery cells using conventional graphite anodes is around 130° C, a direct result of chemical reaction between the graphite and the electrolyte.  With our current nLTO anode in place of graphite and an appropriate cathode material, that critical temperature will be close to 200° C, an increase in safety margin of approximately 70° C.  Materials we are using in our lab operate at 250° C before the critical temperature is reached. The batteries we and our partners are developing for high power applications often consist of dozens or even thousands of battery cells working together as part of a single modular battery unit. When a large number of cells are aggregated into a single battery unit, the likelihood of, and risks associated with, thermal runaway increases.  In this context, we believe that the additional temperature margin our individual battery cells experience before reaching the critical temperature makes our battery cells better suited than competing lithium ion batteries for the high-power applications we are targeting.

The current generation of batteries made with our nLTO exhibit lower energy density at room temperatures than conventional lithium ion systems, although we are developing newer generations of nLTO batteries, which will increase our energy density. Energy density is normally described as watt-hours per kilogram or watt-hours per liter and refers to the available energy per unit weight or per unit volume. A battery with high energy density will deliver more energy per unit weight or volume than a battery with lower energy density. Our batteries made with our nLTO have energy densities, watt-hours per kilogram, that are better than lead acid, NiCd and NiMH batteries and approximately 50-70% of conventional lithium ion batteries when operated at room temperature. However, this energy density disadvantage is significantly less compared to conventional lithium ion batteries as the operating temperature moves away from room temperature, particularly to colder environments, and less significant in environments such as large vehicles and utilities in which battery volume is not a significant issue. When the end use of the battery requires constant performance across a wide range of temperatures, such as the need for a hybrid bus to function comparably in both winter and summer, our nLTO cells may be the preferred solution. Also, conventional lithium ion batteries prefer to cycle between approximately 30% and 80% state of charge to achieve optimum cycle life. As a result, they only use about 50% of their nominal available energy. Our nLTO batteries, on the other hand, are not so limited and as a result can use approximately 90% of their nominal available energy. Given this, we believe that comparisons of battery technologies on a watt-hours per kilogram basis can be misleading, as nLTO batteries offer a greater range of actual usable energy, along with four-to-six times the cycle life across a wider range of operating conditions.
 
Sources of Supply and Raw Materials
 
An important consideration, as we begin to grow our revenue stream, is to ensure that we have access to the various components and raw materials we need to manufacture and assemble our various products. As we anticipate larger orders, establishing multiple sources for key components is becoming much more important to us. Moreover, a key focus of our business plan is to aggregate our supply chain not only to reduce cost, but also to accelerate our ability to deliver products on a timely basis to our customers.
 
The basic building block for our battery cell’s anode is nLTO powder. We use compounds of lithium and of titanium to manufacture our nLTO. We currently source our lithium compound from the largest producers in China and do not foresee any problems in scaling up our purchases as our volume of business increases. Meanwhile we are developing and qualifying more suppliers in U.S., Australia and China. From end of 2015, Lithium material price has been rising rapidly, and our company has to be ready for solutions. We currently source our titanium compound from a supplier who is a global leader in the field and a Chinese domestic supplier, and we are in the process of identifying and qualifying additional sources for this key material. The supply of our cathode material of our cells supply is from a single supplier; therefore, we are planning to test materials from another Japanese supplier. At this point we are not anticipating any problems or disruptions to our supply of these raw material compounds.
 
As of the date hereof, we have only one source for the contract manufacturing of our nLTO battery cells, which are the building blocks of our battery modules and energy storage systems. This supplier has passed our rigorous technical requirements to be as our qualified supplier. We plan over the long run to qualify more OEM suppliers to reduce our dependency on one single supplier and meanwhile create competition between suppliers and eventually reduce cost. 
 
Having multiple qualified suppliers for components and materials used in the manufacture and assembly of our primary products is part of the business plan and has been realized for many of the components and materials. Supplier qualification for additional sources of components and materials will continue in 2017. 
 
Competition
 
Electric Grid: A number of advanced energy storage and power electronic component producers have entered into the frequency regulation market. They include Wanxiang, BYD, GS Yuasa, LG Chem, Mitsubishi, Saft, Microvast, Toshiba, Enerdel and XtremePower. As we or others continue to demonstrate traction in this market we expect to see increasing levels of competition from other suppliers and systems integrators, especially as the market rules in the U.S. and other markets move towards the acceptance of battery-based energy storage for frequency regulation. Favorable signs emerged in 2012, such as California Independent System Operator’s (CAISO) decision to adopt market changes which would reward frequency regulation resources for fast performance. CAISO now joins PJM Interconnection as the first to propose new rules which seek to comply with FERC’s Order 755, which requires pay for performance, especially for fast response resources that provide frequency regulation services. We believe that these changes are favorable for battery-based energy storage systems in general and for our nLTO battery technologies specifically, due to our unique fast response capabilities.

Our products typically compete with existing methods for providing frequency regulation and renewable integration rather than competing battery manufacturers. Today, most utilities and regional transmission organizations use existing coal, gas and diesel generating sources to provide frequency regulation. While these sources are inefficient and can be highly polluting (coal and diesel), they are known quantities and accepted by the various regulators and utilities. In many instances, particularly in the U.S., we are attempting to displace this accepted way of doing things. Consequently, the typical sales cycle for selling an energy storage system for frequency regulation can be quite lengthy. 
 
Another challenge is the cost of natural gas in the U.S. Much of the existing frequency regulation in the U.S. is provided by natural gas powered generators, and the price of natural gas pricing has been at historic lows. As a result, there is less of a financial incentive for utilities to implement our solution. This cost environment, however, is not expected to be sustainable. Natural gas prices are volatile and may rise over time, and batteries, like all technologies, will eventually see their prices drop as efficiencies are gained and as production volumes increase. As a result, we see greater opportunities for our frequency regulation products emerging over time in the U.S., especially with the introduction of new market mechanisms that place greater emphasis on fast response services. Moreover, we expect to see growing demand outside of the U.S., where fuel costs are significantly higher. If this new energy storage capability starts to get market traction, we expect the rate of acceptance to accelerate. Until then, however, we are experiencing a long sales cycle and don’t expect that to materially change in the near future. We believe that once we demonstrate revenue traction and demonstrate that the market does exist and is very large, other larger suppliers may also target this market.
 
In the Transportation (Commercial Vehicles), automotive passenger car markets, there are a large number of battery manufacturers and systems integrators currently serving the market. Many of them are larger companies with substantially stronger financial resources than we have. We believe the passenger car market will be driven by low margins and volume. As a result, we believe that only larger, well-capitalized companies will ultimately be successful in this market. We believe that commercial vehicles, including buses, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, on the other hand, present a different set of dynamics. The characteristics of our batteries are an excellent fit to satisfy the requirements of this market, and the needs here are different than in the general passenger car automotive market. We believe that we can be a successful competitor in this segment of the overall transportation market.
 
With respect to the electric and hybrid electric commercial vehicle markets, we are not aware of any commercially available products that have similar performance attributes as our nLTO batteries, although we suspect that similar batteries exist. Nonetheless, competitors have announced advanced lithium ion batteries and battery products aimed at these markets. Some may have greater energy density than our nLTO batteries. 
 
Currently, NiMH batteries dominate the hybrid electric vehicle market, although major hybrid manufacturers are beginning to switch to lithium ion batteries. NiMH batteries improve upon the energy capacity and power capabilities of older alternatives, such as NiCd (for the same size cell) by 30% to 40%. Since they contain fewer toxins than NiCd batteries, NiMH batteries are more environmentally friendly than NiCd batteries, although they are not as environmentally friendly as our nLTO battery. Like NiCd batteries, NiMH batteries can be charged in about 3 hours. Charging rates must be reduced by a factor of 5 to 10 at temperatures below 0°C (32°F) and above 40°C (104°F). NiMH batteries suffer from poor deep cycle ability (i.e. the ability to be discharged to 10% or less of their capacity), possessing a recharge capability following deep discharge on the order of 200 to 300 cycles. While NiMH batteries are capable of high power discharge, dedicated usage in high power applications limits cycle life even further. NiMH batteries also possess high self-discharge rates, which is unintentional leaking of a battery’s charge. NiMH batteries are intolerant to elevated temperature and, as a result, performance and capacity degrade sharply above room temperature. The most serious issue with NiMH, though, involves safety accompanying recharge. The temperature and internal pressure of a NiMH battery cell rises sharply as the cell nears 100% state of charge, necessitating the inclusion of complex cell monitoring electronics and sophisticated charging algorithms in order to prevent thermal runaway, and ultimately fire. A potential limiting factor for the widespread use of NiMH batteries may be the supply of nickel, potentially rendering the technology economically infeasible for these applications as demand continues to rise.
 
Producers of electric and hybrid electric vehicles are seeking to replace NiMH batteries with lithium ion batteries for several reasons. The demand for these vehicles is placing pressures on the limited supply of nickel, potentially rendering the technology economically infeasible for these applications as the demand continues to rise. Compared to NiMH batteries, lithium ion batteries are stable, charge more rapidly (in hours), exhibit low self-discharge, and require very little maintenance. Except as explained below, the safety, cycle life, calendar life, environmental impact and power of lithium ion batteries is comparable to those of NiMH and NiCd batteries.

Lithium ion batteries are the batteries of choice in small electronics, such as cell phones and portable computers, where high energy density and light weight are important. These same attributes are desired for electric vehicle, hybrid electric vehicle, fast energy storage and other markets. However, these applications are principally high power demand applications and/or pose other demands on usage, such as extremes of temperature, need for extremely short recharge times, and even longer extended lifetimes. Because of safety concerns related principally to the presence of graphite in conventional lithium ion batteries, conventional graphite-based lithium ion batteries sufficiently large for such power uses may raise safety concerns. In addition, current lithium ion technology is only capable of about 2,500 to 4,000 cycles. Conventional lithium ion batteries also do not function well at extremely hot or cold temperatures. Our batteries - which are safer, have a longer cycle life, rapid charge and discharge rates and function well at extreme temperatures - are designed to address the power market by providing many of the key benefits of lithium ion batteries without the shortcomings relative to the power market. As noted above, our competitors are developing high power, and temperature resilient non-conventional lithium ion batteries. We do not know the exact attributes of the evolving batteries.

Compliance with federal, state, or local laws or regulations represents a small part of our present budget. If we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations, however, a government entity may levy a fine on us or require us to take costly measures to ensure compliance. Any such fine or expenditure may adversely affect our development. 
 
Environmental Regulation and Liability 

As we conduct all of our manufacturing activities in China, we are subject to the requirements of PRC environmental laws and regulations on air emission, waste water discharge, solid waste and noise. The major environmental regulations applicable to us include the PRC Environmental Protection Law, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution and its Implementation Rules, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution and its Implementation Rules, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Solid Waste Pollution, and the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Noise Pollution. We aim to comply with environmental laws and regulations and have been pushing ahead with the authentication of ISO 14001 for environmental practices. We have already passed the first step of the ISO 14001 appraisal and the second step of the appraisal is in process. Passing the second step of the appraisal will give us ISO 14001 certification.  We have built environmental treatment facilities concurrently with construction of our manufacturing facilities, where waste air, waste water and waste solids we generate can be treated in accordance with the relevant requirements. We also outsource disposal of solid waste we generate to a third-party contractor. Certain key materials used in manufacturing, such as cobalt dioxide, electrolyte and separators, have proven innocuous to worker’s health and safety as well as the environment. We are not subject to any admonitions, penalties, investigations or inquiries imposed by the environmental regulators, nor are we subject to any claims or legal proceedings to which we are named as defendant for violation of any environmental law or regulation. We do not have any reasonable basis to believe that there is any threatened claim, action or legal proceedings against us that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
