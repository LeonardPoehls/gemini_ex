ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the "Company," "we," "us," "our" and similar expressions are references to Aaron’s, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
General Development of Business
Established in 1955 and incorporated in 1962 as a Georgia corporation, Aaron’s, Inc., is a leading omnichannel provider of lease-purchase solutions. Aaron’s engages in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories through its more than 1,860 Company-operated and franchised stores in 47 states and Canada as well as its e-commerce platform, Aarons.com. Our stores carry well-known brands such as Samsung®, Frigidaire®, Hewlett-Packard®, LG®, Whirlpool®, Simmons®, Philips®, Ashley® and Magnavox®. 
On April 14, 2014, the Company acquired a 100% ownership interest in Progressive Finance Holdings, LLC ("Progressive"), a leading virtual lease-to-own company, providing lease-purchase solutions through approximately 22,000 retail locations in 46 states.
On October 15, 2015, Progressive acquired a 100% ownership interest in Dent-A-Med, Inc., d/b/a the HELPcard® (collectively, "DAMI"), which provides a variety of "second-look" credit products that are originated through federally insured banks. Together with Progressive, DAMI allows the Company to provide retail and merchant partners one source for financing and leasing transactions with below-prime customers. The acquisition of DAMI is expected to drive long-term incremental revenue and earnings growth at Progressive, and DAMI will benefit from Progressive's proprietary technology, infrastructure and financial capacity. 
On May 13, 2016, the Company sold its 82 Company-operated HomeSmart stores (our weekly pay concept) and ceased operations of that segment.
As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,864 Aaron's stores, comprised of 1,165 Company-operated stores in 28 states, the District of Columbia and Canada, and 699 independently-owned franchised stores in 46 states and Canada. 
We own or have rights to various trademarks and trade names used in our business including Aaron’s, Aaron’s Sales & Lease Ownership, Progressive, Dent-A-Med, the HELPcard® and Woodhaven Furniture Industries. We intend to file for additional trade name and trademark protection when appropriate.
Business Environment and Company Outlook
Like many industries, the lease-to-own industry has been transformed by the internet and virtual marketplace. We believe the Progressive and DAMI acquisitions have been strategically transformational for the Company in this respect and will continue to strengthen our business as demonstrated by Progressive’s significant revenue and profit growth in 2016. We also believe the traditional lease-to-own industry has been negatively impacted in recent periods by: (i) the continuing economic challenges facing many traditional lease-to-own customers; (ii) increased competition from a wide range of competitors, including national, regional and local operators of lease-to-own stores; virtual lease-to-own companies; traditional and e-commerce retailers; and, indirectly, from various types of consumer finance companies that enable our customers to shop at traditional or online retailers; and (iii) the challenges faced by many traditional “brick-and-mortar” retailers, with respect to a decrease in the number of consumers visiting those stores, especially younger consumers. In response to these changing market conditions, we are executing a strategic plan that focuses on the following items and that we believe positions us for success over the long-term:

• | Improve Aaron's store profitability – We remain committed to increasing profits through improved marketing and customer acquisition strategies, improved collections and merchandise loss controls, optimization of product mix, increases in customer retention, inventory reduction, cost efficiency initiatives and closing underperforming Aaron's stores. In addition, our Aaron’s Business is investing in improving its analytical capabilities to optimize pricing, promotion, and product mix, which is expected to enhance margins and drive lease volume.


• | Accelerate our omnichannel platform – We believe Aarons.com represents an opportunity to provide more options and shopping convenience in the lease-to-own industry. We are focused on engaging customers in ways that are convenient for them by providing them a seamless, direct-to-door platform through which to shop across our product offering.


• | Strengthen relationships of Progressive and DAMI's current retail partners – Our Progressive and DAMI businesses have benefited from long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with our existing retailer base. Our ability to maintain these relationships and address the changing needs of these retailers is critical to the long-term growth strategy of our business.

4


• | Focus on converting existing pipeline into Progressive retail partners – Our Progressive business segment is continuously focused on establishing new relationships with retailers and identifying solutions that address their business needs. We believe these new relationships are fundamental to continued revenue growth for Progressive.


• | Champion compliance – Aaron’s, Inc. is a large and diverse company with thousands of daily transactions that are extensively regulated and subject to the requirements of various federal, state, and local laws and regulations. We continue to believe and set expectations that long-term success requires all associates to behave in an ethical manner and to comply with all laws and regulations governing our company’s behavior.

Operating Segments
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had five operating segments: Sales and Lease Ownership, Progressive, DAMI, Franchise and Manufacturing. 
The results of DAMI and Progressive have been included in the Company’s consolidated results and presented as operating segments from their October 15, 2015 and April 14, 2014 acquisition dates, respectively. On May 13, 2016, the Company sold its HomeSmart operating segment, which included 82 stores.
Our Company-operated Aaron's stores and franchise operations are located in the United States and Canada. The operating results of our five reportable segments may be found in (i) Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and (ii) Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
Sales and Lease Ownership
Our Sales and Lease Ownership operation was established in 1987 and employs a monthly and semi-monthly payment model to provide durable household goods to lower to middle income consumers through our Aaron's stores. Its customer base is comprised primarily of customers with limited access to traditional credit sources such as bank financing, installment credit or credit cards. Customers of our Sales and Lease Ownership segment take advantage of our services to acquire consumer goods they might not otherwise be able to without incurring additional debt or long-term obligations.
We have developed a distinctive concept for our stores including specific merchandising, store layout, pricing and agreement terms all designed to appeal to our target consumer market. We believe these features create a store and a sales and lease ownership concept that is distinct from the operations of the lease-to-own industry generally and from consumer electronics and home furnishings retailers who finance merchandise.
The typical store layout is a combination showroom and warehouse generally comprising 6,000 to 10,000 square feet, with an average of approximately 8,000 square feet. In addition to inline space, we also lease and own free standing buildings in certain markets. We typically locate the stores close to retailers who have similar customer demographics.
Each store usually maintains at least two trucks for delivery, service and return of product. We generally offer same or next day delivery for addresses located within approximately ten miles of the store. Our stores provide a broad selection of brand name electronics, computers, appliances, bedding and furniture, including bedding and furniture manufactured by our Woodhaven Furniture Industries division.
Approximately 97% of our store lease agreements have monthly payment terms and the remaining 3% are semi-monthly. By comparison, weekly agreements are the industry standard. 
We may re-lease or sell merchandise that customers return to us prior to the expiration of their agreements. We may also offer up-front purchase options at prices we believe are competitive. 
Franchise
We franchise our Aaron's stores in markets where we have no immediate plans to enter. Our franchise program adds value to our Company by allowing us to (i) recognize additional revenues from franchise fees and royalties, (ii) strategically grow without incurring direct capital or other expenses, (iii) lower our average costs of purchasing, manufacturing and advertising through economies of scale and (iv) increase customer recognition of our brands.
Franchisees are approved on the basis of the applicant’s business background and financial resources. We enter into agreements with our franchisees to govern the opening and operations of franchised stores. Under our standard agreement, we receive a franchise fee from $15,000 to $50,000 per store depending upon market size. Our standard agreement is for a term of ten years, with one ten-year renewal option. Franchisees are also obligated to remit to us royalty payments of 5% or 6% of the weekly cash revenue collections from their stores. Most franchisees are involved in the day-to-day operations of their stores.
Because of the importance of location to our store strategy, we assist each franchisee in selecting the proper site for each store. We typically will visit the intended market and provide guidance to the franchisee through the site selection process. Once the franchisee selects a site, we provide support in designing the floor plan, including the proper layout of the showroom and warehouse. In addition, we assist the franchisee in the design and decor of the showroom to ensure consistency with our 
5

requirements. We also lease the exterior signage to the franchisee and provide support with respect to pre-opening advertising, initial inventory and delivery vehicles.
Qualifying franchisees may take part in a financing arrangement we have established with several financial institutions to assist the franchisee in establishing and operating their store(s). Although an inventory financing plan is the primary component of the financing program, we have also arranged, in certain circumstances, for the franchisee to receive a revolving credit line, allowing them to expand operations. We provide guarantees for amounts outstanding under this franchise financing program.
All franchisees are required to complete a comprehensive training program and to operate their franchised sales and lease ownership stores in compliance with our policies, standards and specifications. Additionally, each franchise is required to represent and warrant its compliance with all applicable federal, state and/or local laws, regulations and ordinances with respect to its business operations. Although franchisees are not generally required to purchase their lease merchandise from our fulfillment centers, many do so in order to take advantage of Company-sponsored financing, bulk purchasing discounts and favorable delivery terms.
Our internal audit department conducts annual financial reviews of each franchisee, as well as annual operational audits of each franchised store. In addition, our proprietary management information system links each Company and franchised store to our corporate headquarters.
Manufacturing
Woodhaven Furniture Industries, our manufacturing segment, was established by the Company in 1982, and we believe it makes us the largest lease-to-own company in the United States that manufactures its own furniture. Integrated manufacturing enables us to control critical features such as the quality, cost, delivery, styling, durability and quantity of our furniture products, and we believe this provides an integration advantage over our competitors. Substantially all produced items continue to be leased or sold through Aaron's stores, including franchised stores. 
Our Woodhaven Furniture Industries division produces upholstered living-room furniture (including contemporary sofas, chairs and modular sofa and ottoman collections in a variety of natural and synthetic fabrics) and bedding (including standard sizes of mattresses and box springs). The furniture designed and produced by this division incorporates features that we believe result in reduced production costs, enhanced durability and improved shipping processes all relative to furniture we would otherwise purchase from third parties. These features include (i) standardized components, (ii) reduced number of parts and features susceptible to wear or damage, (iii) more resilient foam, (iv) durable fabrics and sturdy frames which translate to longer life and higher residual value and (v) devices that allow sofas to stand on end for easier and more efficient transport. The segment also provides replacement covers for all styles and fabrics of its upholstered furniture, as well as other parts, for use in reconditioning leased furniture that has been returned.
The segment consists of five furniture manufacturing plants and nine bedding manufacturing facilities totaling approximately 838,000 square feet of manufacturing capacity.
Progressive
Established in 1999 and acquired by the Company in 2014, Progressive is a leader in the expanding virtual lease-to-own market. Progressive partners with retailers, primarily in the furniture and bedding, mobile phones, consumer electronics, appliances and jewelry industries, to offer a lease-purchase option for customers to acquire goods they might not otherwise have been able to obtain. We serve customers who are credit challenged and are therefore unlikely to have access to traditional credit-based financing options. We offer a technology-based application and approval process that does not require Progressive employees to be staffed in a store. Once a customer is approved, Progressive purchases the merchandise from the retailer and enters into a lease-to-own agreement with the customer. The contract provides early-buyout options or ownership after a contractual number of payments. Progressive has retail partners in 46 states and operates under state-specific regulations in those states.
DAMI
Founded in 1983 and acquired by the Company in 2015, DAMI primarily serves customers that may not qualify for traditional prime lending who desire to purchase goods and services from participating merchants. DAMI, which operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Progressive, offers customized programs, with services that include revolving loans, private label cards and access to a unique processing platform. DAMI’s current network of merchants includes medical markets, beds and fitness equipment. The Company believes the DAMI product offerings are complementary to those of Progressive and is expanding into the markets and merchants that DAMI serves. 
We extend or decline credit to an applicant through third party bank partners based upon the customer's credit rating. Our bank partners originate the loan by providing financing to the merchant at the point of sale and acquiring the receivable at a discount from the face value, which represents a pre-negotiated fee between DAMI and the merchant. DAMI then acquires the receivable from the bank. 
6

Qualifying customers receive a credit card to finance their initial purchase and to use in subsequent purchases at the merchant or other participating merchants for an initial two year period, which we will renew if the cardholder remains in good standing. The customer is required to make periodic minimum payments and pay certain annual and other periodic fees. 
Operations
Operating Strategy
Our operating strategy is based on distinguishing our brand from those of our competitors along with maximizing our operational efficiencies. We implement this strategy for our Aaron's store-based operations by (i) emphasizing the uniqueness of our sales and lease ownership concept from those in our industry generally; (ii) offering high levels of customer service; (iii) promoting our vendors' and Aaron’s brand names; (iv) managing merchandise through our manufacturing and distribution capabilities; and (v) utilizing proprietary management information systems. 
We believe that the success of our store-based operations is attributable to our distinctive approach to the business that distinguishes us from both our lease-to-own and credit retail competitors. We have pioneered innovative approaches to meeting changing customer needs that we believe differ from many of our competitors. These include (i) offering lease ownership agreements that result in a lower "all-in" price; (ii) maintaining larger and more attractive store showrooms; (iii) offering a wider selection of higher-quality merchandise; (iv) providing an up-front cash and carry purchase option on select merchandise at competitive prices; and (v) establishing an online platform that provides access to our product offering. 
Our Progressive and DAMI operating strategies are based on providing excellent service to our merchant partners and our customers, along with continued development of technology-based solutions. This allows us to increase our merchant partners' sales, drive demand for our service, and scale in an efficient manner. Specifically with Progressive, we believe our ability to service a retailer with limited labor costs allows us to maintain a cost of ownership for leased merchandise lower than that of other options available to our customers.
Aaron's Store-Based Operations
As of December 31, 2016, the Company has one President, one Chief Operations Officer and one senior vice president that provide executive leadership of the Sales and Lease Ownership segment. The segment has 11 divisional vice presidents and one Canadian director who are responsible for the overall performance of their respective divisions. Each division is subdivided into geographic groupings of stores overseen by a total of 22 Sales and Lease Ownership senior regional managers and 130 regional managers, including three Canadian regional managers.
At the individual store level, the store manager is primarily responsible for managing and supervising all aspects of store operations, including (i) customer relations and account management, (ii) deliveries and pickups, (iii) warehouse and inventory management, (iv) partial merchandise selection, (v) employment decisions, including hiring, training and terminating store employees and (vi) certain marketing initiatives. Store managers also administer the processing of lease return merchandise including making determinations with respect to inspection, repairs, sales, reconditioning and subsequent leasing. 
Our business philosophy emphasizes safeguarding of Company assets, strict cost containment and financial controls. All personnel are expected to monitor expenses to contain costs. We pay all material invoices from Company headquarters in order to enhance financial accountability. We believe that careful monitoring of lease merchandise as well as operational expenses enables us to maintain financial stability and profitability.
We use management information systems to facilitate customer orders, collections, merchandise returns and inventory monitoring. Through the use of proprietary software, each of our stores is network linked directly to corporate headquarters enabling us to monitor single store performance on a daily basis. This network system assists the store manager in (i) tracking merchandise on the showroom floor and warehouse, (ii) minimizing delivery times, (iii) assisting with product purchasing and (iv) matching customer needs with available inventory.
Lease Agreement Approval, Renewal and Collection 
One of the factors in the success of our store-based operations is timely cash collections, which are monitored by store managers. Customers are contacted within a few days after their lease payment due dates to encourage them to keep their agreement current. Careful attention to cash collections is particularly important in sales and lease ownership operations, where the customer typically has the option to cancel the agreement at any time and each contractually due payment is generally considered a renewal of the agreement.
We generally perform no formal credit check with third party service providers with respect to our store customers. We do, however, verify employment or other reliable sources of income and personal references supplied by the customer. Generally our agreements for merchandise require payments in advance and the merchandise normally is recovered if a payment is significantly in arrears. We currently do not extend credit to our customers at our stores.
7

Our Progressive business uses a proprietary decisioning algorithm to determine which customers would meet our leasing qualifications. The transaction is completed through our online portal or through a point of sale integration with our retail partners. Contractual payments are based on a customer’s pay frequency and are typically originated through automated clearing house payments. If the payment is unsuccessful, collections are managed in-house through our call center, customer service hubs and proprietary lease management system. The call center contacts customers within a few days after the due date to encourage them to keep their agreement current. If the customer chooses to return the merchandise, arrangements are made to receive the merchandise from the customer, either through our retail partners, our Draper, Utah location, our customer service hubs or our Aaron's operated stores.
The provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of consolidated lease revenues were 4.8%, 5.1% and 4.5% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We believe that our collection and recovery policies materially comply with applicable law and we discipline any employee we determine to have deviated from such policies.
Credit Agreement Approval and Collection
DAMI partners with merchants to provide a variety of revolving credit products originated through two third-party federally insured banks to customers that may not qualify for traditional prime lending (called "second-look" financing programs).We believe DAMI provides the following strategic benefits when combined with Progressive's product offerings:

• | Enhanced product for retail partners - DAMI enhances Progressive's best-in-class point-of-sale product with an integrated solution for below-prime customers. DAMI has a centralized, scalable decisioning model with a long operating history, deployed through its established bank partners, and a sophisticated receivable management system.


• | Higher consumer credit quality - DAMI primarily serves customers with FICO scores between 600 and 700, which make up approximately a quarter of the U.S. population. These customers generally have greater purchasing power with stronger credit profiles than Progressive's current customers.


• | Expanded customer base - In addition to complementing Progressive's traditional offering for existing and prospective retail partners, DAMI's strong relationships with merchant partners that provide customer services offer an additional channel for longer-term growth.

DAMI uses an underwriting model that provides standardized credit decisions, including borrowing limit amounts. Credit decisions are primarily based on the customer’s credit rating and ability-to-pay ratio. Customer credit terms are based on the underlying agreement between DAMI and the merchant. Loans receivable are unsecured, and collections on loans receivable are managed in-house through DAMI's call center and proprietary loans receivable management system. 
Customer Service
A critical component of the success in our operations is our commitment to developing good relationships with our customers. Building a relationship with the customer that ensures customer satisfaction is critical because customers of store-based operations and Progressive have the option of returning the leased merchandise at any time. Our goal, therefore, is to develop positive associations about the Company and our products, service, and support in the minds of our customers from the moment they enter our showrooms and the showrooms of our retail partners. We demonstrate our commitment to superior customer service by providing customers with access to product through multiple channels, including Aarons.com and Progressive's network of retail partner locations, rapid delivery of leased merchandise (often on same or next day delivery) and investments in technology that improve the customer experience. Our Progressive business offers centralized customer and retailer support through contact centers located in Draper, Utah and Glendale, Arizona.
Aaron’s customers receive multiple complimentary service benefits. These benefits vary according to applicable state law but generally include a same-as-cash option, merchandise repair service, lifetime reinstatement and other discounts and benefits. In order to increase leasing at existing stores, we foster relationships with existing customers to attract recurring business, and many new agreements are attributable to repeat customers. Similarly, we believe our strong focus on customer satisfaction at Progressive and DAMI generates repeat business and long-lasting relationships with our retail and merchant partners.
Our emphasis on customer service requires that we develop skilled, effective employees who value our customers and project a genuine desire to serve their needs. To meet this requirement, we have created and implemented a very comprehensive associate development program. The associate development program focuses on and meets the needs of both new and tenured associates. 
8

Our associate development program is designed to provide a uniform and unbeatable customer service experience. The primary focus of the associate development program is to equip all associates, regardless of tenure or current skill level with the knowledge and skills needed to build strong relationships with our customers. Our learning and development coaches provide live, interactive instruction via webinars and conduct daily training that streams via in-store video to each new hire and tenured associate. The program is complemented with a robust, dynamic e-learning library. Additionally, Aaron’s has a management development program that offers development for current and future store managers and a highly successful leadership development program for our multi-unit managers. Also, we produce and post weekly video-based communications regarding important Company initiatives on our intranet site.
During 2015, the Company announced the launch of Approve.Me, which is a proprietary platform that integrates with third party retailers' point-of-sale systems and provides a single interface for all Progressive and DAMI customers seeking credit approval or lease options, from prime to second-look financing, or to Progressive's lease offering. The platform combines multiple credit and leasing providers into one application using a single interface. Approve.Me is compatible with most primary or secondary providers and is designed to give retailers a faster and more efficient way to service customers seeking to finance transactions or secure a lease option.
Purchasing and Retail Relationships
For our Aaron's store-based operations, our merchandise product mix is determined by executive leadership in consultation with regional managers, divisional vice presidents and our merchandising department based on an analysis of customer demands. The following table shows the percentage of our Aaron's business revenues attributable to different merchandise categories: 

 | Year Ended December 31,
Merchandise Category | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Furniture | 42 | % | | 42 | % | 39 | %
Electronics | 26 | % | | 25 | % | 26 | %
Appliances | 24 | % | | 24 | % | 24 | %
Computers | 6 | % | | 7 | % | 9 | %
Other | 2 | % | | 2 | % | 2 | %

One of our largest suppliers is our own Woodhaven Furniture Industries segment, which supplies the majority of the upholstered furniture and bedding we lease or sell. Integrated manufacturing enables us to control the quality, cost, delivery, styling, durability and quantity of a substantial portion of our furniture and bedding merchandise and provides us with a reliable source of products. We purchase the remaining merchandise directly from manufacturers and local distributors and are generally able to obtain bulk discounts that provide us with cost advantages. To a lesser extent, we also may sell or re-lease certain merchandise returned by our Progressive customers. We have no long-term agreements for the purchase of merchandise.
The following table shows the percentage of Progressive’s revenues attributable to different retail partner categories:

 | Year Ended December 31,
Retail Partner Category | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Furniture | 57 | % | | 53 | % | 44 | %
Mattress | 19 | % | | 20 | % | 24 | %
Automobile electronics and accessories | 12 | % | | 12 | % | 13 | %
Mobile | 5 | % | | 8 | % | 12 | %
Jewelry | 4 | % | | 4 | % | 4 | %
Other | 3 | % | | 3 | % | 3 | %

During 2016, two retail partners each provided greater than 10% of the lease merchandise acquired by Progressive and subsequently leased to customers.

The following table shows the percentage of DAMI’s revenues attributable to different merchant partner categories:
 | Year Ended December 31,
Merchant Partner Category | 2016 | | 2015
Medical | 48 | % | | 53 | %
Retail | 20 | % | | 22 | %
Furniture | 22 | % | | 14 | %
Other | 10 | % | | 11 | %

Distribution for Aaron's Store-based Operations
The Aaron's store-based operations utilize our 16 fulfillment centers to control merchandise. These centers average approximately 124,000 square feet, giving us approximately 2.0 million square feet of logistical capacity. 
We believe that our network of fulfillment centers provides us with a strategic advantage over our competitors. Our distribution system allows us to deliver merchandise promptly to our stores in order to quickly meet customer demand and effectively manage inventory levels. Most of our continental U.S. stores are within a 250-mile radius of a fulfillment center, facilitating timely shipment of products to the stores and fast delivery of orders to customers. 
We realize freight savings from bulk discounts and more efficient distribution of merchandise by using fulfillment centers. We use our own tractor-trailers, local delivery trucks and various contract carriers to make weekly deliveries to individual stores.
Marketing and Advertising
Our marketing for store-based operations targets both current Aaron’s customers and potential customers. We feature brand name products available through our no-credit-needed lease ownership plans. We reach our customer demographics by utilizing national and local television and radio with a combination of brand/image messaging and product/price promotions. In addition, we have enhanced our broadcast presence with digital marketing and via social environments such as Facebook and Twitter.
We target new and current customers each month distributing over 27 million, four-page circulars to homes in the United States and Canada. The circulars advertise brand name merchandise along with the features, options, and benefits of Aaron’s no-credit-needed lease ownership plans. We also distribute millions of email and direct mail promotions on an annual basis.
Aaron’s, Inc. sponsors events at various levels along with select professional and collegiate sports, such as NFL, MLB, NASCAR and NBA teams. All of the Company's sports partnerships are supported with advertising, promotional, marketing and brand activation initiatives that we believe significantly enhance the Company’s brand awareness and customer loyalty.
Progressive and DAMI execute their marketing strategy in partnership with retailers and other merchants. This is typically accomplished through in-store signage and marketing material, direct marketing activities, and the education of sales associates.
Competition
The lease-to-own industry is highly competitive. Our largest competitor for store-based operations is Rent-A-Center, Inc. ("Rent-A-Center"). Aaron’s and Rent-A-Center, which are the two largest lease-to-own industry participants, account for approximately 4,700 of the 9,200 lease-to-own stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Our Aaron's stores compete with other national, regional and local operators of lease-to-own stores, virtual lease-to-own companies, traditional and e-commerce retailers (including many that offer layaway programs) and, indirectly, various types of consumer finance companies that may enable our customers to shop at traditional or on-line retailers, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. We also compete with retail stores for customers desiring to purchase merchandise for cash or on credit. Competition is based primarily on product selection and availability, customer service and lease rates, store location and terms.
Although an emerging market, the virtual lease-to-own industry is also competitive. Progressive's largest competitor is Acceptance Now, a division of Rent-A-Center. Other competition is fragmented and includes regional participants.
Working Capital
We are required to maintain significant levels of lease merchandise in order to provide the service demanded by our customers and to ensure timely delivery of our products. Consistent and dependable sources of liquidity are required to maintain such merchandise levels. Failure to maintain appropriate levels of merchandise could materially adversely affect our customer relationships and our business. We believe our cash on hand, operating cash flows, credit availability under our financing agreements and other sources of financing are adequate to meet our normal liquidity requirements. 
10

Raw Materials
The principal raw materials we use in furniture manufacturing are fabric, foam, fiber, wire-innerspring assemblies, plywood, oriented strand board and hardwood. All of these materials are purchased in the open market from unaffiliated sources. We are not dependent on any single supplier. None of the raw materials we use are in short supply.
Seasonality
Our revenue mix is moderately seasonal for both our Aaron's store-based operations and our Progressive business. The first quarter of each year generally has higher revenues than any other quarter. This is primarily due to realizing the full benefit of business that historically gradually increases in the fourth quarter as a result of the holiday season, as well as the receipt by our customers in the first quarter of federal and state income tax refunds. Our customers will more frequently exercise the early purchase option on their existing lease agreements or purchase merchandise off the showroom floor during the first quarter of the year. We expect these trends to continue in future periods. 
Industry Overview
The Lease-to-Own Industry
The lease-to-own industry offers customers an alternative to traditional methods of obtaining home furnishings, electronics, appliances and computers. In a standard industry lease-to-own transaction, the customer has the option to acquire ownership of merchandise over a fixed term, usually 12 to 24 months, normally by making weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly lease payments. Upon making regular periodic lease payments, the customer may cancel the agreement at any time by returning the merchandise to the store. If the customer leases the item through the completion of the full term, he or she then obtains ownership of the item. The customer may also purchase the item at any time by tendering the contractually specified payment.
The lease-to-own model is particularly attractive to customers who are unable to pay the full upfront purchase price for merchandise or who lack the credit to qualify for conventional financing programs. Other individuals who find the lease-to-own model attractive are customers who, despite access to credit, do not wish to incur additional debt, have only a temporary need for the merchandise or desire to field test a particular brand or model before purchasing it.
Aaron’s Sales and Lease Ownership versus Traditional Lease-to-Own
We blend elements of lease-to-own and traditional retailing by providing customers with the option to either lease merchandise with the opportunity to obtain ownership or to purchase merchandise outright. We believe our sales and lease ownership program is a more effective method of retailing our merchandise to lower and middle income customers than a typical lease-to-own business or the traditional method of credit installment sales. 
Our model is distinctive from the conventional lease-to-own model in that we encourage our customers to obtain ownership of their leased merchandise. Based upon our own data and industry data, our customers obtain ownership more often (approximately 45%) than in the lease-to-own businesses in general (approximately 25%). 
We believe our sales and lease ownership model offers the following distinguishing characteristics when compared to traditional lease-to-own stores:

• | Lower total cost - Our agreement terms generally provide a lower cost of ownership to the customer.


• | Wider merchandise selection - We generally offer a larger selection of higher-quality merchandise.


• | Larger store layout - Aaron's stores average 8,000 square feet, which is significantly larger than the average size of our largest competitor’s lease-to-own stores.


• | Fewer payments - Our typical plan offers semi-monthly or monthly payments versus the industry standard of weekly payments.


• | Flexible payment methods - We offer our customers the opportunity to pay by cash, check, ACH, debit card or credit card. Our Aaron’s stores currently receive approximately 68% of their payment volume (in dollars) from customers by check, debit card or credit card.

We believe our sales and lease ownership model also compares well against traditional retailers in areas such as merchandise selection and the latest product offerings. As technology advances and home furnishings and appliances evolve, we expect to continue offering our customers the latest product at affordable prices.
11

Unlike transactions with traditional retailers, in which the customer is committed to purchasing the merchandise, our sales and lease ownership transactions are not credit installment contracts. Therefore, the customer may elect to terminate the transaction after a short, initial lease period. Our stores offer an up-front "cash and carry" purchase option and generally a same-as-cash option on most merchandise at prices that we believe are competitive with traditional retailers. In addition, our Progressive business provides a 90-day buy-out option on lease-purchase solutions offered through traditional retailers.
Government Regulation
Our operations are extensively regulated by and subject to the requirements of various federal, state and local laws and regulations, and are subject to oversight by various government agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), for example, which may exercise oversight of the advertising and other business practices of our Company-operated and franchised stores. In general, such laws regulate applications for leases, pricing, late charges and other fees, the form of disclosure statements, the substance and sequence of required disclosures, the content of advertising materials and certain collection procedures. Violations of certain provisions of these laws may result in material penalties. We are unable to predict the nature or effect on our operations or earnings of unknown future legislation, regulations and judicial decisions or future interpretations of existing and future legislation or regulations relating to our operations, and there can be no assurance that future laws, decisions or interpretations will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or earnings.
A summary of certain of the laws under which we operate follows. This summary does not purport to be a complete summary of the laws referred to below or of all the laws regulating our operations.
Currently, nearly every state, the District of Columbia, and most provinces in Canada specifically regulate lease-to-own transactions via state or provincial statutes. This includes states in which we currently operate Sales and Lease Ownership stores, as well as states in which our Progressive business has retail partners. Most state lease purchase laws require lease-to-own companies to disclose to their customers the total number of payments, total amount and timing of all payments to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that may be imposed and miscellaneous other items. The more restrictive state lease purchase laws limit the total amount that a customer may be charged for an item, or regulate the "cost-of-rental" amount that lease-to-own companies may charge on lease-to-own transactions, generally defining "cost-of-rental" as lease fees paid in excess of the "retail" price of the goods. Our long-established policy in all states is to disclose the terms of our lease purchase transactions as a matter of good business ethics and customer service. We believe we are in material compliance with the various state lease purchase laws. At the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the lease-to-own transaction. Federal legislation to regulate the transaction has been proposed from time to time. In addition, certain elements of the business including matters such as collections activity, customer contact and credit reporting may be subject to federal laws and regulation. 
There has been increased legislative and regulatory attention in the United States, at both the federal and state levels, on financial services products offered to near-prime and subprime consumers in general, which may result in an increase in legislative regulatory efforts directed at the lease-to-own industry. We cannot predict whether any such legislation or regulations will be enacted and what the impact would be on us, nor can we predict whether any state attorneys general or federal regulatory agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") will direct any initiatives toward our industry. 
Our sales and lease ownership franchise program is subject to FTC oversight and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Several state laws also regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC requires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a Franchise Disclosure Document ("FDD") containing prescribed information. A number of states in which we might consider franchising also regulate the sale of franchises and require registration of the franchise disclosure document with state authorities. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable franchise laws in those states in which we do business and with similar laws in Canada.
DAMI is subject to various federal and state laws that address lending regulations, consumer information, consumer rights, and certain credit card specific requirements, among other things. In addition, DAMI issues credit cards through third party bank partners and therefore is subject to those banks' Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulators. Several regulations affecting DAMI have been updated in recent years through The Credit Card Act and The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act). Additional regulations are being developed, as the attention placed on consumer debt transactions has grown significantly. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. While we are unable to predict the results of any regulatory initiatives, we do not believe that existing and currently proposed regulations will have a material adverse impact on our operations. Although we are unable to predict the results of any regulatory initiatives, we do not believe that existing and currently proposed regulations will have a material adverse impact on our sales and lease ownership or other operations.

Supply Chain Diligence and Transparency
Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act was adopted to further the humanitarian goal of ending the violent conflict and human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries ("DRC"). This conflict has been partially financed by the exploitation and trade of tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold, often referred to as conflict minerals, which originate from mines or smelters in the region. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act require reporting companies to disclose annually, among other things, whether any such minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products they manufactured during the prior calendar year originated in the DRC and, if so, whether the related revenues were used to support the conflict and/or abuses. 
Some of the products manufactured by Woodhaven Furniture Industries, our manufacturing division, may contain tantalum, tin, tungsten and/or gold. Consequently, in compliance with SEC rules, we have adopted a policy on conflict minerals, which can be found on our website at investor.aarons.com. We have also implemented a supply chain due diligence and risk mitigation process with reference to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or the OECD, guidance approved by the SEC to assess and report annually whether our products are conflict free.
We expect our suppliers to comply with the OECD guidance and industry standards and to ensure that their supply chains conform to our policy and the OECD guidance. We plan to mitigate identified risks by working with our suppliers and may alter our sources of supply or modify our product design if circumstances require.
Employees
At December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately 11,500 employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our relations with employees are good.
