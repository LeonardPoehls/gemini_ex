ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
We are a leader in the ownership, management, redevelopment and development of office and business park properties in the greater Washington, D.C. region. Our focus is owning and operating properties that we believe can benefit from our market knowledge and intensive operational skills, with a focus on increasing their profitability and value. Our portfolio primarily contains a mix of single-tenant and multi-tenant office properties and business parks. Office properties are single-story and multi-story buildings that are primarily for office use, and business parks contain buildings with office features combined with some industrial property space. We separate our properties into four distinct reporting segments, which we refer to as the Washington, D.C., Maryland, Northern Virginia and Southern Virginia reporting segments.
We conduct our business through First Potomac Realty Investment Limited Partnership, our operating partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). We are the sole general partner of, and, as of December 31, 2016, owned 95.8% of the common interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining common interests in the Operating Partnership, which are presented as noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, are limited partnership interests that are owned by unrelated parties.
At December 31, 2016, we wholly owned properties totaling 6.7 million square feet and had a noncontrolling ownership interest in properties totaling an additional 0.9 million square feet through five unconsolidated joint ventures. We also owned land that can support 0.6 million square feet of additional development. Our consolidated properties were 92.6% occupied by 384 tenants at December 31, 2016. We do not include square footage of properties in development or redevelopment in our occupancy calculation. At December 31, 2016, none of the 6.7 million square feet owned through our properties was in development or redevelopment. We derive substantially all of our revenue from leases of space within our properties. As of December 31, 2016, our largest tenant was the U.S. Government, which accounted for 16% of our total annualized cash basis rent, and the U.S. Government combined with government contractors accounted for 27% of our total annualized cash basis rent as of December 31, 2016. We operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had consolidated total revenues of $160.3 million and consolidated total assets of $1.3 billion. Financial information related to our four reporting segments is set forth in note 17, Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements.
Our corporate headquarters are located at 7600 Wisconsin Avenue, 11th Floor, Bethesda, Maryland 20814, and we believe our current space is sufficient to meet our current needs. We do not own the building in which we lease space for our corporate headquarters. As of December 31, 2016, we had four other offices for our property management operations, which occupy approximately 18,000 square feet within buildings we own. 
Our History
The Operating Partnership was formed in 1997 to focus on the acquisition, development and redevelopment of industrial properties and business parks, primarily in the suburban markets of the greater Washington, D.C. region. The Company was formed as a Maryland trust in 2003, and we completed our initial public offering in October 2003. At December 31, 2003, we owned properties totaling 2.9 million square feet and had total assets of $244.1 million. By the beginning of 2010, we had grown our portfolio to over 12 million square feet and had total assets of $1.1 billion. In 2010, we entered the office market in Washington, D.C. with the acquisition of four office properties, including one property purchased through an unconsolidated joint venture, and thereafter continued our focus on acquiring office properties. We updated our strategic and capital plan in 2013, which, among other things, included a capital recycling strategy to divest of lower quality assets. During 2013, we sold the majority of our industrial portfolio and decided to strategically focus on office properties and business parks. In 2016, we completed an extensive underwriting of our business, our portfolio and our team, and based on this underwriting, we began implementing a new strategic plan, the focus of which is to de-risk the portfolio, de-lever the balance sheet and maximize asset values (the “Strategic Plan”). See “Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Strategic Plan” for a

detailed discussion of the Strategic Plan’s key action items and the measures we have taken to complete these strategic objectives during 2016. 
Description of Business
We have used our management team’s knowledge of and experience in the greater Washington, D.C. region to transform us into a leading owner and operator of office and business park properties in the region. We believe that we are well positioned for growth given our operational capabilities in the region and access to capital, together with the large number of properties that we believe meet our investment criteria.
Our investment strategy focuses on properties in our target markets that generally meet the following investment criteria:


• | high barrier-to-entry submarkets;


• | amenity rich and transportation friendly;


• | institutional quality, demonstrating liquidity in most points of the real estate cycle;


• | known employment areas; and/or


• | in-place cash flow.

We use our depth of local market knowledge to identify and opportunistically acquire and redevelop office buildings and business park properties. We also believe that our operational capabilities for professional property management and our transparency as a public company allow us to attract high-quality tenants to the properties that we acquire, leading, in some cases, to increased profitability and value for our properties. We also target properties that we believe can be converted, in whole or in part, to a higher use.
Competitive Advantages
We believe that our business strategy and operating model distinguish us from other owners, operators and acquirers of rental property in a number of ways, which include:

• | Experienced Management Team. Our three executive officers have over 50 years of cumulative real estate experience in the greater Washington, D.C. region;


• | Focused Strategy. We focus primarily on high-quality, multi-story office properties in the greater Washington, D.C. region. We believe that the greater Washington, D.C. region historically has been one of the largest, most stable markets in the U.S. for assets of this type;


• | Value-Add Management Approach. Through our hands-on approach to management, leasing, renovation and repositioning, we endeavor to add significant value to the properties that we acquire by improving tenant quality and increasing occupancy rates and net rent per square foot;


• | Local Market Knowledge. We have established relationships with local real estate owners, the brokerage community, prospective tenants and property managers in our markets. We believe that our market knowledge enhances our efforts to identify attractive acquisition opportunities and lease space in our properties; and


• | Diverse Tenant Mix. We believe our tenant base is highly diverse. Approximately 55% of our annualized cash basis rent is generated from our 25 largest tenants, and our largest 100 tenants generate approximately 79% of our annualized cash basis rent. The balance of our tenants, which is comprised of over 250 different companies, generates the remaining 21% of our annualized cash basis rent. We believe that our diversified tenant base provides a desirable mix of stability, diversity and growth potential.

Our Markets
We operate, acquire, develop and redevelop, office and business park properties in the greater Washington, D.C. region. Within this area, our primary market is the Washington, D.C. metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”), which includes Washington D.C., Northern Virginia and suburban Maryland. Additionally, we own and operate office and business park properties in the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News MSA, where our Southern Virginia properties are located, as well as in the Baltimore-Columbia-Towson MSA where the remainder of our Maryland properties are located (Annapolis and Columbia). We derive approximately 74.1% of our annualized cash basis rent from the Washington, D.C. MSA, 19.6% from Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News MSA, and the remaining 6.3% of our annualized cash basis rent comes from properties within the Baltimore-Columbia-Towson MSA.
According to data from Transwestern, a commercial real estate services provider, the Washington, D.C. MSA contains approximately 423 million square feet of office property and is the second largest office market in the country behind New York. The Washington, D.C. MSA office market totaled 2.3 million square feet of positive net absorption during 2016. The region also contains approximately 402 million square feet of flex/business park/industrial property, which is the smallest amongst the nation’s largest metro areas.
In 2016, the Washington, D.C. MSA was the sixth largest job market in the United States behind Los Angeles, New York, Dallas, San Francisco and Atlanta. Through November 2016, the D.C. MSA added more than 65,500 jobs, primarily in professional & business services, education & health, state & local government, and leisure & hospitality, according to the Transwestern / Delta Associates’ publication “TrendLines 2017, Investing in the Future”. The publication also stated that the Washington, D.C. MSA is estimated to add an annual average of 43,600 jobs from 2017 to 2021, with private sector firms leading the way. As of November 2016, the Washington D.C. MSA had an unemployment rate of 3.7%, the fifth lowest among its peer metropolitan areas, trailing only Boston, Denver, Dallas and San Francisco according to the Transwestern / Delta Associates’ publication.
The Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News MSA is our second largest market when measured by annualized cash basis rent and square footage. We own approximately 2 million square feet in the region and derive 19.6% of our annualized cash basis rent from the market. Norfolk is home to the largest military installation in the world, according to the United States Navy, and remains heavily invested in the defense and shipping industries, as it is the only NATO command on U.S. soil. In addition, the Norfolk port is the third largest port on the East Coast of the United States, has the deepest, obstruction-free channels available on the East Coast, and is the only East Coast port with Congressional authorization for 55-foot depth channels, according to the Virginia Port Authority.
The Baltimore-Columbia-Towson MSA is our smallest market when measured by annualized cash basis rent and square footage. We own approximately 470,000 square feet in the region and derive 6.3% of our annualized cash basis rent from the market. The properties that we own in the Baltimore-Columbia-Towson MSA are located in Columbia and Annapolis, Maryland. Columbia is a planned community that benefits from its strategic location between the cities of Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland. Columbia has consistently ranked in the top ten of CNN Money's “Best Places to Live in America”. Annapolis is the Maryland state capital and home to the U.S. Naval Academy. 
Competition
We compete with other real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), public and private real estate companies, private real estate investors and lenders, both domestic and foreign, in acquiring and developing properties. Many of these entities have greater resources than we do or other competitive advantages. We also face competition in leasing or subleasing available properties to prospective tenants.
We believe that our management’s experience and relationships in, and local knowledge of, the markets in which we operate put us at a competitive advantage when seeking acquisitions. However, many of our competitors have greater resources than we do, or may have a more flexible capital structure when seeking to finance acquisitions. We also face competition in leasing or subleasing available properties to prospective tenants. Some real estate operators may be willing to enter into leases at lower contractual rental rates (particularly if tenants, due to the economy, seek lower rents). However, we believe that our intensive management services are attractive to tenants and serve as a competitive advantage.

Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, a current or previous owner, operator or tenant of rental property may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases or threats of releases at such property, and may be held liable to a government entity or to third parties for natural resource damages, personal injury, property damage and for investigation, clean up and monitoring costs incurred by such parties in connection with the actual or threatened contamination. Such laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to fault, or whether or not the owner, operator or tenant knew of or caused the presence of the contamination. The liability under such laws may be joint and several for the full amount of the investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred or to be incurred or actions to be undertaken. These costs may be substantial, and can exceed the fair value of the property. The presence of contamination or the failure to properly remediate contamination on such property may adversely affect the ability of the owner, operator or tenant to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral, and may adversely impact our investment in a property.
Federal and state regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building’s management to identify and warn, via signs and labels, of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed asbestos-containing materials and potentially asbestos-containing materials in their building. The regulations also set forth employee training, record keeping and due diligence requirements pertaining to asbestos-containing materials and potentially asbestos-containing materials. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations. Building owners and those exercising control over a building’s management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits by workers and others exposed to asbestos-containing materials and potentially asbestos-containing materials. Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling and/or disposal of asbestos-containing materials. Such laws may impose liability for improper handling, exposure to or a release to the environment of asbestos-containing materials.
We also may incur liability arising from mold growth in the buildings we own or operate. When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or increase ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants, and others if property damage or personal injury occurs.
Prior to closing any property acquisition, if appropriate, we obtain such environmental assessments as may be prudent in order to attempt to identify potential environmental concerns at such properties. These assessments are carried out in accordance with an appropriate level of due diligence and generally may include a physical site inspection, a review of relevant federal, state and local environmental and health agency database records, one or more interviews with appropriate site-related personnel, review of the property’s chain of title and review of historic aerial photographs. We may also conduct limited subsurface investigations and test for substances of concern where the results of the first phase of the environmental assessments or other information, indicates possible contamination or where our consultants recommend such procedures.
We believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters. We have not been notified by any governmental authority of any material non-compliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matter in connection with any of our properties. See Item 1a, Risk Factors, for more information regarding potential environmental liabilities.
Employees
We had 120 employees as of February 17, 2017. We believe that relations with our employees are good.
