ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Global Seed Corporation was incorporated in the State of Texas on July 13, 2010. We had been engaged principally in the distribution of a monthly journal prior to our change in control consummated on June 2, 2018.
 
On May 21, 2018, Leung Kwok Hei, Chi Siu On, Leung Siu Hung and Chan Hiu (collectively, the “Purchasers”) entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with various holders (the “Sellers”) of the common stock of Global Seed Corporation, a Texas company (the “Company”). Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Sellers transferred to the Purchasers certain of their shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), or an aggregate of 4,492,000 shares of Common Stock (such transaction, the “Share Purchase”). The Share Purchase was closed on June 1, 2018.
 
At the closing of the Share Purchase, there was a change in our board and executive officers. Ms. Jia Tian, sole director, President, Treasurer and Secretary of the Company appointed Leung Kwok Hei to serve as director and Chief Executive Officer and Chan Hiu as director and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, with such appointment effective on June 1, 2018. Ms. Jia Tian resigned from all her positions with the Company effective on June 1, 2018.
 
Prior to our change in control, our product was the Global Seed Journal. It is a monthly journal published in Chinese for its presentation of Asian community news, advertising content, and articles written by contributors.
