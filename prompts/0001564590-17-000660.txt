Item 1. Business.
Overview
 8point3 Energy Partners LP is a Delaware limited partnership formed on March 3, 2015, by our general partner, 8point3 General Partner, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of 8point3 Holding Company, LLC (“Holdings”), a joint venture between First Solar, Inc. (“First Solar”) and SunPower Corporation (“SunPower” and collectively with First Solar, our “Sponsors”). We are a growth-oriented limited partnership formed to own, operate and acquire solar energy generation projects. On June 24, 2015, we completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 20,000,000 Class A shares. Our Class A shares representing limited partner interests in 8point3 Energy Partners LP are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “CAFD.” As of November 30, 2016, we owned a 35.5% limited liability interest in 8point3 Operating Company, LLC (“OpCo”), as well as a controlling non-economic managing member interest in OpCo. As of November 30, 2016, our Sponsors collectively own 51,000,000 Class B shares in the Partnership, with SunPower and First Solar owning 28,883,075 and 22,116,925 Class B shares, respectively, and together owning a noncontrolling 64.5% limited liability company interest in OpCo. 
 As of November 30, 2016, our Portfolio consisted of interests in 642 MW of solar energy projects. As of November 30, 2016, we owned interests in nine utility-scale solar energy projects, all of which are operational. As of November 30, 2016, we owned interests in four commercial and industrial (“C&I”) solar energy projects, two of which were operational and two of which were in late-stage construction, and a portfolio of residential DG Solar assets. Each utility-scale and C&I project in our Portfolio sells its energy output under long-term, fixed-price offtake agreements and our residential portfolios are comprised of solar installations which are leased to homeowners under a fixed monthly rate. Our operations comprise one reportable segment containing our Portfolio of solar energy projects. Please read Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 16—Segment Information.”
 Since November 30, 2015, we completed six acquisitions from our Sponsors, four from SunPower and two from First Solar.  On January 26, 2016, we entered into an agreement with SunPower to acquire a controlling interest in a solar energy project located in Kern County, California that has an aggregate nameplate capacity of up to 21 MW (the “Kern Project”) that is being effectuated in four phases, of which three phases occurred on or before November 30, 2016. On March 31, 2016, we acquired from First Solar a controlling interest in a 40 MW photovoltaic solar energy project also located in Kern County, California (the “Kingbird Project”). On April 1, 2016, we acquired from SunPower a controlling interest in a 50 MW photovoltaic solar energy project located in Alamosa County, Colorado (the “Hooper Project”). On July 1, 2016, we acquired from SunPower a controlling interest in a solar energy project which holds roof-mounted solar photovoltaic systems with an aggregate system size of approximately 5 MW, which are being installed at certain Macy’s department stores in Maryland (the “Macy’s Maryland Project”). On September 29, 2016, we acquired from SunPower a 49.0% interest in a 102 MW photovoltaic solar generating facility located in Kings County, California (the “Henrietta Project”). On December 1, 2016, we acquired from First Solar a 34.0% interest in a 300 MW photovoltaic solar generating facility located in San Bernardino, California (the “Stateline Project”).

Our Business Strategies
 Our primary objective is to generate predictable cash distributions that grow at a sustainable rate. We intend to achieve this objective through the following strategies:
 Own and operate long-term contracted solar generation assets
 We believe that contracted solar energy projects generate predictable cash flows. Solar power is generally sold under long-term offtake agreements that require the purchaser to acquire the power that is produced by the solar energy project. The principal factor affecting the amount of power produced is the level of sunlight reaching the project, which is largely predictable over the long term. Solar energy systems generate most of their electricity during the time of peak demand, when energy from the sun is strongest. In addition, solar energy projects contain limited operational and technology risks given their modular nature and minimum number of moving parts, which results in relatively low, stable and predictable operations and maintenance (“O&M”) expenses. We intend to continue to own and operate long-term contracted solar energy systems as we grow our business and project portfolio over time.
 Acquire assets in our target markets
 We intend to pursue strategic opportunities to grow our company through acquisitions, primarily from our Sponsors, of long-term contracted solar energy projects that have commenced, or are close to commencing, commercial operations and that have characteristics similar to our Portfolio, including reliable technology with relatively stable cash flows. Under the ROFO Agreements with our Sponsors, our Sponsors are required until June 24, 2020 to offer us the opportunity to purchase their interests in certain solar energy projects should they seek to sell such interests to a third party. Approximately three-fourths of our ROFO Portfolio consists of utility-scale solar energy projects located in the United States, and our current focus is on acquiring domestic assets. As of November 30, 2016, the weighted average remaining life of the offtake agreements for the currently contracted projects in our ROFO Portfolio is over 20 years. In addition, we have in the past, and we intend in the future, to work with our Sponsors to make adjustments to our ROFO Portfolio to better align it with our targeted long-term growth plan. We believe that by making strategic adjustments to our ROFO Portfolio, we can maintain both a conservative capital structure and our long term distribution growth targets. In addition to making acquisitions from the ROFO Portfolio, we seek to acquire solar assets with similar long-term contracted cash flow profiles primarily from our Sponsors and in some cases from other third-party developers and owners of solar energy systems. Please read Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 3—Business Combinations.”
 Capitalize on our Sponsors’ leading solar O&M services
 We benefit from our Sponsors’ vertically integrated business models across the solar value chain. We believe these business models enable our Sponsors to more effectively operate and maintain solar energy projects. Through various O&M agreements, each Sponsor, subject to oversight by the board of directors of our general partner, will continue to provide certain services to all but one of the contributed projects in our Portfolio, providing continuity and quality assurance of the O&M services. 
 Maintain a sound capital structure and financial flexibility
 We and our subsidiaries have various financing structures in place, including through tax equity financing arrangements, term loans, revolving credit facilities and a promissory note. We believe that our cash flow profile and the long-term nature of our contracts provide flexibility for optimizing our capital structure to increase distributions. We intend to continually evaluate opportunities to finance future acquisitions or refinance our existing debt, including through limited recourse project-level financings, and seek to limit recourse, optimize leverage, extend maturities and increase cash distributions to Class A shareholders over the long term.

Tax Equity Financing
 Most of our projects are financed using partnership structures with investors, known as tax equity investors, who can more efficiently monetize the value of the tax benefits, primarily Investment Tax Credits (“ITCs”) and accelerated depreciation that support solar energy projects in the United States. These partnership structures usually allocate tax and cash items disproportionately to the share of the project capital contributed by the tax equity investor and OpCo.  These partnership structures are designed to effectively allocate project attributes (e.g., tax benefits, cash flows and residual value) to the party best suited to monetize the attributes.  Often these partnerships are structured with allocations that change over time or as the tax equity investor realizes its projected return on investment and are known as “flip partnerships.”   Partnership allocations vary by project based on specific project characteristics and investor preferences. 
 For each of the Solar Gen 2 Project, the Lost Hills Blackwell Project, the North Star Project and the Henrietta Project, a modified flip partnership structure was utilized that distributes available cash on the basis of 51% to the tax equity investor and 49% to OpCo. 
 The flip partnership structures employed on the Kern Project, the Kingbird Project, the Hooper Project, the Macy’s California Project, the Macy’s Maryland Project, the Quinto Project, the RPU Project and the UC Davis Project allocate a certain share of project cash flow to OpCo pursuant to the project-specific distribution waterfall applicable to the project. Pursuant to each of these distribution waterfalls, the tax equity investor is entitled to a monthly or quarterly amount of project cash flow until a specified “flip” point is achieved.  After the “flip” point, the cash allocations to OpCo are expected to generally increase.  In addition, upon reaching the flip point, OpCo has a right to purchase the tax equity investor’s interests in the project for an amount that is not less than its fair market value.
 The Maryland Solar Project Entity has leased the Maryland Solar Project to an affiliate of First Solar, with the lease term expiring on December 31, 2019 (unless terminated earlier pursuant to its terms). Under the arrangement, First Solar’s affiliate is obligated to pay a fixed amount of rent that is set based on the expected operations of the plant. Upon expiration of this lease, we will directly benefit from the operating results of the Maryland Solar Project. Please read Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Project Agreements—We rely on a limited number of offtake counterparties and we are exposed to the risk that they are unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to us or that they otherwise terminate their offtake agreements with us.”
 Under these tax equity financing structures, a tax equity investor may be entitled to indemnification or to a diversion to it of distributable cash from a project in order to compensate the tax equity investor (i) for a breach of representation, warranty or covenant made to it in connection with its tax equity investment, (ii) for a reduction in or change in allocation of ITCs, tax basis, fair market value or other tax-related matters on which its investment was based or (iii) with respect to tax equity arrangements where the determination of the flip date is based on the tax equity investor achieving a target after-tax internal rate of return, for a delay in achieving the target return due to a change in federal tax law that results in a reduction in the applicable corporate tax rate (which could reduce the value of depreciation deductions), a reduction in available ITCs or a change to available depreciations deductions . Except for indemnification or diversion caused by OpCo or diversions resulting from corporate tax rate reductions, OpCo is entitled to indemnification under the Omnibus Agreement for payments made to a tax equity investor in respect of indemnification or diversion obligations that arise under clauses (i) or (ii) above.

ROFO Projects
 Our Sponsors have granted us rights of first offer on certain of their solar energy projects that are currently contracted or are expected to be contracted prior to being sold, should our Sponsors decide to sell such projects before June 24, 2020. Our ROFO Agreements include assets similar to the projects in our Portfolio and represent interests in 1,200 MW capacity as of November 30, 2016. In the year ended November 30, 2016, we and our Sponsors agreed to make several adjustments to our ROFO Portfolio to better align it with our targeted long-term growth plan. We intend in the future to work with our Sponsors to continue to make adjustments to our ROFO Portfolio, including to remove projects that we do not intend to acquire at the time our Sponsors plan to offer them, as necessary to meet our objectives.  
 The following table provides a brief description of the ROFO Projects as of November 30, 2016:

Utility Projects
 Typical Project Agreements
 Our Utility Project Entities have entered into agreements that are customary for utility-scale solar energy projects. These include agreements for energy sales, interconnection, construction, equipment supply, O&M services, asset management services and real estate rights, among others. Our Utility Project Entities have also secured necessary and customary project permits.
 Power Purchase Agreements.    Our Utility Project Entities have entered into offtake agreements under which each Utility Project Entity generally receives a fixed price over the term of the offtake agreement with respect to 100% of its output, subject in some cases to annual escalations and/or time of delivery adjustments. Such offtake agreements are designed to provide a stable and predictable revenue stream.
 17


Under our Utility Project Entities’ offtake agreements, each party typically has the right to terminate upon written notice ranging from ten to 60 days following the occurrence of an event of default that has not been cured within the applicable cure period, if any. In addition, following an uncured event of default under an offtake agreement by the applicable offtake counterparty, the applicable Utility Project Entity may withhold amounts due to such offtake counterparty, suspend performance, receive payment for damages and, in most cases, receive termination payments from the applicable offtake counterparty or pursue other remedies available at law or in equity. Events of default under these offtake agreements typically include:
  
• | failure to pay amounts due;
--+----------------------------


• | bankruptcy proceedings;
--+------------------------


• | failure to provide certain credit support;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | failure to hold necessary licenses or permits; and
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | breach of material obligations.
--+--------------------------------

 Our Utility Project Entities’ offtake agreements have certain availability or production requirements, and if such requirements are not met, then in some cases the applicable Utility Project Entity is required to pay the offtake counterparty a specified damages amount. In addition, such failure, in certain cases, may give the offtake counterparty a right to terminate the offtake agreement or reduce the contract quantity. Certain obligations (other than payment obligations) under our offtake agreements may be excused by force majeure events, and in some cases, the offtake agreement may be terminated if any such force majeure event continues for a continuous period of between 12 and 36 months (depending on the offtake agreement).
 Interconnection Agreements.    We depend on interconnection and transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the energy from our utility projects. As such, our Utility Project Entities or their affiliates have entered into interconnection agreements with large regional utility companies, local distribution companies or independent system operators, which allow our projects to connect to the energy transmission system or, in some cases, to a distribution system. The interconnection agreements define the cost allocation and schedule for interconnection, as well as any upgrades required to connect the project to the transmission system or distribution system, as applicable.
 Construction and Equipment Supply Agreements.    Our Utility Project Entities have entered into construction agreements with qualified contractors and equipment supply agreements with industry leading suppliers, including our Sponsors. In addition to setting forth the terms and conditions of construction or equipment delivery, as applicable, our Utility Project Entities receive system-wide warranties and product warranties for the major equipment pursuant to these construction and equipment supply agreements (which vary in coverage and length by project).
 O&M Agreements and Asset Management Agreements (“AMAs”).    Our Utility Project Entities and certain other subsidiaries have entered into O&M agreements and AMAs with First Solar or SunPower affiliates, as applicable (except where such persons are otherwise subject to O&M agreements or AMAs with unaffiliated third parties). Under the terms of the O&M agreements and AMAs, such affiliates have agreed to provide a variety of operation, maintenance and asset management services, and certain performance warranties or availability guarantees, to our Utility Project Entities in exchange for fixed annual fees, which are subject to certain adjustments. For a detailed description of the terms of the O&M agreements and AMAs applicable to our projects, please read Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.”
 Real Estate Rights.    Our Utility Project Entities and certain other subsidiaries have secured real property interests and access rights that we believe will allow our utility projects in our Portfolio to operate without material real estate claims until the expiration of the initial terms of applicable offtake agreements.
Our Utility Projects
 Henrietta
 The Henrietta Project Entity owns the 102 MW Henrietta Project. The Henrietta Project achieved commercial operation on October 1, 2016. Effective September 29, 2016, we indirectly control 100% of the class B membership interests in Parrey Holding Company, LLC (“Henrietta Holdings”), the indirect owner of 100% of the limited liability company membership interests of the Henrietta Project Entity. Such class B membership interests in Henrietta Holdings entitle us to a 49% economic interest and initially 1% of the tax allocations and the net income or loss of the Henrietta Project Entity. A subsidiary of Southern Company acts as the class A member of Henrietta Holdings. The class A member owns a 51% economic interest and initially 99% of the tax allocations and the net income or loss of the Henrietta Project Entity. After the Henrietta Project has been operational for approximately fifteen years, the allocation of tax-related items between the class A and class B members of Henrietta Holdings will shift to match the 
 18


economic interests. An affiliate of the class A member has managerial responsibilities, subject to the class A members’ and the class B members’ approval rights with respect to certain decisions, including expenditures in excess of budgeted amounts, certain sales of assets, execution, termination or amendment of certain contracts and the incurrence of debt. The Henrietta Project is located on leased property pursuant to a ground lease and ancillary beneficial easements executed on August 7, 2015, which provide the Henrietta Project Entity with an initial 31 years of site control and the ability to extend the lease term up to two additional five-year terms. 
 Hooper Project

 C&I Projects
 Typical Project Agreements
 Our C&I Project Entities have entered into agreements that are customary for C&I solar energy projects. These include agreements for energy sales, construction, equipment supply, O&M services, asset management services, and real estate rights. Our C&I Project Entities have also secured necessary and customary construction and operating permits.
 Power Purchase Agreements.    Our C&I Project Entities have entered into offtake agreements under which each C&I Project Entity generally receives a fixed price over the term of the offtake agreement with respect to 100% of its output (except as otherwise set forth in the project descriptions below). Such offtake agreements are designed to provide a stable and predictable revenue stream.
 Under our C&I Project Entities’ offtake agreements, each party typically has the right to terminate upon written notice ranging from ten to 30 days following the occurrence of an event of default that has not been cured within the applicable cure period, if any. In addition, following an uncured event of default under an offtake agreement by the applicable offtake counterparty, the applicable C&I Project Entities may in most cases, receive termination payments from the applicable offtake counterparty or pursue other remedies available at law or in equity. Events of default under these offtake agreements typically include:
  
• | failure to pay amounts due;
--+----------------------------


• | bankruptcy proceedings;
--+------------------------


• | failure to provide certain credit support; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | breach of material obligations.
--+--------------------------------

 Certain of our C&I Project Entities’ offtake agreements have availability or production requirements, and if such requirements are not met, the offtake counterparty has the right to terminate the offtake agreement. Additionally, the obligations (other than payment obligations) of each party under our offtake agreements may be excused by force majeure events, and in some cases, the agreement may be terminated if the force majeure events continue for a continuous period of 12 months.
 Interconnection Agreements.    Our C&I Project Entities’ projects interconnect with the applicable offtake customer’s facilities. In certain cases, the counterparties under our offtake agreements or their affiliates have entered into interconnection agreements with large regional utility companies or local distribution companies allowing our applicable project to operate in parallel with their distribution system.
 Construction and Equipment Supply Agreements.    Our C&I Project Entities have entered into engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) agreements with a SunPower affiliate. In addition to setting forth the terms and conditions of construction or equipment delivery, as applicable, our C&I Project Entities receive a 25-year power and product warranty on the modules and a 2- to 10-year warranty on the system.
 22


O&M and Asset Management.    Our C&I Project Entities and certain other subsidiaries have entered into O&M agreements and AMAs with SunPower affiliates. Under the terms of the O&M agreements and AMAs, such affiliates agreed to provide a variety of operation, maintenance and asset management services and certain performance warranties to our C&I Project Entities in exchange for a fixed annual fee, subject to certain adjustments. For a detailed description of the terms of the O&M agreements and AMAs applicable to our projects, please read Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.”
 Real Estate Rights.    Our C&I Project Entities and certain other subsidiaries have secured real property interests and access rights that allow our C&I projects in our Portfolio to operate without material real estate claims until the expiration of the initial terms of applicable offtake agreements, which in some cases are extendable in connection with an extension of the applicable offtake agreements.

 Green attributes retained by the Macy’s Maryland Project Entity pursuant to the 20-year power purchase agreement for the Macy’s Maryland Project are sold to Noble Americas Gas & Power Corporation through December 31, 2020 at a stated contract price, which remains fixed throughout the term, pursuant to a five-year purchase agreement. 
 UC Davis Project
 The UC Davis Project is comprised of a 13 MW solar generation facility located in Solano County, California, which commenced operations in September 2015. The UC Davis Project is situated on a 62-acre site leased by the Regents of the University of California (the “University”) pursuant to a ground lease agreement that is coterminous with the 20-year power purchase agreement for the UC Davis Project. C&I Holdings is the owner of 100% of the limited liability company membership interests of the UC Davis Project Entity.  As such, distributions of cash flows and management of the UC Davis Project are the same that those of the Macy’s California Project, which are set forth above. 
Residential Portfolio
 Overview.    Our Residential Portfolio is comprised of residential solar energy systems with an aggregate of 39 MW of capacity and an average solar energy system capacity of approximately 7.95 kW. Our Residential Portfolio is comprised of approximately 5,900 solar installations located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont. We own 100% of the membership interest in the Residential Portfolio Project Entity that owns these residential solar systems. These residential solar energy systems are leased to our customers under long-term lease agreements.
 Lease Agreements.    A typical lease term is for 20 years and homeowners are obligated to make lease payments to us on a monthly basis. The customer’s monthly payment is fixed based on a calculation that takes into account expected solar energy generation, and certain of our current customer contracts contain price escalators with an average increase of 1% annually. The lease includes a performance warranty under which we agree to make a payment to the customer if the leased system does not meet the guaranteed performance level. Over the term of the lease, we operate and maintain the system. Customers are eligible to purchase their leased solar systems to facilitate the sale or transfer of their homes. The leases also include an early buy-out option, at no less than fair market value, exercisable in the seventh year that allows customers to purchase the solar system.
 Operations & Maintenance.    SunPower Corporation, Systems, a wholly owned subsidiary of SunPower (“SunPower Systems”) maintains the Residential Portfolio, including performing system monitoring and preventative and corrective maintenance. The O&M term is concurrent with each customer lease in the Residential Portfolio.

SunPower is majority owned by Total S.A., the fifth largest publicly-listed energy company in the world.
 Seasonality
 The amount of electricity our solar energy systems produce is dependent in part on the amount of sunlight, or irradiation, where the assets are located. Because shorter daylight hours in winter months results in less irradiation, the generation of particular assets will vary depending on the season.
 Our power generation is expected to be at its lowest during the winter season of each year. Similarly, our first quarter revenue generation is expected to be lower than other quarters. We reserve a portion of our cash available for distribution and maintain a revolving credit facility in order to, among other things, facilitate the payment of distributions to our Class A shareholders. As a result, we do not expect seasonality to have a material effect on the amount of our quarterly distributions.
 Competition
 We operate in a capital-intensive industry that is currently highly fragmented and diverse, with numerous industry participants. We compete on the basis of contract price and terms, as well as the location of our projects. There is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, scale and scope of the companies with which we compete. We have numerous competitors with a varied mix of characteristics including our Sponsors and growth vehicles similar to us that seek to acquire energy projects from our Sponsors or third parties, as well as other renewable and conventional power generation companies. In addition, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by energy legislation and regulation considered from time to time by federal, state and local legislatures and administrative agencies. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of acquiring, constructing and operating solar energy projects, and some of our competitors may be better able to adapt to and operate under such laws and regulations.
Environmental Matters
 We are required to comply with various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These existing and future laws and regulations may impact existing and new solar energy projects, require us to obtain and maintain permits and approvals, comply with all environmental laws and regulations applicable within each jurisdiction and implement environmental, health and safety programs and procedures to monitor and control risks associated with the construction, operation and decommissioning of regulated or permitted solar energy systems, all of which involve a significant investment of time and resources.
 We also incur costs in the ordinary course of business to comply with these laws, regulations and permit requirements. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations frequently change, and often become more stringent or subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement. Such changes in environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could require us to incur materially higher costs, or cause a costly interruption of operations due to delays in obtaining new or amended permits.
 The failure of our operations to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permit requirements may result in administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory, cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations and issuance of injunctions to limit, suspend or cease operations.
 In addition, claims by third parties for damages to persons or property, or for injunctive relief, have been brought in the past, and may be brought in the future as a result of alleged environmental, and health and safety impacts associated with our activities.
 To operate our projects, we are required to obtain from federal, state and local governmental authorities a range of environmental permits and other approvals, including those described below. In addition to being subject to these regulatory requirements, we have experienced significant opposition from private third parties during the permit application process or in subsequent permit appeal proceedings.
 Clean Water Act.    Our projects may be covered under federal Clean Water Act regulations to prevent or contain expected discharges of pollutants or dredged and fill materials into state waters as well as waters of the United States, including adjacent wetlands. On June 29, 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) published a final rule that made changes to the EPA’s definition of “waters of the United States.” Various states have filed lawsuits challenging the rule and, in October 2015, the 
 26


U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an order that temporarily stays implementation of the rule nationwide pending the outcome of the various legal challenges. We are currently assessing the potential impact of the EPA’s final rule on our operations, as any expansion to Clean Water Act jurisdiction could impose additional obligations on our operations.
 BLM Right-of-Way Grants.    Some of our projects are located, or partially located, and projects that we acquire in the future may be located, on lands administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”). Therefore, we may be required to obtain and maintain BLM right-of-way grants for access to, or operations on, such lands. Obtaining and maintaining a grant requires that the project conduct environmental reviews (discussed below) and implement a plan of development and demonstrate compliance with the plan to protect the environment, including potentially expensive measures to protect biological, archeological and cultural resources encountered on the grant.
 Environmental Reviews.    Solar energy projects may be subject to federal, state, or local environmental reviews, where a broad array of the solar energy project’s potential environmental impacts is assessed. Compliance with the environmental review process can be time-consuming and expensive, and generally requires public comment periods, which may open a proposed project up to adverse comments, protests or appeals. Furthermore, an agency may decide to deny a permit based on such an environmental review, or an agency may require environmental mitigation measures to offset any identified impacts. Although we do not expect any delays in implementing our growth strategy because of such environmental reviews, they may extend the time and/or increase the costs for obtaining necessary governmental approvals.
 Endangered and Protected Species.    Federal agencies considering the permit applications for our projects are required to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the “USFWS”) to consider the impact on potentially affected endangered and threatened species and their habitats under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”). Our projects are also required to comply with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (the “MBTA”) and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (the “BGEPA”). Because the operation of solar energy projects could result in harm to endangered species or their habitats, or could result in injury or fatalities to protected birds, federal and state agencies may require ongoing monitoring, mitigation activities, or financial compensation as a condition to issuing a permit for a project. Violations of the ESA, MBTA, BGEPA and similar state laws may result in fines, penalties, criminal sanctions or injunctions, including the possibility of curtailment or shutdown.
 Historic Preservation.    State and federal agencies may, under the National Historic Preservation Act or similar law, require our projects to protect historic, archaeological, or religious or cultural resources located or discovered near or on our project sites. Ongoing monitoring, mitigation activities, or financial compensation may be required as a condition of conducting project operations.
 Clean Air Act/Climate Change.    In the past few years, the EPA has taken various actions to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. For example, on August 3, 2015, the EPA finalized its Clean Power Plan, which establishes standards to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power generation facilities by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030. On February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court stayed implementation of the Clean Power Plan until the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in the lawsuit brought against the plan. The case remains pending before the D.C. Circuit court.  If, in implementing the Clean Power Plan or any new or revised regulatory program aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector, federal, state or local governments repealed or altered the incentives currently provided for renewable energy generation, it could adversely affect the attractiveness of renewable energy investments and therefore adversely impact, perhaps materially, our business, growth strategy, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; however, to the extent that renewable energy is competing with higher greenhouse gas emitting energy sources, renewable energy would become more desirable.Hazardous Waste.    We own and lease real property and may be subject to requirements regarding the management, disposal and remediation of prior contamination associated with the release of petroleum products and/or toxic or hazardous substances. These regulations include the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and analogous state laws. If our owned or leased properties are contaminated, whether during or prior to our ownership or operation, we could be responsible for the costs of investigation and cleanup and for any related liabilities, including claims for damage to property, persons or natural resources. That responsibility may arise even if we were not at fault and did not cause or were not aware of the contamination. In addition, waste we generate is at times sent to third party disposal facilities. If those facilities become contaminated, we and any other persons who arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at those sites may be jointly and severally responsible for the costs of investigation and remediation, as well as for any claims for damage to third parties, their property or natural resources. We may incur significant costs in the future if we become responsible for the investigation or remediation of hazardous substances at our owned or leased properties or at third party disposal facilities.
 Local Regulations.    Our operations are subject to local environmental and land use requirements, including county and municipal land use, zoning, building, water use, and transportation requirements. Permitting at the local municipal or county level often consists of obtaining a special use or conditional use permit under a land use ordinance or code, or, in some cases, rezoning in 
 27


connection with the solar energy project. Obtaining or maintaining a permit often requires us to demonstrate that the solar energy project will conform to development standards specified under the ordinance so that the solar energy project is compatible with existing land uses and protects natural and human environments. Local or state regulatory agencies may require modeling, testing, and, where applicable, ongoing mitigation of radar and other microwave interference in connection with the permitting and approval process. Local or state agencies also may require decommissioning plans and the establishment of financial assurance mechanisms for carrying out the decommissioning plan. 
 Safety and Maintenance
 We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.
 We perform preventive and normal maintenance on all of our projects and make repairs and replacements when necessary or appropriate. We also conduct routine and required inspections of those projects in accordance with applicable regulation.
 Regulatory Matters
 As owners of contracted solar energy projects and participants in wholesale energy markets, our Project Entities are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These include the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) and public utility commissions in states where our generating projects are located. In addition, some of our Project Entities are subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various regional transmission organization and independent system operator markets in which they participate.
Federal Power Act
 Section 205 of the U.S. Federal Power Act (the “FPA”) requires public utilities to obtain FERC’s approval of their rates for the wholesale sale of energy. Some of our Project Entities are public utilities, and each such entity has been granted authority by FERC to sell electricity at market-based rates, rather than on a traditional cost-of-service basis.
 The FPA also gives FERC jurisdiction to review certain other activities of our Project Entities. In particular:
  
• | Section 203 of the FPA requires FERC’s prior approval for any direct or indirect change of control over a public utility or its jurisdictional assets, unless otherwise granted authorization by FERC. In January 2016, FERC issued a declaratory order disclaiming jurisdiction under FPA Section 203 with respect to sales and purchases of our shares and determining that our shares are passive, non-voting securities that will not allow any shareholders to exercise control over our public utility subsidiaries.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Section 204 of the FPA gives FERC jurisdiction over a public utility’s issuance of securities or its assumption of liabilities, subject to certain exceptions. However, FERC typically grants blanket approval for security issuances and the assumption of liabilities to public utilities having market-based rate authority. All of our Project Entities that are public utilities have received such blanket approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In accordance with Section 215 of the FPA, FERC has approved the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”) as the national Electric Reliability Organization (“ERO”) for North America. As the ERO, NERC is responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards for the wholesale electric power system directly and through regional reliability organizations. Each of our Project Entities is required under the FPA to comply with NERC requirements and the requirements of the regional reliability entity for the region in which it is located.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005
 The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (“PUHCA 2005”) provides FERC with certain authority over and access to books and records of public utility holding companies and their subsidiaries that are not otherwise exempt from such requirements. We are a public utility holding company, but because all of our Utility Project Entities are either “Exempt Wholesale Generators” or “Qualifying Facilities,” as defined for purposes of PUHCA 2005, we are exempt from all of the FERC accounting, record retention 
 28


and reporting requirements of the PUHCA 2005. We and our Project Entities are subject to state utility commission access to books and records under PUHCA 2005 in certain limited circumstances.
 Government Incentives
 U.S. federal, state and local governments have supported incentives to enhance industry growth and development of cost-competitive, self-sustaining renewable energy generation. These include tax incentives, regulatory programs, and net metering policies. Federal tax incentives have historically been financed through tax equity transactions in which owners of renewable energy facilities utilize tax credits through partnerships with third-party investors.
 Federal income tax incentives for equipment which uses solar energy to generate electricity include:
  
• | The Investment Tax Credit: ITC is a tax credit equal to a percentage of the basis of the eligible solar equipment at the commencement of construction (but subject to being placed into service by January 1, 2024) for tax purposes: 30% for eligible solar facilities that commence construction prior to January 1, 2020; 26% for eligible solar facilities that commence construction during 2020; 22% for eligible solar facilities that commence construction during 2021; and 10% for solar facilities that commence construction in 2022 or thereafter. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Modified Accelerated Cost-Recovery System Depreciation: Under MACRS depreciation, owners of the eligible solar equipment claim all of their depreciation deductions for tax purposes with respect to the equipment over five years, even though the useful economic life of such equipment is greater than five years. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Bonus Depreciation: Under the “Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015,” which was signed into law December 18, 2015, owners of eligible solar equipment can claim bonus depreciation for qualified property acquired and placed in service during 2015 through 2019. The bonus depreciation percentage is 50% of the tax depreciable basis for property placed in service during 2015, 2016 and 2017 and phases down, with 40% in 2018, and 30% in 2019. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Key state and local programs and incentives include:
  
• | State Renewable Portfolio Standards: Renewable Portfolio Standards (“RPS”) programs are state regulatory programs created by state legislatures to support growth in renewable energy by mandating that electric power providers produce or purchase certain levels of power from renewable sources. 29 states and the District of Columbia currently have an RPS program in place and nine other states have non-binding goals supporting renewable energy. Most states with mandatory RPS programs typically set a target between 10% and 30% of total energy capacity by a specific date, while other states set a MW target to achieve their RPS goals. RPS programs are expected to continue serving as drivers of U.S. renewable energy growth. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Net Metering: Net metering is a policy adopted by various states and utilities that provides customers who own grid-connected distributed generation solar (“DG Solar”) assets with the ability to pay the utility only for electricity net of electricity generated by the customer’s solar system. Typically, customers receive a credit for any excess production on their regular utility bills. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Renewable Energy Certificates: Renewable energy certificates (“RECs”) supplement RPS programs by allowing electric power providers to purchase levels of renewable energy generation that can be used to fulfill state mandates relating to renewable energy. RECs are purchased and traded separately from the underlying electricity generation in states that have authorized them.
