Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a leading provider of insight-driven performance improvement solutions to the rapidly changing health care and education industries. Through our subscription-based membership programs, software, data-enabled services, and consulting capabilities, we leverage our intellectual capital to help our clients, which we refer to as our members, solve their most critical business problems. As of the date of this report, we served approximately 5,600 members. 
We provide members with best-practice industry research, and insights that they need to thrive in a dynamic market. We then help to guide and support our members in the implementation of these best practices through proprietary, high-value technology, services, and consulting capabilities. All of our programs are rooted in best practices and extend across four key areas:

• | Best practices research. Our best practices research and insight programs provide the foundation for all of our other programs. These programs are focused on understanding industry dynamics, identifying best-demonstrated management practices, critically evaluating widely-followed but ineffective practices, and analyzing emerging trends within the health care and education industries. We communicate and teach best practices across our broad network through independent forums for each key leadership constituency.


• | Technology. Our cloud-based software applications allow members to combine insights derived from our best practices research with their own operational and financial data and third-party and proprietary data to benchmark performance; identify and assess revenue, cost, quality, and performance improvement opportunities; and implement identified best practices.


• | Data-enabled services. We draw on our extensive data assets, distinctive technology platforms, proven processes, and deep expertise gained over years of experience to apply best practices and enablement services to directly produce results for our members.


• | Consulting services. Our consulting services programs assist our members’ own efforts to set strategic direction, address key operational challenges, and improve their performance. We deploy our experts to work side-by-side with members implementing best practice solutions and driving change in their organizations.

Corporate Information
We were incorporated in Maryland in 1979 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2001. The mailing address of our principal executive offices is 2445 M Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20037, and our telephone number is (202) 266-5600.
We maintain a corporate Internet website at www.advisoryboardcompany.com. We make available free of charge through our website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish the reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. The contents of our website are not a part of this annual report on Form 10-K.
Our Markets
Across our more than 35-year history, we have focused on providing insight-driven, differentiated, scalable, and renewable solutions to the rapidly transforming health care and education industries. Within the health care market, we primarily serve U.S. hospitals and health systems, and also sell programs to international hospitals, independent medical groups, post-acute care facilities, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device companies, as well as to health care insurers and other service providers. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimated that spending in the United States for health care services was expected to be approximately $3.4 trillion in 2016, or approximately 18.1% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and was expected to grow to over $5.5 trillion, or 19.9% of GDP, by 2025. 
1

Within the education market, we serve a range of public and private colleges, universities, and K-12 schools. The U.S. Department of Education estimates education institutions to be a $1.2 trillion market involving the participation of more than 85.7 million students and more than 136,000 institutions, including both degree-granting and other education organizations.
Both health care and education organizations rely on external service providers to help them develop strategies, consolidate and analyze data, improve operations and processes, and train staff in order to remain competitive in a dynamic industry environment. We believe that certain characteristics of the health care and education industries make them especially suited for our business model of standardized delivery of services and software rooted in shared best practices:

• | Undergoing transformation: Both the health care and education industries are undergoing tremendous change. Health care providers are facing an aging population, increasing cost and margin pressures, new regulations related to the Affordable Care Act and now the potential amendment or repeal of certain components of the Affordable Care Act, and movement from fee-for-service to value-based reimbursement. Colleges and universities are confronting a slower growing student population, shrinking state budgets, rising cost concerns, heightened attention to value and outcomes, and a movement towards performance-based funding. During these times of significant change, health care and education institutions are in greater need of, and are actively seeking, best practices to address their mounting challenges.


• | Common and complex industry-wide issues: Health care and education organizations of all types and sizes face many of the same complex strategic, operational, and management issues. Institutions are working to increase revenue, reduce costs, improve productivity and performance, manage innovation, reengineer business processes, and comply with new government regulations. Because the delivery of health care and education services is based on complex, interrelated processes, there is widespread interest in, and broad applicability of, standardized programs that address the major challenges facing the industries.


• | Fragmented target industries: We believe that our target market consists of over 15,000 health care organizations and over 5,000 education institutions. Many of these organizations deliver services primarily on a local or regional basis. As a result of this fragmentation, best practices that are pioneered in local or regional markets are rarely widely known throughout the industry.


• | Willingness to share best practices: We believe that health care and education organizations display a relatively high propensity to share best practices. Many health systems and universities are non-profit organizations or compete in a limited geographic market and do not consider organizations outside their market to be their competitors. In addition, the health care and education industries have a charter above commerce in serving their communities and their end customers, and have a long tradition of disseminating information as part of ongoing research and education activities.


• | Need for data and analytics: Health care data resides in numerous source systems both within and dispersed across a variety of organizations, including hospitals, physician practices, and government and commercial payers. Education data similarly is derived from a broad range of sources, which encompass students, parents, employers, high schools, colleges and universities, and other non-traditional education institutions. To achieve higher-quality outcomes and control costs, organizations within these markets exhibit a strong and continuing need for data and the systematic analysis of data to help them understand their current performance and identify opportunities for improvement.


• | Value orientation: A membership model that provides access to best practice insight, software applications, and value-added services on a syndicated basis appeals to many value-focused health care and education organizations that may be reluctant to make discretionary investments in an exclusive, higher-priced, customized engagement or tailored software solution to address their critical issues.

Our Strengths
We are a mission-driven organization with core values, a service ethic, and a results-oriented approach dedicated to helping health care and education institutions solve their most pressing problems. Our competitive strengths include the following:

• | Market leader in rapidly changing markets. We are a market leader in both the health care and education markets, serving executives at more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals and health systems since 1986 and over 1,100 U.S. colleges and universities since 2007. The ongoing transformation of these industries is presenting new challenges and creating demand for new programs and services. We believe our reputation and success to date have positioned us as a premier source and partner for identifying, evaluating, communicating, and providing solutions that respond to evolving market needs.

• | A superior value proposition to members. Members use our programs to improve the effectiveness of their organizations by increasing productivity, reducing operating costs, and enhancing revenue. We believe that our program costs generally represent a small percentage of the potential benefit members can achieve through successful application of the best practices research, software, and consulting that they receive. In fact, we generated over $2.0 billion in documented value for our members. In addition, our fixed-fee pricing for research and software promotes frequent use of our programs by our members, which we believe increases both the value members receive and their loyalty to our programs.


• | Extensive membership base and longstanding member relationships. Our membership includes some of the largest and most prestigious health care and education institutions in the United States, including all 20 of the 2016-2017 U.S. News and World Report honor roll hospitals and 91 of the U.S. News and World Report’s top 100 national universities for 2017. Our programs reach more than 10,000 chief executive and chief operating officers, and over 300,000 other senior executives, operational and clinical leaders, department heads, and product-line managers. Our membership-based model, in which members participate in our research on an annual basis, gives us privileged access to our members’ business practices, proprietary data, and strategic plans, enabling us not only to identify and share emerging best practices but also to develop first-in-class and best-in-class new programs and services to meet our members’ changing needs.


• | Broad, insight-driven offerings. We provide a distinctively broad and deep set of best practices research, technology programs, data-enabled services, and consulting services, allowing us to assist our members in a variety of ways depending on their specific needs and problem areas. Our health care programs address key areas where hospitals and health systems require comprehensive and continuous support to address perennial challenges, including: driving health system growth, reducing care variation, and optimizing the revenue cycle. Our education programs focus on topics that include enrollment management, student success, academic programming, faculty productivity, and advancement. Our technology programs and data-enabled services differ from those of most of our competitors in that they are rooted in best practices, aggregate and standardize data from disparate source systems, and are part of a complementary platform of offerings.


• | Highly recurring, visible, and scalable business model. We derive the majority of our revenue from multi-year memberships across our distinct programs. Our member renewal rate for our research and software programs has equaled or exceeded 90% for each of the twelve-month fiscal periods in the five year period ended December 31, 2016, which we believe reflects our members’ recognition of the value they derive from participating in our programs. In addition, we can identify over 80% of our expected annual revenues at the beginning of the fiscal year based on our deferred revenue balance and historical program renewal trends. Our economic model, which features a standardized set of services and a largely fixed-cost structure, enables us to add new members to our programs at a low incremental cost of delivery, thereby disproportionately increasing operating profit for our members.


• | Consistent financial performance and strong cash flows. Since becoming a public company in 2001, we have increased our number of members, contract value per member, total contract value, and revenue nearly every year, including during economic downturns. Since March 31, 2012, our number of members has grown from 3,726 to 5,633, while our contract value per member has expanded from approximately $107,000 to approximately $140,000. The combination of revenue growth, profitable operations, and payment for memberships in advance of accrual revenue typically results in our cash flows from operations exceeding our net income and often approximating our adjusted EBITDA.

Growth Strategy
We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the favorable characteristics in our target markets and deploy our competitive strengths to continue growing our business. As part of our growth strategy, we plan to:

• | Add new health care and education members. We believe there are over 15,000 potential members in the health care market and over 5,000 potential members in the education market. Although we currently have an established membership base in these markets, we actively seek to continue adding new members. In addition, we believe that our business model and existing membership base represent significant assets that we can use to attract additional non-provider health care members and international health care and education members. We currently serve approximately 400 non-U.S. health care organizations through programs that rely on research and analysis primarily derived from our work with U.S. health care organizations. In addition, we are seeking to expand our work with independent medical groups, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, and health insurance companies, as well as with other organizations with an interest in U.S. hospital and health system operations, performance, and data.


• | Expand relationships with and create additional value for existing members. We have developed broad and deep relationships with approximately 4,400 members and over 200,000 executives across our health care programs, and approximately 1,100 members and over 80,000 executives across our education programs. As members recognize benefits from one program, they may seek out or become strong candidates for other programs and services. In addition, our steady interaction with members through research, sales, program development and delivery, and account management provides us with insight into which of our programs would be most suitable for them. Since 2011, we have increased contract value per member by 47%, from approximately $95,000 to approximately $140,000 as of December 31, 2016, by selling additional programs to existing members and adding new members. The average contract value is approximately $124,000 per health care member and approximately $193,000 per education member. This average contract value continues to remain a small portion of many institutions’ total expenditures on professional services per year.


• | Continue innovating through member-driven product development. As our markets rapidly evolve, we seek to expand our portfolio of programs and services through development of new programs and successful execution and integration of acquisitions and strategic partnerships. Each year, we pursue a rigorous research process involving extensive member feedback, in which we build a large pipeline of potential new program concepts and existing program extensions and innovations. We then concentrate our efforts on areas of greatest interest to our members. Our research and development process benefits from insight derived through our research programs and the involvement of industry thought leaders from progressive and well-known organizations that act as advisors, as well as from information we gather from hundreds of member interviews. We currently plan to continue introducing new programs and existing program extensions and innovations through a mixture of internal development activities, partnerships, and acquisitions.


• | Use differentiated data and expertise to provide comprehensive solutions to members. As the health care and education industries continue their transformation, our members are increasingly looking to consolidate and replace their individual vendors and products with strategic partners, integrated technology platforms, and comprehensive solutions. We believe many of our members will consider us particularly well suited to respond to this demand based on our unique research and best-practice insights, differentiated data acquisition and standardization capabilities, compiled data sets across thousands of physicians, patients, and students, and reputation for deep industry expertise and a strategic approach to solving issues.

We forge and find the best new ideas and proven practices from across our vast network of leaders. Then we customize and hardwire them into every level of our member organizations, creating enduring value. Through our membership model, we collaborate with executives and their teams to find and implement the best solutions to their toughest challenges. Our research programs offer proven, actionable insights inspired by the industry’s most progressive organizations. Our technology programs offer analytics platforms that surface opportunities, hardwire best practices, and accelerate progress. Our data-enabled services leverage our expertise to deliver value on behalf of our members. Our consulting services offer seasoned experts for strategic, customized support. 
Health Care
Our health care offerings are presented to the marketplace collectively as Advisory Board (www.advisory.com). We launched our first health care research program in 1986, and have built our market leadership position by providing best practice research and insight to health care leaders. We expanded into the delivery of distinct consulting capabilities in 2001, and serviced 400 organizations throughout 2016 with our staff of experts. In 2004, we launched our first technology program and serve 3,000 hospitals today. Through our research, we cover all areas of health care performance, providing best practice insights to the industry’s most pressing issues. Through our technology and consulting we solve specific business problems by applying best practices to create deep analytics, technology, and service solutions that enable the action members need to take.
Best Practices Research Programs
Best practice insight is the core of our business. Through our membership model, we offer our member organizations a direct line to the industry’s most-needed insights and best-practice ideas to help address their most important problems and find and implement the best solutions to their toughest challenges. We have deep relationships with senior-most leaders and an understanding of the key industry topics that will keep them up at night, and we dive into the root causes of key issues and find practices that have been demonstrated to have an impact.
Each of our best practices research programs is targeted at a specific member executive and addresses the executive’s specific strategic challenges, operational issues, and management concerns. Each program includes published studies, executive education, proprietary databases and online services, access to experts, and executive briefings, among other services, as we continue to enhance the programs with innovative features. For each best practices research program, we typically publish two to four best practices research studies annually. We design each study to present the conclusions and supporting best practices in a graphical format, enabling the intended audience to assimilate quickly the 100 to 250 pages of research content. Consistent application of our research methodology and extensive staff member training across all programs enable us to maintain a high level of research quality in the programs.
In addition to our research studies, we deliver an executive education curriculum based on our proprietary research to member institutions nationwide through four channels: general membership meetings; presentations conducted on-site at member organizations; on-call access to experts; and frequent teleconferences. In all four settings, we use interactive discussions to provide a deeper understanding and facilitate practical application of the best practices we have identified. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we delivered executive education services to more than 150,000 executive and managerial participants through more than 130 member meetings, over 2,300 on-site seminars, and approximately 250 webconferences. These interactions serve as an important building block for our relationships with members, allowing us the opportunity to gather input about our research agendas and services, generate leads for cross-selling additional programs to existing members, and identify ideas for potential new programs.
Across our research programs, we also offer a variety of online databases, content, tools, and calculators to increase the utility of our research, facilitate analysis of an organization’s current performance, and assist the adoption of best practices at member institutions. Each research program has a dedicated section on our password-protected member website, accessible only to members of the program, which includes such items as best practices, executive modules, online data, audit toolkits, and market forecasting instruments. Through the website, members of each program may search and access program-specific content, which includes the ability to access an electronic library of past and current research studies, review executive education modules, view meeting schedules, and communicate with our staff and other members. A few examples of our 18 research programs include:

• | Health Care Advisory Board: Through the Advisory Board's flagship research program, we provide CEOs and their executive teams strategic guidance, tools, and implementation support needed to win market share, protect margins, and drive population health return on investment.

• | Clinical Roundtables: We provide tools and benchmarks, best practices from health system peers, and expert insight to help our members strategically address specific service-line challenges in areas such as cardiovascular and oncology, as well as physician practices alignment and performance improvement.


• | Nursing Executive Center: We arm nurse executives with market insights and guidance to help set strategy, and provide support with the best practices and tools to help them achieve their top goals.


• | Post-Acute Care Collaborative: We provide best practice research and supporting tools to help our members navigate delivery system and payment reform challenges while helping to strengthen their acute and post-acute relationships and care quality.

We typically charge a separate annual membership fee for each program that is fixed for the duration of the membership agreement and entitles participating members to access all of a program’s membership services. Most programs are sold as recurring, multi-year contracts. Institutions may access our services within a program only if they are members of that program.
Technology Programs
We offer technology analytics programs anchored by cloud-based software applications that surface performance improvement opportunities to accelerate progress. These applications are regularly updated with member-specific data as well as third-party and proprietary data, and provide all member institutions with access to specific performance improvement metrics. The software applications pull data from disparate legacy information systems through standardized data extracts and, with analytics and proprietary metrics informed by our best practices research and insights, transform hard-to-access legacy data into performance reports and benchmarks offering actionable insight for managers and executives.
The technology programs are renewable and address perennial problems in areas in which we have developed significant knowledge through our research programs. Our programs are cloud-based, allowing members to derive value with minimal upfront investment costs. Cloud-based software allows continual access via the Internet and can quickly be updated, delivering new program content and functionality to all members with minimal disruption. The programs are built to be flexible and easy to use, offering members ad hoc querying, performance alerts, drill-down analysis, and comparative benchmarking.
Through the combination of our research and access to the technology programs, members gain insight into areas of opportunity for operational or financial improvement, receive best practices toolkits to capture the improvement, and directly use our resources to inform front-line decisions on an hourly, daily, and weekly basis. Our programs allow members to transform their data into information they can use to enhance performance, enabling them to quantify areas of opportunity and identify value captured through use of our programs, and allow members to benchmark themselves against each other and learn how other members captured value from our software applications and consulting services.
We offer 19 technology programs and enhanced solutions, a few of which include: 

• | Planning 20/20 is a recently redesigned planning solution that integrates Crimson Market Advantage with several key research assets, enhanced analytics, and business development guidance to support hospital strategic planners’ need to meet new and evolving industry demands across the continuum of care.


• | Crimson Continuum of Care helps hospitals achieve physician alignment, identify outliers in care delivery, and measure and sustain outcomes from unwarranted care variation reduction initiatives in order to advance quality goals and secure cost savings.


• | Integrated Revenue Cycle Management Platform spans the revenue lifecycle from patient access to mid-cycle to business office and contract/payer management, delivering workflow, analytics, and data-enabled automation that enables health systems to dramatically improve revenue capture, eliminate re-work, and optimize reimbursement. 

Consulting Services
Through our consulting services, we provide on-the-ground support for major performance improvement initiatives, as well as best practice professional management of key areas of the hospital or medical group. We assist in three primary ways: expert counsel, including business planning and strategy development; dedicated support, including interim senior management to oversee a specific change management process for a defined period; and long-term management, involving a seasoned group of senior executives working on-site for an extended period to provide hands-on, practical advice and execution against financial and operational goals.

Our consulting engagements deliver meaningful insights and results in areas such as strategy, electronic medical record (EMR) optimization, revenue cycle optimization, clinical quality and care redesign, physician practice management, operational capacity and workforce efficiency, supply cost savings, and development of accountable care organizations and clinically integrated networks. Our members benefit from outcome-focused consultants experienced in change management, access to best practice performance criteria, industry standard and proprietary benchmarks, implementation-oriented recommendations, and an objective third-party perspective.
Focus Areas
Our technology and consulting programs cover our members’ most important problem areas, and are organized into three areas of focus:

• | Driving Health System Growth: Driving the acquisition and retention of patients by assembling the network needed to effectively bring care in the right setting


• | Reducing Care Variation: Improving care quality and reducing cost by eliminating unwarranted care variation


• | Optimizing the Revenue Cycle: Ensuring members’ financial viability by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of revenue management

In each area we have multiple technology solutions and industry experts focused on delivering significant value to our health care members. In 2016, we were able to document over $2 billion in incremental savings, efficiency, and revenue capture for our members through their work with us. In addition, we have, and continue to innovate and develop, enterprise capabilities that integrate across all areas of our members operations.
Education
Our education offerings were launched in 2007 and are presented to the marketplace collectively as EAB (www.eab.com). In fiscal year 2016, we worked with more than 1,100 college and university members, conducted approximately 5,000 research interviews, maintained more than 450 million course records in our student success analytic models, and engaged in more than 1.2 billion student interactions. 
As in our health care business, our education offerings are all based on best practice. They are delivered through three types of renewable subscription programs: research, technology, and data-enabled services.
Research Programs
We offer more than a dozen research programs aimed at helping today's education leaders solve their most pressing issues and biggest problems. We identify best practices to address education’s top challenges with research forums dedicated to all key leaders of the academy, including provosts, chief business officers, chief information officers, chief research officers, vice presidents of enrollment management, vice presidents of student affairs, deans of continuing and online education, and many other key academic and administrative leaders. Across our research programs, we complete 50 major research initiatives each year. These best practices are disseminated to our membership through 100-250 page graphically-oriented publications, online publications and tools on our password protected member websites, and executive education presentations. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we delivered executive education services to more than 15,000 executive and managerial participants through more than 90 member meetings, over 390 on-site seminars, and over 100 webconferences. 
Our research programs provide us deep access to our member colleges and universities, strong relationships with their leaders, and an unparalleled view of the key problems they face. This set of insights not only fuels our best practice work through our research programs but also provides a continuous source for new business ideas, which we have continually capitalized on throughout our decade of serving education institutions. These best practice insights have seeded not only additional research programs but also programs where we hardwire them through technology and data-enabled services.
Technology Programs
Currently, our technology programs are primarily focused in the area of student success. With disappointing graduation rates and student retention an increasing problem on college campuses, colleges and universities are spending an estimated $3.2 billion on student success. In 2009, we published a study in our research program for vice presidents of academic affairs that identified sixteen best practices for student retention and timely graduation. Out of that work, we have developed a membership that combines analytics, interaction, and workflow technology to help our members support, retain, and graduate more students. With more than 450 million course records in the platform and over 3.6 million daily logins, our student success technology is used to improve student advising and increase student success by identifying and positively influencing choices by at-risk and off-path students.
7

In addition, we also partner with university academic and business leaders to leverage department-specific benchmarks in enrollment, capacity, outcomes, and costs to help make smart decisions and investments to improve academic efficiency and grow program revenues.
Data-enabled services
Currently, our data-enabled services are primarily focused in the area of enrollment management. With slowing demographic trends and declines in public funding, colleges and universities are spending an estimated $4.1 billion on enrollment management. Through data-driven solutions, we support colleges and universities in targeting qualified prospective students; building relationships with prospective students during the search, application, and yield process; and optimizing financial aid resources. Our differentiated capabilities are bolstered by our more than 1.2 billion student interactions, contact with virtually all U.S. college-bound students, and proprietary methodologies and marketing campaign testing.
Our Membership
As of the date of this report, our membership consisted of approximately 5,600 members, composed primarily of hospitals and health systems and colleges and universities, as well as selected other health care and education institutions. 
We seek to involve the country’s most progressive health care and education organizations in our membership. The participation of these members provides us with a window into the latest challenges confronting the industries we serve and the most innovative best practices that we can share broadly throughout our membership. As of December 31, 2016, we served all 20 of the honor roll hospitals listed in the 2016-2017 U.S. News and World Report ranking, all of the Becker Hospital Review largest 15 health systems in the United States, 30 of the world’s largest pharmaceutical and medical device companies, and 91 of the U.S. News and World Report top 100 national universities for 2017.
Our programs serve a range of constituencies, including both the most senior executives and the broader management team. As of the date of this report, our programs reached over 10,000 chief executive and chief operating officers and over 200,000 other senior executives, clinical leaders, department heads, and product-line managers. No one member accounted for more than 1.5% of our revenue in fiscal year 2016, fiscal year 2015, or the 2014 transition period. We generated approximately 2%, 2%, and 4% of our revenue from members outside the United States in fiscal year 2016, fiscal year 2015, and the 2014 transition period, respectively.
Pricing and Contracts
We typically charge a separate fixed annual membership fee for each of our programs that covers all of the services in the program. Annual fees vary by program based on the target executive constituency and the specific combination of services we provide to participating members. The annual fees paid by members within the same program also vary based on the size of the member institution and the total number of program memberships the member purchases. Membership fees also may be lower for the initial members of new programs. Annual fees for software programs are higher than annual fees for research and insights programs. On average, we increase membership fees 2% to 3% per year, and, in some of our programs, charge our members for certain direct billable expenses, such as travel expenses. Most of our memberships are multi-year agreements. Fees for our programs are generally payable in advance. 
Sales and Marketing
We maintain new business development teams that are responsible for selling new memberships and member services teams that are responsible for servicing and renewing existing memberships. New business development representatives typically focus on selling specific programs through face-to-face meetings with senior executives at current and prospective member institutions. Member services representatives assume a relationship management role and perform most of their responsibilities over the telephone. New business development teams and member services teams are compensated with base salaries and variable, goal-based incentives. For many of our members, we assign an executive advisor to ensure that the member is receiving value from the programs in which it currently participates, to identify new programs that could assist the member with key challenges that it faces, and to coordinate the activities of the new business development and member services teams with the goal of serving the member and expanding the overall member relationship.
Intellectual Property
We offer our members a range of products to which we claim intellectual property rights, including research content, online services, databases, electronic tools, cloud-based applications, performance metrics, and software products. We own and control a variety of trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights that, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. We are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others, and license other companies to use certain technology and other intellectual property that we control. We consider our trademarks, service marks, databases, software, and other intellectual 
8

property to be proprietary, and rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, non-disclosure, and contractual safeguards to protect our intellectual property rights. We have been granted federal registration for some of our trademarks and service marks.
Competition
We are not aware of any other organization that offers services to health care or education organizations across as broad a range of best practices, technology and data-enabled services, and consulting services as those offered by our company. We compete in some discrete programs and for discretionary expenditures against health care-focused, education-focused, and multi-industry firms. These include consulting and strategy firms; market research, data, benchmarking, and forecasting providers; technology vendors and services firms; health care information technology firms; technology advisory firms; outsourcing firms; and specialized providers of educational and training services. Other organizations, such as state and national trade associations, group purchasing organizations, non-profit think-tanks, and database companies, also may offer research, consulting, tools, and education services to health care and education organizations.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include quality and timeliness of research and analysis; applicability and efficacy of recommendations; strength and depth of relationships with member senior executives; reliability and effectiveness of software applications; distinctiveness of dashboards and user interfaces; depth and quality of the customer network; ability to meet the changing needs of current and prospective members; measurable returns on customer investment; and service and affordability. We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. 
Our collaboration agreement with CEB, a global business membership and research organization, to enhance our services to members and explore new product development opportunities expired in February 2017. The collaboration agreement includes a limited non-competition provision that survives the expiration until February 2018 in accordance with its terms.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we are subject to ordinary routine litigation incidental to our normal business operations. We are not currently a party to, and our property is not subject to, any material legal proceedings.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 3,800 professionals, approximately 2,000 of whom are based in our headquarters in Washington, D.C. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining arrangement. 
Government Regulation
The health care and education industries are highly regulated and subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences. Existing and new federal and state laws and regulations affecting the health care and education industries could create unexpected liabilities for us, could cause us or our members to incur additional costs and could restrict our or our members’ operations. Many of the laws are complex and their application to us, our members, or the specific services and relationships we have with our members are not always clear. 
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act, was signed into law with the stated goal of expanding access to affordable health insurance, controlling health care costs, and improving health care quality. 
Based on public statements made by President Trump and members of Congress, it is possible that legislation may be enacted that would materially affect the Affordable Care Act and its implementation, including legislation that would repeal, replace, amend, or defund the law. We cannot predict the impact a repeal or substantial revision of the Affordable Care Act may have on our business or the business of our members.
Our failure to anticipate accurately the application of the laws and regulations affecting the health care and education industries, or our other failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and otherwise negatively affect our business. See the “Risk Factors” section of this report for more information about the impact of government regulation on our company.
