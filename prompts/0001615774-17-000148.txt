ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
Origo Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”, “we”, “our” and “us”) is a blank check company formed on August 26, 2014 under the name CB Pharma Acquisition Corp. for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. The Company’s efforts in identifying a prospective target business is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region of the world.
 
On December 17, 2014, we closed our initial public offering (the “IPO” or “initial public offering”) of 4,000,000 units (“Unit”), with each unit consisting of one ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share (“Ordinary Share”), one right (“Right”) to receive one-tenth of one Ordinary Share upon consummation of an initial business combination (a “business combination”) and one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”) entitling the holder to purchase one-half of one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per full share commencing on our completion of a business combination. Simultaneous with the consummation of the initial public offering, we consummated the private placement of 285,000 private Units (“Private Placement Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating total proceeds of $2,850,000. Of the Private Placement Units, 265,000 were purchased by Fortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress”), formerly known as Coronado Biosciences, Inc., an affiliate of the Company’s former executive officers and the original holder of a majority of the Company’s ordinary shares prior to the IPO, and 20,000 were purchased by EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (“EBC”), the representative of the underwriters in the IPO.
 
On December 24, 2014, we consummated the sale of an additional 200,000 Units upon the partial exercise of the over-allotment option (the “Over-Allotment”). The Units from the IPO (including the Over-Allotment) were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $42,000,000. In a private sale that took place simultaneously with the consummation of the exercise of the Over-Allotment, EBC purchased an additional 1,000 Private Placement Units at $10.00 per unit for a total consideration of $10,000. An aggregate amount of approximately $42.85 million (approximately $10.20 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO, the Over-Allotment, and the Private Placement Units, net of fees of approximately $1.84 million associated with the Initial Public Offering, inclusive of approximately $1.37 million of underwriting fees, was placed in a trust account (“trust account”) immediately after the sales and invested in U.S. government treasury bills.
 
Prior to our IPO, our original initial shareholders purchased an aggregate of 1,050,000 initial shares (the “Initial Shares”) from us for an aggregate of $25,000.  
 
On May 20, 2016, we entered into an agreement (the “Transfer Agreement”) with the holders of the initial shares (the holders of the initial shares (including the transferees described herein) being referred to as the “initial shareholders”) and each of EJF Opportunities, LLC, Stephen B. Pudles, Jose M. Aldeanueva, Jeffrey J. Gutovich Profit Sharing Plan and Barry Rodgers (collectively being referred to as the “investors”) pursuant to which the initial shareholders transferred to the investors the 1,050,000 initial shares held by them. Our former directors also (i) appointed Edward J. Fred, Jose M. Aldeanueva, Stephen B. Pudles, Jeffrey J. Gutovich and Barry Rodgers as members of our board of directors and Messrs. Fred and Aldeanueva as Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary of the Company, respectively (such new officers and directors collectively referred to herein as the “Current Management”), and (ii) tendered their resignations to be effective upon approval of the Initial Extension (as defined below) in June 2016.
 
On June 10, 2016, we held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “June Meeting”). At the June Meeting, the shareholders approved each of the following items: (i) the extension of the date by which we had to consummate a business combination from June 12, 2016 to December 12, 2016 (the “Initial Extension”), (ii) an amendment to the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the “charter”) to allow the holders of public shares (the “Public Shareholders”) to elect to convert their public shares (the “public shares”) into their pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, and (iii) to change the Company’s name from “CB Pharma Acquisition Corp.” to “Origo Acquisition Corporation” (the “Name Change”). Under Cayman Islands law, the amendments to the charter took effect upon their approval.
 
At the June Meeting, shareholders holding 1,054,401 public shares exercised their right to convert such public shares into a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account. As a result, approximately $10.76 million (or approximately $10.20 per share) was removed from the trust account to pay such holders. In connection with the Initial Extension, our Current Management provided a loan to us of $0.20 for each public share that was not converted, for an aggregate amount of approximately $629,000, which was deposited this in the trust account. In addition to the contribution, the Current Management (the “Lender”) loaned to us an additional amount of approximately $371,000 for our working capital needs, for an aggregate amount of $1,000,000. The loan was evidenced by a promissory note (the “Note”) and was unsecured, non-interest bearing and is payable at our consummation of a business combination. As issued, the Note did not bear interest, and up to $175,000 of the principal amount of the Note is convertible at the option of the Lender into 17,500 private placement units (consisting of one ordinary share, one right and one warrant for one-half of an ordinary share) at $10.00 per unit. The terms of the units are identical to the units issued by us in our initial public offering except that the warrants included in such units are non-redeemable by us and will be exercisable for cash or on a “cashless” basis, in each case, if held by the initial holders or their permitted transferees. If the Current Management converts the entire $175,000 of the principal balance of the Note, they would receive 17,500 private placement units. If a business combination is not consummated, the Note will not be repaid by us and all amounts owed thereunder by us will be forgiven except to the extent that we have funds available outside of the trust account.
 
On December 12, 2016, we held an annual meeting of shareholders (the “December Meeting”). At the December Meeting, the shareholders approved each of the following items: (i) an amendment to the charter to extend the date by which we must consummate a business combination from December 12, 2016 to March 12, 2017 (the “Second Extension”), (ii) the election of Barry Rodgers as a Class A director, to serve until the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders or until his successor is elected and qualified, and (iii) to direct the ratification of the selection by our audit committee of Marcum LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending November 30, 2016. Under Cayman Islands law, the amendments to the charter took effect upon their approval.
 
At the December Meeting, shareholders holding 36,594 public shares exercised their right to convert such public shares into a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account. As a result, $380,580 (or approximately $10.40 per share) was removed from the trust account to pay such holders. In connection with the Second Extension, the Current Management provided a loan to us for an aggregate amount of $320,000, of which approximately $310,900, or $0.10 for each public share that was not converted, was deposited in the trust account. In exchange for the additional funding, we and the Lender entered into an amendment to the Note pursuant to which: (i) the principal amount of the Note was increased by $320,000, and (ii) the Note will accrue interest, retroactively from its date of issuance in June 2016, at a rate of 5.5% per annum up to a maximum of $32,335 in interest, which interest will be payable on the due date for payment of the principal of the Note.

Recent Developments
 
On December 19, 2016, we entered into a Merger Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with Aina Le’a Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Aina Le’a”), Aina Le’a Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aina Le’a (“Merger Sub”), and Jose Aldeanueva, in the capacity as the representative for the stockholders of the Company and their successors and assign (the “OAC Representative”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”), we will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity (the “Merger”). As a result of the consummation of the Merger, we will cease to exist and the holders of the Company’s equity securities and warrants, options and rights to acquire or convert into the Company’s equity securities will convert into Aina Le’a equity securities and warrants, options and rights to acquire or convert into Aina Le’a equity securities. The description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement which was filed with the SEC on December 23, 2016 on Form 8-K.  You are urged to read the entire Merger Agreement and the other exhibits attached thereto.  Our board of directors has approved the Merger Agreement. Unless specifically stated, this Annual Report does not give effect to the Merger and does not contain the risks associated with the Merger. Such risks and effects relating to the Merger will be included in our preliminary proxy statement and definitive proxy statement to be filed with the SEC. 
Competitive Advantages
 
We believe our competitive strengths to be the following:
 
Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business may exchange their shares in the target business for our shares or for a combination of shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses might find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that will likely not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. Furthermore, once the business combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests than it would have as a privately-held company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
With respect to the Merger, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, we will merge with and into the Merger Sub, with the Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity. As a result of the consummation of the Merger, we will cease to exist and the holders of our equity securities and warrants, options and rights to acquire or convert into our equity securities will convert into Aina Le’a equity securities and warrants, options and rights to acquire or convert into Aina Le’a equity securities.
 
While we believe that our status as a public company will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company as a deterrent and may prefer to effect a business combination with a more established entity or with a private company.
 
Financial Position
 
With funds held in trust available for our initial business combination in the amount of $32,657,327 as of December 31, 2016 ($32,728,640 as of November 30, 2016), we offer a target business a variety of options such as providing the owners of a target business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares, providing cash for stock, and providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to consummate our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires.
Effecting a Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in any substantive commercial business until we complete a business combination, including the Merger. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of Private Placement Units, our share capital, debt or a combination of these, as well as the contributions made by our Current Management in connection with the June Meeting and December Meeting, in effecting a business combination. Although substantially all of the net proceeds of the initial public offering and the private placement of Private Placement Units are intended to be applied generally toward effecting a business combination, which may include the Merger, the proceeds are not otherwise being designated for any more specific purposes. A business combination (if not Aina Le’a pursuant to the Merger) may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various Federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.

Sources of Target Businesses
 
Target business candidates have and may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. These sources have and may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this prospectus and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their respective affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. To the extent we engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we have and may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will any of our existing officers, directors, special advisors or initial shareholders, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of a business combination (regardless of the type of transaction). If we decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our officers, directors or initial shareholders, we will do so only if we have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view.
 
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
 
Subject to the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. We have not established any other specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:
 

· | financial condition and results of operation;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | growth potential;
--+------------------


· | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | capital requirements;
--+----------------------


· | competitive position;
--+----------------------


· | barriers to entry;
--+-------------------


· | stage of development of its products, processes or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | proprietary features and degree of intellectual property or other protection for its products, processes or services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | costs associated with effecting the business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 
3


We believe such factors will be important in evaluating prospective target businesses, regardless of the location or industry in which such target business operates. However, this list is not intended to be exhaustive. Furthermore, we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. A discussion of Aina Le’a will be included in our preliminary proxy statement and definitive proxy statement to be filed with the SEC.
 
Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.
 
Fair Market Value of Target Business
 
Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. A business combination can be structured where we acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure a business combination where we merge directly with the target business (such as the Merger). We can also structure a business combination where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, only the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold. We did not obtain such an opinion in connection with the Merger.

Business Combination Procedures
 
In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as described below, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account or sell any public shares to us in any tender offer in connection with a proposed business combination. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each public shareholder may tender any or all of his, her or its public shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction, whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer at such time (which would require us to conduct a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Unlike other blank check companies which require shareholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and related conversions of public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combination even when a vote is not required by law, we will have the flexibility to avoid such shareholder vote and allow our shareholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. For the Merger, we intend to seek shareholder approval of the Merger with Aina Le’a at a meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the Merger, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable).
 
We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. The $5,000,001 net tangible asset value would be determined once a target business is located and we can assess all of the assets and liabilities of the combined company (which would include the fee payable to EBC in an amount equal to 4.0% of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering as described elsewhere in this annual report, any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates in connection with certain activities on our behalf, such as identifying and investigating possible business targets and business combinations that have not been repaid at that time, as well as any other liabilities of ours and the liabilities of the target business). However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted or sold to us) and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. With respect to the Merger, as part of the closing conditions, we must (i) have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 after giving effect to any redemptions of public shareholders required by our organizational documents and our IPO prospectus (the “Closing Redemption Offer”), and (ii) after giving effect to the Closing Redemption Offer and deducting any unpaid transaction expenses, extension costs and deferred IPO offering costs, have cash and cash equivalents of at least $15,000,000. 
 
5


Our initial shareholders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any ordinary shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination.
 
Conversion/Tender Rights
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public shareholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Any such conversions will be effected under our charter, as amended, and Cayman Islands law as repurchases. A holder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek conversion of his shares.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to 30% or more of the ordinary shares sold in our initial public offering. Accordingly, all shares in excess of 30% of the shares sold in our initial public offering held by a holder will not be converted to cash. We believe this restriction will prevent shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares before the vote is held to approve a proposed business combination and attempt to use the conversion right as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then current market price. By limiting a shareholder’s ability to convert no more than 30% of the ordinary shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we have limited the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block a transaction which is favored by our other public shareholders.
 
Alternatively, if we engage in a tender offer, each public shareholder will be provided the opportunity to sell his public shares to us in such tender offer. The tender offer rules require us to hold the tender offer open for at least 20 business days. Accordingly, this is the minimum amount of time we would need to provide holders to determine whether they want to sell their public shares to us in the tender offer or remain an investor in our company.
 
Our initial shareholders will not have conversion rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to our initial public offering or purchased by them in our initial public offering or in the aftermarket. EBC will not have conversion rights with respect to the shares included in the Private Placement Units, or “private shares.”
 
We may also require public shareholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent at any time through the vote on the business combination or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. Once the shares are converted by the beneficial holder, and effectively repurchased by us under Cayman Island law, the transfer agent will then update our Register of Shareholders to reflect all conversions. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to shareholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a shareholder would have from the time the shareholder received our proxy statement through the vote on the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. Under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we are required to provide at least 10 days’ advance notice of any shareholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a shareholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights.
 
6


There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require shareholders seeking to exercise conversion rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to shareholders.
 
Any request to convert or tender such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion or tender and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination or the expiration of the tender offer not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their conversion or tender rights would not be entitled to convert or tender their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.
 
Automatic Liquidation of trust account if No Business Combination
 
If we do not complete a business combination by March 12, 2017, it will trigger our automatic winding up, dissolution and liquidation pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. As a result, this has the same effect as if we had formally gone through a voluntary liquidation procedure under the Companies Law. Accordingly, no vote would be required from our shareholders to commence such a voluntary winding up, dissolution and liquidation.
 
The amount in the trust account (less $315 representing the aggregate nominal par value of the shares of our public shareholders) under the Companies Law will be treated as share premium which is distributable under the Cayman Companies Law provided that immediately following the date on which the proposed distribution is proposed to be made, we are able to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. If we are forced to liquidate the trust account, we anticipate that we would distribute to our public shareholders the amount in the trust account calculated as of the date that is two days prior to the distribution date (including any accrued interest). Prior to such distribution, we would be required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us by our creditors for amounts they are actually owed and make provision for such amounts, as creditors take priority over our public shareholders with respect to amounts that are owed to them. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent of distributions received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an insolvent liquidation. Furthermore, while we will seek to have all vendors and service providers (which would include any third parties we engaged to assist us in any way in connection with our search for a target business) and prospective target businesses execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account or that a court would conclude that such agreements are legally enforceable.
 
7


Each of our initial shareholders has agreed to waive its rights to participate in any liquidation of our trust account or other assets with respect to the insider shares and private shares and to vote their insider shares and private shares in favor of any dissolution and liquidation proposal which we submit to a vote of shareholders. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants and rights, which will expire worthless.
 
If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share distribution from the trust account would be approximately $10.50.
 
The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would be prior to the claims of our public shareholders. Although we will seek to have all vendors, including lenders for money borrowed, prospective target businesses or other entities we engage execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refused to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, we would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to us if we chose not to engage such third party and evaluate if such engagement would be in the best interest of our shareholders if such third party refused to waive such claims. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. In any event, our management would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and would only enter into an agreement with a third party that did not execute a waiver if management believed that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason.
 
Fortress had agreed that, if we liquidate the trust account prior to the consummation of a business combination, it will be liable to pay debts and obligations to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us in excess of the net proceeds of our initial public offering not held in the trust account, but only to the extent necessary to ensure that such debts or obligations do not reduce the amounts in the trust account and only if such parties have not executed a waiver agreement. As part of the resignations and appointment of the Current Management (as described elsewhere in this Annual Report), Mr. Fred, our Chief Executive Officer, agreed to be responsible for such obligations and Fortress has been released from such obligations. However, we cannot assure you that Mr. Fred will be able to satisfy those obligations if he is required to do so. Accordingly, the actual per-share distribution could be less than $10.50, plus interest, due to claims of creditors. Additionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public shareholders at least $10.50 per share.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.

The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

· | our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or obtain the necessary financial information to be sent to shareholders in connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the completion of a transaction;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our obligation to convert ordinary shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Nasdaq may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a business combination;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our outstanding rights, warrants and unit purchase options, and the potential future dilution they represent;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our obligation to pay EBC a fee of 4.0% of the gross proceeds of the IPO upon consummation of our initial business combination
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our obligation to either repay or issue Private Placement Units upon conversion of up to $500,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our initial shareholders and current or former officers, directors or their affiliates;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the Private Placement Units (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, including the Merger, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, including the Merger, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Employees
 
We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once management locates a suitable target business to acquire, they will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time to our affairs) than they would prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect each of our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
