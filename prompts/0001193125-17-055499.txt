ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
GENERAL 
 Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. is a corporation organized under the laws of Canada. As used in this document, the term PCS refers to Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. and, unless the context requires otherwise, the terms we, us, our, PotashCorp and the Company refer to PCS and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, individually or in any combination, as applicable. The Company is a foreign private issuer under the rules and regulations of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC); however, it currently files voluntarily on the SECs domestic forms. 
 We are the worlds largest fertilizer producer by capacity producing the three primary crop nutrients: potash, nitrogen and phosphate. We are the largest producer of potash worldwide by capacity. In 2016, we estimate our potash operations represented 22% of global potash capacity1, our nitrogen operations represented 2% of global nitrogen capacity and our phosphate operations represented 3% of global phosphate capacity. 
 At December 31, 2016, we owned and operated five potash operations in Saskatchewan and owned one in New Brunswick. In November 2015, we permanently closed our Penobsquis mine in New Brunswick and in January 2016 we indefinitely suspended our Picadilly, New Brunswick potash operations. Our Picadilly operations are being kept in care-and-maintenance mode. 
 Our nitrogen operations involve the production of nitrogen fertilizers and nitrogen feed and industrial products, including ammonia, urea, diesel emission fluid, nitrogen solutions, ammonium nitrate and nitric acid. We have nitrogen facilities in Georgia, Louisiana, Ohio and Trinidad. 
 Our phosphate operations include the manufacture and sale of solid and liquid phosphate fertilizers, phosphate feed and industrial acid, which is used in food products and industrial processes. We have phosphate mines and mineral processing plant complexes in Florida and North Carolina. We also have four phosphate feed plants in the United States and produce phosphoric acid at our Geismar, Louisiana facility. 
 Our principal executive offices are located at Suite 500, 122 1st Avenue South, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada S7K 7G3, and our telephone number is (306) 933-8500.
 History 
 PCS is a corporation continued under the Canada Business Corporations Act and is the successor to a corporation without share capital established by the Province of Saskatchewan in 1975. Between 1976 and 1989 substantial interests in the Saskatchewan potash industry were acquired. These acquisitions included the purchase of the Cory mine in 1976 and the Rocanville and Lanigan mines in 1977. 
 In 1989, the Province of Saskatchewan privatized PCS. While the Province initially retained an ownership interest in PCS, this interest was reduced to zero by the end of 1993. Since the privatization of PCS, we have made the following significant acquisitions: 
 

 | the Allan mine, through the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Saskterra Fertilizers Ltd. in 1990;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the Penobsquis New Brunswick potash mine, which we permanently closed in November 2015, and our Patience Lake solution mine in Saskatchewan in 1993;

 Merger of Equals with Agrium 
 During the third quarter of 2016, the Company entered into an arrangement agreement (the Arrangement Agreement) with Agrium pursuant to which the Company and Agrium have agreed to combine their businesses (the Proposed Transaction) in a merger of equals transaction to be implemented by way of a statutory arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act. Upon the closing of the Proposed Transaction, the Company and Agrium will become indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries of a new parent company (New Parent). PotashCorp shareholders will own approximately 52 percent of New Parent, and Agrium shareholders will own approximately 48 percent of New Parent. The Proposed Transaction is currently anticipated to be completed in mid-2017 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. 
  POTASH OPERATIONS 
 Our potash operations include the mining and processing of potash, which is predominantly used as fertilizer. 
 Properties 
 The following map shows the location of our Canadian mining facilities during 2016. 
 



All potash produced by the Company in Saskatchewan is in the southern half of the Province, where extensive potash deposits, or Members, are found. The potash ore is contained in a predominantly rock salt formation known as the Prairie Evaporite, which lies about 1,000 metres below the surface. The evaporite 

  deposits, which are bounded by limestone formations, contain potash beds of approximately 2.4 to 5.1 metres of thickness. Three potash deposits of economic importance occur in the Province: the Esterhazy, Belle Plaine and Patience Lake Members. The Patience Lake Member is mined at the Lanigan, Allan, Patience Lake and Cory mines, and the Esterhazy Member is mined at the Rocanville mine. 
 We have the right to mine 923,644 acres of land in Saskatchewan. Included in these holdings are mineral rights to 816,933 acres contained in blocks around our potash mines, of which approximately 25% are owned by us, approximately 58% are under lease from the Province of Saskatchewan and approximately 17% are leased from other parties. Our remaining 106,711 acres are located elsewhere in Saskatchewan. 
 Our leases with the Province of Saskatchewan are for 21-year terms, renewable at our option. Our significant leases with other parties are also for 21-year terms. Such other leases are renewable at our option, providing generally that production is continuing and that there is continuation of the applicable lease with the Province of Saskatchewan. 
 In November 2015, in response to a weaker fertilizer environment, we accelerated and completed the permanent closure of our Penobsquis facility in New Brunswick. In January 2016, in light of challenging market conditions, we indefinitely suspended potash operations at our Picadilly facility in New Brunswick. We are keeping idled capacity at Picadilly in a care-and-maintenance mode, which retains the optionality to resume operations as market conditions warrant. We believe that any resumption of operations at our Picadilly facility would take at least one year. 
 In New Brunswick, we mined pursuant to a mining lease with the Province of New Brunswick. The lease is for a term of 21 years from 1978 with renewal provisions for three additional 21 year periods. This lease was renewed effective June 13, 1999 and amended in 2005 to add additional land. We have the right to mine 58,263 acres of land in New Brunswick. This right is not materially affected by the indefinite suspension of our New Brunswick potash operations. We also hold an interest in certain oil and gas rights in the vicinity of the Picadilly facility. 
 Production 
 We produce potash using both conventional and solution mining methods. In conventional operations, shafts are sunk to the ore body and mining machines cut out the ore, which is lifted to the surface for processing. In solution mining, the potash is dissolved in warm brine and pumped to the surface for processing. Eleven grades of potash are produced to suit different preferences of the various markets we serve. 
 In 2016, our conventional potash operations mined 26.95 million tonnes of ore at an average mineral grade of 22.96% potassium oxide (K2O). In 2016, our potash production from all our 




4 | PotashCorp 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K

 
  operations consisted of 8.60 million tonnes of potash (KCl or finished product) with an average grade of 60.97% K2O, representing 47% of North American production. 
 In 2016, our nameplate capacity represented an estimated 51% of the North American total capacity (based on our nameplate capacity, see table below for further information). We allocate production among our mines on the basis of various factors, including cost efficiency and the grades of product that can be produced. The Patience Lake mine, which was originally 

  a conventional underground mine, began employing a solution mining method in 1989. The other Saskatchewan mines we own employ conventional underground mining methods. 
 Our New Brunswick operations also produced approximately 329,000 tonnes of sodium chloride (salt) in 2016. Despite the suspension of our New Brunswick potash operations, we expect to continue to mine salt for the local market at this time, albeit at a reduced rate. 



The following table sets forth, for each of the past three years, the production of ore, grade and finished product for each of our mines.

 The mining of potash is a capital-intensive business subject to the normal risks and capital expenditure requirements associated with mining operations. The processing of ore may be subject to delays and costs resulting from mechanical failures and hazards, including unusual or unexpected geological conditions, subsidence, water inflows, and other conditions involved in mining ore. For more information, see Risk Factors  Certain complications may arise in our mining process, including water inflows in our potash mines. on page 21 in Item 1A of Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Reserves 
 The Companys estimates for its conventional mining operations in Saskatchewan are based on exploration drill hole data, seismic 

  data and actual mining results during the past 46 to 48 years. In Saskatchewan reserves are estimated by identifying material in place that is delineated on at least two sides and material in place within one mile from an existing sampled mine entry or borehole. 
 The Companys estimates for its conventional mining operations in New Brunswick are based on exploration drill hole data, seismic data and actual mining results during the past 33 years. In New Brunswick, reserves are estimated by identifying material in place that is delineated by drilling or mining with results projected conservatively from these intersections. As of January 2016, the Companys New Brunswick operations no longer produce potash. Reserves remain at our Picadilly, New Brunswick facility, which is in care and maintenance mode, whereas reserves at the Penobsquis 




PotashCorp 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 5

 
  mine have been reduced to zero as a result of its permanent closure. It would take at least a year to restart operations at our Picadilly, New Brunswick facility. 
 Generally, we distinguish between proven and probable reserves in respect of our potash operations based on the level of certainty and established continuity of the mineralization in the potash 
 deposits and reserves described. For our Saskatchewan potash operations, we distinguish proven reserves from probable reserves based on greater delineation of the reserve, which is estimated 

  through drilling and mine entry sampling. For our New Brunswick potash operations, we distinguished proven reserves from probable reserves based on the extent of exploration coverage. 
 A historical extraction ratio from the 46 to 48 years of mining results is applied to estimate the mineable reserves. The Companys estimated recoverable ore (reserve tonnage only) as of December 31, 2016 for each of our potash mines is as follows:

(1) | There has been no third-party review of reserve estimates within the last three years.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | The extraction ratio of recoverable ore to in-place material for each mine is as follows: Allan 0.33, Cory 0.27, Lanigan 0.26 and Rocanville 0.31.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | The concentration of recoverable ore tonnes to finished product (KCl) for each of the divisions is as follows (three-year running average): Allan 2.8, Cory 3.5, Lanigan 3.3 and Rocanville 3.2.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | From in-mine samples, New Brunswick values are from explorative drill holes. .
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | While the term potash refers to a wide variety of potassium-bearing minerals, at our deposits the predominant potash mineralization is sylvinite, which is comprised mainly of the minerals sylvite (KCl/potassium salt) and halite (NaCl/rock salt) with minor amounts of carnallite (KClMgCl26 H2O) and water insolubles. Potash fertilizer is concentrated, nearly pure KCl (i.e. with a purity greater than 95%), but ore-grade is traditionally reported on a % K2O basis. The % K2O equivalent gives a standard measurement of the nutrient value of different potassium-bearing rocks and minerals. To convert from K2O equivalent tonnes to actual KCl tonnes, multiply by 1.583.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(6) | Estimates are based upon proven and probable reserves and average annual mining rates (million tonnes of ore hoisted per year) equal to the three-year running average for each of the divisions as follows: Allan 6.9, Cory 4.6, Lanigan 6.2 and Rocanville 8.1. Mining rates are constrained by the equipment and manpower utilized at each mine so that our production capacity at each mine depends, in part, on the ore concentration encountered at each mine. Years of remaining mine life are based on applying the average annual mining rate to reported reserves. Years of remaining mine life for Lanigan is calculated based on the total reserves in the A Zone and the B Zone. For New Brunswick, estimates are not provided as Penobsquis operations were closed in November 2015, and in January 2016, the Picadilly potash operations were suspended indefinitely, with no three year running average for Picadilly available.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(7) | At each of the Allan, Cory and Lanigan operations, potash mineralization occurs in two separate horizons (A Zone and B Zone). To date, at Allan and Cory we have defined mineral reserves in only one zone (where most mining has occurred at that operation). At Allan and Cory the mineral reserves are in A Zone. At Lanigan, we have defined mineral reserves in both the A Zone and B Zone.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(8) | Given the characteristics of the solution mining method employed at the Patience Lake mine, it is not possible to estimate reliably the recoverable ore reserve from this operation. In solution mining, the potash is dissolved in warm brine and pumped to the surface for processing. Chemical compositions and volumes of brine pumped into and out of the underground mineralized zone are known, but the precise nature of the solution mining process is not. Estimates are made utilizing the surfaces available for dissolution in the abandoned mine workings, the concentration of the circulated brine recovered from the mine, annual crystallization rates in the ponds and the annual volume of KCl recovered from the ponds. The Patience Lake operation accounted for approximately 2.7% of the Companys potash production in 2016.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(9) | The Penobsquis, New Brunswick mine, permanently closed in November 2015. As of December 31, 2016, the Picadilly, New Brunswick facility had 159 million of tonnes of Proven Mineral Reserves. In January 2016, the Company indefinitely suspended its potash operation at Picadilly, which operations are being kept in care-and-maintenance mode. It would take at least one year to restart potash operations at the Picadilly facility.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resources 
 Mineral resources, which are exclusive of the mineral reserves reported above, are contained within the lands for which a mining lease is held at each mine. These resources are reported as mineralization in-place while the reserves are reported as recoverable ore. 
 In Saskatchewan, where geological correlations are straightforward, the mineral resource categories are generally characterized by the Company as follows: 
 

 | areas of detailed, physical exploration through actual drilling or mine sampling, near existing underground workings, and within
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


a mining lease are reported in the measured mineral resource category;
----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | areas of sparse exploration, such as areas with 3D surface seismic coverage, little or no drilling, and at some distance from underground workings, and within a mining lease are reported in the indicated mineral resource category; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | areas of limited exploration, such as areas that have been investigated through regional geological studies, or areas with 2D regional surface seismic coverage, little or no drilling, and at some distance from underground workings, and still within a mining lease or exploration permit area are reported in the inferred mineral resource category.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6 | PotashCorp 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K

 
 Exploration information used to infer and compute resource tonnage estimates for Saskatchewan consists of physical sampling (boreholes) and surface seismic data (3D and 2D). In New Brunswick, where geology is more complex, mineral resource categories are generally characterized by the Company as follows: 
 

 | areas with many drill hole intersections within a seismically defined area and with consistent stratigraphy, mineralogy and potash quality are reported in the measured mineral resource category;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | areas with few drill intersections within a seismically defined area, or with structurally modified (folded) and less consistent mineralogy, but still exhibiting good quality potash intersections, are reported in the indicated mineral resource category; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | areas with little or no drilling, complex geology, partial seismic coverage and/or inconsistent potash quality in drill intersections are reported in the inferred mineral resource category.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Exploration information used to infer and compute resource tonnage estimates in New Brunswick consists of physical sampling (boreholes and regional surface mapping), surface seismic data (3D and 2D), and airborne electromagnetic and regional gravity data. Although all of our New Brunswick operations are currently suspended, we have not closed our Picadilly mine. The Picadilly mine is in care-and-maintenance mode; and we estimate it would take at least a year to restart operations. 



The Companys estimated mineral resource tonnage as of December 31, 2016 for each of our mines is as follows:

 The scientific and technical information included in the Potash Operations section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been prepared by or under the supervision of persons who are qualified persons under Canadian National Instrument 43-101  Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101). In 2016, for our Saskatchewan and New Brunswick operations, Mark Fracchia (President, PCS Potash) was the qualified person who supervised the preparation of the information and who verified the data disclosed herein. 
 Data for the mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates for our Saskatchewan mines reported herein were verified by PotashCorp technical staff as follows: 
 

 | annual review of underground potash sample information (boreholes and in-mine ore samples);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | annual review of surface geophysical exploration results (3D and 2D seismic data);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | annual cross-checking of mined tonnages reported by minesite technical staff with tonnages estimated from mine survey information; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | annual cross-checking of reserve and resource computations carried out by technical staff.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This approach to data verification of potash mineral grade and surface seismic information is in accordance with generally accepted industry practice for areas adjacent and contiguous to an existing operating potash mine.

NITROGEN OPERATIONS 
 Our nitrogen operations include production of nitrogen fertilizers and nitrogen chemicals. These products are used for agricultural, industrial and animal nutrition purposes. 
 Properties 
 We have four nitrogen production facilities, of which three are located in the United States and one is located in Trinidad. The following table sets forth the facility locations and products produced. 

Plant Locations | Nitrogen Products Produced 
Augusta, GA | Ammonia, urea, nitric acid, ammonium nitrate and nitrogen solutions
Geismar, LA | Ammonia, nitric acid and nitrogen solutions 
Lima, OH | Ammonia, urea, nitric acid and nitrogen solutions 
Point Lisas, Trinidad | Ammonia and urea 

Production 
 Unlike potash and phosphate, nitrogen is not mined. It is synthesized from air using steam and natural gas or coal to produce ammonia. The ammonia is used to produce a full line of upgraded nitrogen products, including urea, nitrogen solutions, ammonium nitrate and nitric acid. Ammonia, urea and nitrogen solutions are sold as fertilizers to agricultural customers and to industrial customers for various applications. Nitric acid and ammonium nitrate are sold to industrial customers for various applications. Urea is also sold for feed applications. 
 The following table sets forth the annual capacity and, for each of the last three years, the Companys production of ammonia.

Raw Materials 
 Natural gas is the primary raw material used for the production of nearly all of our nitrogen products. In the United States, we may enter into natural gas hedging transactions with the goal of minimizing risk from volatile gas prices. In Trinidad, natural gas is purchased pursuant to a number of long-term contracts using pricing formulas related to the market price of ammonia. These contracts, which include minimum take or pay requirements, can provide the entire Trinidad ammonia complex with 95% of its expected requirements for 2017 and 2018. With the exception of the Trinidad facility, we purchase most of our natural gas from producers or marketers at the point of delivery of the natural gas into the pipeline system, then pay the pipeline company and, where applicable, the local distribution company to transport the natural gas to our nitrogen facilities. Approximately 84% of our US consumption of natural gas by our nitrogen operations is delivered pursuant to firm transportation contracts, which do not permit the pipeline or local distribution company to interrupt service to, or divert natural gas from, the plant. 
PHOSPHATE OPERATIONS 
 We mine phosphate ore and manufacture phosphoric acid, solid and liquid fertilizers, animal feed supplements, purified phosphoric acid, which is used in food products and industrial processes, and hydrofluosilicic acid (HFSA). 
Properties 
 We conduct our phosphate operations primarily at two facilities: a 75,212-acre facility near Aurora, North Carolina and a 99,588-acre facility near White Springs in northern Florida. The Aurora facility includes a 5.4 million tonne per-year mining operation, three sulfuric acid plants, four phosphoric acid plants, four purified acid plants, a liquid fertilizer plant, four superphosphoric acid (SPA) plants, a deflourinated merchant grade acid plant (DFMGA), a low magnesium SPA plant (LOMAG), a defluorinated phosphate (DFP) or animal feed plant, and two granulation plants capable of producing diammonium phosphate (DAP) or monoammonium phosphate (MAP). 
 The White Springs facility includes a mine, the Swift Creek chemical complex and MAP. The Swift Creek chemical complex consists of two sulfuric acid plants, one phosphoric acid plant, one SPA plant and one LOMAG plant. In October 2016, MAP production was restarted at the Suwannee River chemical complex. Remaining operations at this facility were closed in 2014.

 The location of our Aurora and White Springs mining operations are shown on the following map. 
 


At our Geismar, Louisiana facility we manufacture phosphoric acid. The Geismar facility has a phosphoric acid plant and a liquid fertilizer plant. A significant portion of the phosphoric acid produced at the Geismar facility is sold as feedstock to Innophos Holdings, Inc. for use in its neighboring purified acid plant. Our other phosphate properties include: 
 

 | animal feed plants in Marseilles, Illinois; Joplin, Missouri; and Weeping Water, Nebraska;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a technical and food grade phosphate plant in Cincinnati, Ohio; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a terminal facility at Morehead City, North Carolina.

Joplin, MO | Animal feed 


(1) | All of the MGA from White Springs is consumed internally in the production of downstream products.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Production 
 We extract phosphate ore using surface mining techniques. At each mine site, the ore is mixed with recycled water to form a slurry, which is pumped from the mine site to our processing 

  facilities. The ore is then screened to remove coarse materials, washed to remove clay and floated to remove sand to produce phosphate rock. The annual production capacity of our mines is currently 9 million tonnes of phosphate rock. During 2016, the Aurora facilitys total production of phosphate rock was 4.92 million tonnes and the White Springs facilitys total production of phosphate rock was 1.73 million tonnes. The sequence for mining portions of the Aurora property has been identified in the permit issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers in June 2009. The permit authorizes mining in excess of 30 years. 
 Phosphate rock is the major input in our phosphorus processing operations. Substantially all of the phosphate rock produced is used internally for the production of phosphoric acid, SPA, chemical fertilizers, purified phosphoric acid and animal feed products. Unlike the Aurora and White Springs operations, to meet certain customers product requirements, the Geismar facility does not mine phosphate rock. Presently, the Geismar facility purchases phosphate rock from the Moroccan Company OCP S.A. 
 In addition to phosphate ore, the other principal raw materials we require are sulfur and ammonia. The production of phosphoric acid requires substantial quantities of sulfur, which we purchase from third parties. Any significant disruption in our sulfur supply to the phosphate facilities could adversely impact our financial results. We produce sulfuric acid at the Aurora and White Springs facilities and our Geismar facility purchases sulfuric acid from third parties. 
 Our phosphate operations purchase all of their ammonia at market rates from or through our nitrogen and sales subsidiaries. Phosphoric acid is reacted with ammonia to produce purified phosphoric acid, DAP and MAP as well as liquid fertilizers. In addition, ammonia operations include the purchase, sale and terminalling of anhydrous ammonia and much of this ammonia is purchased from third parties. Ammonia for Aurora is supplied by rail and truck from our production facilities in Lima, Ohio; Geismar, Louisiana; and Augusta, Georgia. 
 We can produce MGA at our Aurora, White Springs and Geismar facilities. Some MGA from Aurora and Geismar is sold to foreign and domestic fertilizer producers and industrial customers. We further process the balance of the MGA to make solid fertilizer (DAP and MAP); liquid fertilizers; animal feed supplements for the poultry and livestock markets; and purified phosphoric acid for use in a wide variety of food, technical and industrial applications.

----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reserves 
 Our phosphate deposits in North Carolina occur in a formation known as the Pungo River formation of the middle Miocene age. The formation, typically 75 feet to 125 feet below ground surface, is composed of interbedded phosphatic sands, silts and clays, diatomaceous clays and phosphate limestone. Phosphate of value in the ore horizon occurs as pellets of brown and black sand-sized particles, with flat-sided angular quartz grains and variable amounts of silt, clay and interbedded limestone. The phosphate ore (matrix) horizon throughout is distinguished by its relative uniformity in thickness, percent P2O5 and other quality characteristics. 
 Our White Springs operations are in Hamilton County, Florida. The Hamilton County phosphate deposits in the North Florida Phosphate District are reported to be of the middle Miocene and Pliocene ages. Because of partial reworking during the Pliocene age, these deposits tend to be more variable than middle Miocene deposits, such as those found in North Carolina. 
 In connection with our permit at Aurora and the reporting requirements under NI 43-101, the Company engaged Marston & Marston, Inc. (Marston) in late 2009 to update the estimated phosphate ore reserves at both Aurora and White Springs. Marston developed geologic and cost models, mine plans, production schedules and a cash flow estimate for each operation based on (i) a review of Company records and information regarding land areas controlled by the Company, (ii) drilling and sampling databases provided by the Company, (iii) visits to each 

  sites mining operations and discussions with Company personnel familiar with the geology of the phosphate ore deposits and (iv) a phosphate market study. 
 From these, Marston developed both reserve and resource estimates for Aurora and White Springs. 
 The following table sets forth the Companys estimated proven and probable phosphate reserves for Aurora and White Springs as of December 31, 2016 at a stated average grade of 30.66% P2O5. 
 


 | Tonnes ofPhosphate Rock(Millions of tonnes)Stated Average Grade 30.66% P2O5 |

To Be Permitted | | 1.5 | | 0 | | 1.5 
Total | | 99.0 | | 7.8 | | 106.8

 The reserves set forth above for Aurora would permit mining to continue at annual production rates for about 20 years. This mine life is based on an average annual production rate of approximately 4.15 million tonnes of 30.66% concentrate over the 




10 | PotashCorp 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K

 
  three-year period ended December 31, 2016. If mineral deposits covered by the permit at Aurora, and now reclassified as resources, are included, the mine life at Aurora would be about 37 years at such rate of production. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 
 The reserves set forth above for White Springs would permit mining to continue at annual production rates for about 13 years, based on an average annual production rate of approximately 1.86 million tonnes of 30.66% concentrate over the three-year period ended December 31, 2016. Following the closure of the phosphoric acid production operations at the Suwannee River chemical complex in 2014, we forecast a mine life of approximately 14 years based on an average forecasted annual production rate of approximately 1.66 million tonnes of 30.66% concentrate. This mine life is calculated using two years (2015 & 2016) of actual production and one year of budgeted production (2017).
 Resources 
 Mineral resources, which are exclusive of the mineral reserves reported above, are contained within the lands owned or controlled by the Company at each mine. Resources are reported as mineralization in-place with no historical recovery factors applied to quantify the total tonnes, while reserves are reported as recoverable ore, having applied the appropriate historical recovery factors. 
 At both Aurora and White Springs, where geological correlations are well defined, the mineral resource categories are generally characterized by the Company as follows: 
 

 | measured mineral resource  areas with mineral deposit continuity based on 50% of range drill hole distances (2,250 feet) in the geostatistical model;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | indicated mineral resource  areas with mineral deposit continuity based on at-range drill hole distances (4,500 feet) in the geostatistical model; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | inferred mineral resource  areas with mineral deposit continuity based on 150% of range drill hole distances (6,750 feet) in the geostatistical model.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Information used to infer and compute resource tonnage estimates consists of physical sampling (drill holes) and geologic modeling. 

 The Companys estimated mineral resource tonnage as of December 31, 2016 for each of our mines is as follows: 
 


 | Mineral Resource (30.66% P2O5 )(1) | 
 | Measured Resource (Millions of tonnes in-place) | | Indicated Resource (Millions of tonnes in-place) | | Inferred Resource (Millions of tonnes in-place)
Aurora | | 172.7 | | 4.6 | | 
White Springs | | 67.80 | | 0.20 | | 


(1) | Resources are different from reserves and are not in addition to reserves. Resources are defined as tonnes in situ before recovery factors have been applied.

MARKETING 
 We sell to a diverse group of customers both by geography and by end product and, apart from sales of potash to Canpotex Limited (Canpotex), no one customer accounted for more than 10% of our total sales in 2016. Market conditions will vary on a period-over-period basis, and sales can be expected to shift from one period to another.

Information with respect to the geographical locations of certain non-current assets is disclosed in Note 3, Segment Information to the Companys 2016 audited consolidated financial statements, incorporated by reference under Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Potash from our Saskatchewan mines for sale outside Canada and the United States is sold to Canpotex. Following the suspension of our New Brunswick potash operations in early 2016, international customers that were historically served by PCS Sales (Canada), Inc. and PCS Sales (USA), Inc. (PCS Sales) are now served from Saskatchewan production through Canpotex. Nitrogen and phosphate products are marketed and sold in North America and offshore by PCS Sales. See Offshore Marketing below. 

 North American Marketing 
 Potash 
 In 2016, North American sales of potash products represented 52% of our total potash sales, a significant portion of which were attributable to potash customers in the United States. Typically, our North American potash sales are greater in the first half of the year. The vast majority of sales are made on the spot market with the balance made under short-term contracts. We have no material contractual obligations in connection with North American sales to sell potash in the future at a fixed price. 
Nitrogen 
 In 2016, North American sales of nitrogen products represented 83% of our total nitrogen sales, a significant portion of which was attributable to nitrogen customers in the United States. In 2016, our nitrogen product sales were made on the spot market and under short-term and multi-year contracts. We have no material contractual obligations in connection with North American sales to sell nitrogen in the future at a fixed price. 
 Ammonia we purchase is used in our operations and is sold to third party customers by PCS Sales. 
 Phosphate 
 In 2016, North American sales of phosphate products represented 77% of our total phosphate sales, a significant portion of which were attributable to phosphate customers in the United States. In 2016, the majority of our phosphate product sales were made on the spot market, with the balance made under short-term contracts (generally on an annual basis) and a limited number of sales made pursuant to multi-year contracts. We have no material contractual obligations in connection with North American sales to sell phosphate products in the future at a fixed price. 
 The primary customers for fertilizer products are retailers, dealers, cooperatives, distributors and other fertilizer producers. Such retailers, dealers and cooperatives have both distribution and application capabilities. The primary customers for industrial products are chemical product manufacturers and the primary customers for feed products are feed manufacturers. 
 Offshore Marketing 
 Potash 
 Potash we produce in Canada for sale outside Canada and the United States is sold exclusively to Canpotex, which is owned in equal shares by us and two other Canadian potash producers. Canpotex, which was incorporated in 1970 and commenced operations in 1972, acts as an export company providing integrated sales, marketing and distribution for all Canadian potash produced by its shareholders that is exported to 
 destinations outside the United States and Canada. Each shareholder of Canpotex has an equal voting interest as 




12 | PotashCorp 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K

 
  a shareholder and a right to equal representation on the Canpotex board of directors. The shareholders of Canpotex have committed to use Canpotex as their exclusive offshore export outlet for potash produced in Canada that is exported to destinations outside the United States and Canada; however, prior to January 2016, production from our New Brunswick mine was not subject to this requirement and was instead marketed internationally by us outside of Canpotex. In January 2016, we elected for New Brunswick production to also be subject to this exclusivity requirement and announced the suspension of our Picadilly New Brunswick potash operations. Since that time, we have not sold any potash we produce in Canada outside of Canada and the United States independently of Canpotex. 
 In general, Canpotex sales are allocated among the producers based on production capacity. If a shareholder cannot satisfy demand for potash by Canpotex, the remaining shareholders are entitled to satisfy the demand pro rata based on their allotted production capacity. In 2016, we supplied approximately 51.62% of Canpotexs requirements. We expect our Canpotex allocation to change as Canpotexs shareholders complete expansions, including the ramp up of our completed Rocanville expansion. Canpotex generally sells potash to private and public firms and government agencies pursuant to contracts at negotiated prices or by spot sales. 
 The following table sets forth the percentage of sales volumes by Canpotex for the past three calendar years in the various geographical regions. 
 


 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
China | | 16% | | 20% | | 16% 
India | | 9 | | 9 | | 10 
Other Asian markets | | 36 | | 34 | | 41 
Latin America | | 33 | | 30 | | 26 
Other countries | | 6 | | 7 | | 7 
Total | | 100% | | 100% | | 100%

 For 2016, sales to Canpotex represented 48% of our total potash sales. 
 Nitrogen 
 Ammonia and urea predominate our offshore sales of nitrogen and originate primarily from Trinidad, with other sales coming from purchased product locations. For 2016, our offshore sales of nitrogen products represented 17% of our total nitrogen sales. 

Phosphate 
 The Company executes offshore marketing and sales for its solid phosphate fertilizer through PCS Sales. For 2016, the offshore sales of phosphate products represented 23% of our total phosphate sales. 
 Offshore sales are subject to those risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including (i) laws, policies and actions affecting foreign trade; (ii) other economic, political and regulatory policies of foreign governments; (iii) changes in foreign currency and exchange controls; and (iv) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 TRANSPORTATION AND DISTRIBUTION 
 We have an extensive infrastructure and distribution system to store and transport our products. In addition to storage located at our production facilities, in North America in 2016, we leased or owned 296 terminal and warehouse facilities, some of which have multi-product capability, for a total of 409 strategically located distribution points in Canada and the United States to serve our customers. To complement our distribution system in Canada and the United States, we also leased or owned approximately 11,100 railcars. In the offshore market, the Company leased one warehouse in China (which we closed in September 2016), one in Malaysia and had ownership in a joint venture which leases one dry bulk fertilizer port terminal in Brazil. We also leased three vessels used for ammonia transportation and owned one multi-purpose vessel used for molten sulfur and phosphoric acid transportation. 
Potash 
 Transportation costs can be a significant component of the total cost of potash. Producers may have an advantage in serving markets close to their sources of supply depending on prevailing transportation costs. International shipping cost variances permit offshore producers (including those in the former Soviet Union, Germany and the Middle East) to compete with us effectively in many geographies. 
 Most of our potash for North American customers is shipped by rail. We believe we have a strategic advantage in this market with more than 208 owned or leased potash distribution points and a fleet of approximately 4,700 owned and leased railcars. We believe this is the most extensive domestic distribution network in the potash business. Shipments are also made by rail from each of our Saskatchewan mines to Thunder Bay, Ontario, for shipment by lake vessel to our warehouses and storage facilities in Canada and the United States. 




PotashCorp 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 13

 
 In the case of our sales to Canpotex, potash is transported by rail principally to Vancouver, British Columbia, where port facilities store potash pending shipment by ocean-going vessels overseas. We have an equity interest in Canpotex Bulk Terminals Limited, which is a part owner of these port facilities. Through Canpotex, we also transport potash to, and have an interest in, a port facility located in Portland, Oregon. Following the suspension of our Picadilly, New Brunswick potash operations in early 2016, storage and loading facilities at the Port of Saint John  including our capacity of up to 2.5 million tonnes per year  have been made available to Canpotex for offshore shipping. 
 Nitrogen 
 We distribute our nitrogen products by vessel, barge, railcar, truck and direct pipeline to our customers and, in high consumption areas, through our strategically located storage terminals. We lease or own 92 nitrogen terminal facilities. The terminals provide off-season storage and also serve local dealers during the peak seasonal demand period. 
 We distribute products from Trinidad primarily to markets in the United States and also to Latin America. Our distribution operations in Trinidad employ three long-term chartered ocean-going vessels and utilize short-term and spot charters as necessary for the transportation of ammonia. All bulk urea production from Trinidad is shipped through third-party carriers. 
 Phosphate 
 With respect to phosphates, we have long-term leases on shipping terminals in Morehead City and Beaufort, North Carolina, through which we receive and store Aurora facility raw materials and finished product. Most of our offshore phosphate sales are shipped through the terminal at Morehead City. We use barges and tugboats to transport solid products, phosphoric acid and sulfur between the Aurora facility and shipping terminals. Raw materials and products, including sulfur, are also transported to and from the Aurora facility by rail. 
 Sulfur is delivered to the White Springs facility by rail and truck from Canada and the United States. Most of the phosphoric acid and chemical fertilizers produced at the White Springs facility are shipped to North American destinations by rail. Ammonia for Aurora is supplied by rail and truck from our production facilities in Lima, Ohio; Geismar, Louisiana; and Augusta, Georgia. Much of the Geismar facilitys phosphoric acid is delivered via pipeline to a nearby customer. The balance of the facilitys phosphate products is shipped by rail or tank truck. Phosphate rock feedstock is delivered to Geismar from Morocco in large ocean-going vessels. Sulfur is delivered to the Geismar facility by barge, truck and rail. 

 COMPETITION 
 Potash 
 Potash is a commodity, characterized by minimal product differentiation, and, consequently, producers compete based on price, quality and service. We price competitively and sell high quality products and provide high quality service to our customers. Our service includes maintaining warehouses, leasing railcars and chartering ocean-going vessels to enhance our delivery capabilities. The high cost of transporting potash affects competition in various geographic areas. During 2016 our principal competitors in North America included Agrium, Belaruskali, ICL, Intrepid Potash Inc., K+S Group, Mosaic, SQM and Uralkali. In 2016, in offshore markets, Canpotex competed with producers such as APC, Belaruskali, ICL, K+S Group, SQM & Uralkali. 
Nitrogen 
 Nitrogen, the most widely produced nutrient globally, is primarily a regional business. However, ammonia, the feedstock for all downstream nitrogen products, may be manufactured in countries with adequate natural gas supplies and can enable developing nations to monetize their natural gas resources. Several countries with large reserves and low production costs use little of their gas domestically, and can produce ammonia cheaply for the export market. Natural gas typically makes up 70-85% of the cash cost of producing a tonne of ammonia. Nitrogen solutions and ammonium sulfate are also exported. 
 Nitrogen is an input into industrial production of a wide range of products. Many manufacturers want consistent quality and just-in-time delivery to keep their plants running. A number of industrial consumers are connected to their suppliers by pipeline. 
 Our nitrogen production serves fertilizer, industrial and feed customers. Our US plants primarily supply industrial and feed customers, and Trinidad supplies both our fertilizer and industrial customers. Our US production has benefited recently from the low cost of natural gas. In Trinidad, our natural gas contracts are primarily indexed to Tampa, Florida ammonia prices. Within North America, sales are regionalized due to transportation costs. In the United States, we compete with other domestic producers, including Agrium, CF Industries Holdings, Inc., CVR Partners, L.P., Koch Industries, Inc., LSB Industries, INC., and OCI N.V. and with imported product from suppliers in the Middle East, North Africa, Trinidad, the former Soviet Union and China. In the offshore market, we compete with a wide range of offshore and domestic producers. 




14 | PotashCorp 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K

Phosphate 
 Markets for phosphate fertilizer products are highly competitive. Our principal advantages at Aurora and White Springs are that we produce higher value, diversified products and that we operate integrated phosphate mine and phosphate processing complexes, while some of our North American competitors are required to ship phosphate rock by rail or truck greater distances from their mines to their mineral processing plants, thus incurring higher rock processing costs. 
 Our competitors for North American phosphate fertilizer sales are The Mosaic Company, J.R. Simplot Company, Agrium and offshore imports primarily from China, Morocco and Russia. 
 In offshore markets, we compete primarily with Moroccos OCP S.A., as well as producers from Africa and the Middle East. 
 Within the animal feed supplement business in the phosphate segment, opportunities exist to differentiate products based on nutritional content. We have a significant presence in the domestic feed supplement market segments. We compete with The Mosaic Company, J.R. Simplot Company and Chinese and Russian producers for feed sales. 
 Industrial products are the least commodity-like of the phosphate products as product quality is a more significant consideration for customer buying decisions. We market industrial phosphate products principally in the United States and we compete with ICL, Innophos Holdings, Inc. and Chinese producers for North American industrial sales. 
 EMPLOYEES 
 At December 31, 2016, we employed 5,130 people, of whom 1,954 were salaried and 3,176 were hourly paid. Of these 5,130 employees, our potash operations employed 2,331 people, our nitrogen operations 823 and our phosphate operations 1,515.
 Our sales and transportation and distribution functions were handled by 100 employees in Northbrook, Illinois and various other locations in the United States and by 13 employees in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Excluding sales personnel, the Saskatoon and Northbrook offices together had a corporate staff of 348. 
 We have entered into eight collective bargaining agreements with labor organizations representing employees. The following table 

  sets forth the plant locations where we have entered into collective bargaining agreements and their respective expiry dates. 
 


Plant Location | Collective BargainingAgreement Expiry Date

 We believe we have an effective working relationship with our employees, and the unions representing them. 
 ROYALTIES AND TAXES 
 Under Saskatchewan provincial legislation, the Company is subject to resource taxes including the potash production tax and the resource surcharge. In 2015, the Government of Saskatchewan announced a potash royalty and taxation review which was postponed indefinitely in 2016. The potash production tax totaled $74 million and the total resource surcharge was $43 million in 2016. 
 In addition to the potash production tax and resource surcharge, there are royalties, taxes and rental fees payable to the Provinces of Saskatchewan and New Brunswick, municipalities and others in respect of potash sales, production or property in those provinces. Such costs are included in cost of goods sold. The amount of these royalties, taxes and fees totaled $57 million in 2016. 
 There are property and other taxes payable to US governments, municipalities and other entities that are included in cost of goods sold. The amount for these property and other taxes totaled $19 million in 2016. 
 For 2016, miscellaneous taxes (not included above) totaled $7 million. Information on a proposed carbon tax, is included under Legal and Other Matters  General in Note 30 Contingencies and Other Matters, on page 162 of the Companys audited financial statements in our 2016 Annual Integrated Report, attached as Exhibit 13, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Income Taxes 
 PCS and certain subsidiaries are subject to federal and provincial income taxes in Canada. Our subsidiaries that operate in the United States are subject to US federal and state income taxes. Our nitrogen subsidiary operating in Trinidad is subject to Trinidadian taxes. 
 Income taxes decreased due primarily to significantly lower income before taxes in higher tax jurisdictions. Effective tax rates were as follows: 
 


 | 2016 | 2015 | 
Actual effective tax rate on ordinary earnings | 16% | | 27%
Actual effective tax rate including discrete items | 12% | | 26%

 Total discrete tax adjustments that impacted the rate in 2016 resulted in an income tax recovery of $17 million (2015  recovery of $7 million). Significant items to note included the following: 
 

 | in 2016, a current tax recovery of $16 million was recorded as a result of tax authority examinations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | in 2015, a current tax recovery of $17 million was recorded upon the conclusion of a tax authority audit.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 Our operations are subject to numerous environmental requirements under federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations of Canada, the United States and Trinidad and Tobago. These laws and regulations govern matters such as air emissions, wastewater discharges, land use and reclamation, groundwater quality, and solid and hazardous waste management. Many of these laws, regulations and permit requirements are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. 
 The Safety, Health and Environment Committee of the Board of Directors measures the Companys safety, health, environmental and security performance against our management policies and procedures. The committee also monitors progress against our safety and environmental goals and targets, working closely with management to ensure that appropriate strategies and processes are in place to promote a culture that prioritizes safety and environmental responsibility. 
 Our operating expenses, other than costs associated with asset retirement obligations, relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations governing ongoing operations for 2016 were $95 million (2015  $111 million, 2014  $129 million). 
 The Company routinely undertakes environmental capital projects. In 2016, capital expenditures of $82 million (2015  $164 million, 

  2014  $151 million) were incurred to meet pollution prevention and control as well as other environmental objectives. Future capital expenditures are subject to a number of uncertainties, including changes to environmental regulations and interpretations, and enforcement initiatives. While we currently anticipate that our operating and capital expenditures related to environmental regulatory matters in 2017 will not differ materially from amounts expended in the past two years, at this time we are unable to estimate the capital expenditures we may make in subsequent years to meet pollution prevention and control objectives as well as other environmental targets. 
 Environmental Requirements, Permits and Regulatory Approvals 
 Many of our operations and facilities are required to operate in compliance with a range of regulatory requirements, permits and approvals. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with existing regulatory programs, permits and approvals. Permits and approvals typically have to be renewed or reissued periodically. We may also become subject to new laws or regulations that impose new requirements or require us to obtain new or additional permits or approvals. However, there can be no assurance that such permits or approvals will be issued in the ordinary course. Further, the terms and conditions of future regulations, permits and approvals may be more stringent and may require increased expenditures on our part. 
 Air Quality. With respect to air emissions, we anticipate that additional actions and expenditures may be required to meet increasingly stringent US federal and state regulatory and permit requirements, including existing and anticipated regulations under the federal Clean Air Act. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has issued a number of regulations establishing requirements to reduce air pollutant emissions. We continue to monitor developments in these various programs and to assess their potential impact on our operations. 
 Water Quality. There are international, federal and state regulatory initiatives underway that may result in new regulatory restrictions on discharges of nutrients, including nitrogen and phosphorus, to waters in the United States (Nutrient Criteria). There are also ongoing litigation efforts in several jurisdictions of the United States that seek to require US environmental agencies to develop new Nutrient Criteria. These litigation and regulatory proceedings may result in new Nutrient Criteria that apply to water discharges from several of the Companys facilities. Some of the proposed restrictions imposed through Nutrient Criteria also have the potential to require our customers to reduce or eliminate their uses of the Companys products. These Nutrient Criteria could have a material effect on either the Company or its customers, but the impact is not currently predictable or quantifiable with 


16 | PotashCorp 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K

 
  reasonable certainty because many of these initiatives are in relatively early stages and compliance alternatives may be available that do not create material impacts. The Company is closely monitoring and evaluating the impact of these initiatives on its operations. 
 Climate Change. We have determined that we will pursue a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy. A source of greenhouse gases from our operations is process emissions from some of our nitric acid plants. In addition, the use of natural gas at our mines and as a feedstock in our ammonia production results in greenhouse gas emissions. The use of electricity and the transportation of materials associated with our operations are indirect sources of greenhouse gases. The Company has set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions per tonne of nitrogen product by 5 percent from 2014 levels by 2018. 
 We continue to monitor the international and national efforts to address climate change. Increasing regulation of greenhouse gases could impact our operations by requiring changes to our production processes or increasing raw material, energy, production or transportation costs. The countries where we operate are parties to the Paris Agreement adopted in December 2015 pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The impacts of these regulatory efforts on the Companys operations cannot be determined with any certainty at this time. 
 In addition to the foregoing, the information under Legal and Other Matters  General in Note 30, Contingencies and Other Matters on page 162 of the Companys audited consolidated financial statements in our 2016 Annual Integrated Report, attached as Exhibit 13, is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Asset Retirement Obligations 
 Provisions are recognized when: (1) the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; (2) it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and (3) the amount has been reliably estimated. We have recorded in the Companys audited consolidated financial statements provisions for decommissioning obligations (also known as asset retirement obligations) primarily related to mining and mineral activities. The major categories of asset retirement obligations include reclamation and restoration costs at our potash and phosphate mining operations (most particularly phosphate mining), including the management of materials generated by mining and mineral processing, such as various mine tailings and gypsum; land reclamation and revegetation programs; decommissioning of underground and surface operating facilities; general clean-up activities aimed at returning the areas to an environmentally acceptable condition; and post-closure care and maintenance. See Note 18 of the Companys audited consolidated financial statements in the 2016 Annual Integrated Report for further discussion of the treatment of asset retirement obligations. 

 The estimation of asset retirement obligation costs depends on the development of environmentally acceptable closure and post-closure plans. In some cases, this may require significant research and development to identify preferred methods for such plans that are economically sound and that, in most cases, may not be implemented for several decades. We have continued to use appropriate technical resources, including outside consultants, to develop specific site closure and post-closure plans in accordance with the requirements of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The asset retirement obligations are generally incurred over an extended period of time. At December 31, 2016, we had accrued a total of $678 million for asset retirement obligations. The current portion totaled $51 million. 
 In addition, the information contained in paragraphs five through seven of Supporting Information of Note 25, Guarantees to the Companys audited consolidated financial statements on page 144 of the Companys 2016 Annual Integrated Report, attached as Exhibit 13, is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Site Assessment and Remediation 
 We are also subject to environmental statutes that address investigation and, where necessary, remediation of contaminated properties. The US Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, (CERCLA), and other US federal and state laws impose liability on, among others, past and present owners and operators of properties or facilities at which hazardous substances have been released into the environment and persons who arrange for disposal of hazardous substances that are released into the environment. Liability under these laws may be imposed jointly and severally and without regard to fault or the legality of the original actions, although such liability may be divided or allocated according to various equitable and other factors. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs and liabilities because of our current and former operations, including those of divested and acquired businesses. We have generated and, with respect to our current operations, continue to generate substances that could result in liability for us under these laws. 
 We have accrued $23 million for costs associated with site assessment and remediation, including consulting fees, related to the clean-up of contaminated sites currently or formerly associated with the Company or its predecessors businesses. The current portion of these costs totaled $7 million. The accrued amounts include the Companys or its subsidiaries expected final share of the costs for the site assessment and remediation matters to the extent the incurrence of the costs are likely and can be reasonably estimated. 
 In addition to the foregoing, the information in the first and second paragraphs under Nitrogen and Phosphate, including the bullets contained therein, and in the second paragraph of 




PotashCorp 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 17

 
  Legal and Other Matters of Note 30, Contingencies and Other Matters to the Companys audited consolidated financial statements on pages 161 and 162 of the Companys 2016 Annual Integrated Report, attached as Exhibit 13, is incorporated herein by reference. 
 It is often difficult to estimate and predict the potential costs and liabilities associated with these programs, and there is no guarantee that we will not in the future be identified as potentially responsible for additional costs under these programs, either as a result of changes in existing laws and regulations or as a result of the identification of additional matters or properties covered by these programs. 
 Facility and Product Security 
 Through our Safety, Health and Environment department, we regularly evaluate and address actual and potential security issues and requirements associated with our operations in the 

  United States and elsewhere using approved security vulnerability methodologies. Additional actions and expenditures may be required in the future. In the United States, chemical facilities are regulated under the Maritime Transportation Security Act, the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, and the Food Safety Modernization Act (Mitigation Strategies to Protect Food Against Adulteration). It is anticipated that Congress will continue to consider federal legislation designed to reduce the risk of any future terrorist acts at industrial facilities. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable security requirements, and we also have developed and adopted security measures and enhancements beyond those presently required at both our regulated and non-regulated facilities. To date, neither the security regulations nor our expenditures on security matters have had a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. We are unable to predict the potential future costs to us of any new governmental programs or voluntary initiatives.
