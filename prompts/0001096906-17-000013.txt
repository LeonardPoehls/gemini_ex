Item 1.  Business
 
PASSUR Aerospace, Inc. ("PASSUR" or the "Company"), a New York corporation founded in 1967, is a leading business intelligence company, providing predictive analytics and decision support technology for the aviation industry primarily to improve the operational performance and cash flow of airlines and the airports where they operate. The Company is recognized as a leader in airline and airport operational efficiency and business aviation marketing and operational solutions, and is a pioneer in the successful use of big data, with an aviation intelligence platform and suite of web-based solutions that address the aviation industry's most intractable and costly challenges, including underutilization of airspace and airport capacity, delays, cancellations, and diversions, among others. Several independent studies have estimated the annual direct and indirect costs of such inefficiencies in the United States at over $30 billion annually. The Company's technology platform is supported by its Aviation Intelligence Center of Excellence, a team of subject matter experts with extensive experience in airline, airport, and business aviation operations, finance, air traffic management, systems automation, and data visualization, with specific expertise in the operational and business needs, requirements, objectives, and constraints of the aviation industry.
 
PASSUR's mission is to improve global air traffic efficiencies by connecting the world's aviation professionals onto a single aviation intelligence platform, making PASSUR an essential element in tackling the $30 billion of system-wide inefficiencies. We are an aviation intelligence company that makes air travel more predictable, gate-to-gate, by using predictive analytics generated from our own big data – to mitigate constraints for airlines and their customers. PASSUR's information solutions are used by the largest five North American airlines, more than 60 airport customers, including 22 of the top 30 North American airports (with PASSUR solutions also used at the remaining eight airports by one or more airline customers), hundreds of corporate aviation customers, as well as the U.S. government.
 
PASSUR provides data aggregation and consolidation, information, decision support, predictive analytics, collaborative solutions, and professional services. To enable this unique offering, PASSUR owns and operates the largest commercial passive radar network in the world that updates flight tracks every 1 to 4.6 seconds, powering a proprietary database that is accessible in real-time and delivers timely, accurate information and solutions via PASSUR's industry-leading algorithms and business logic included in its products.

Solutions offered by PASSUR help to ensure flight completion, covering the entire flight life cycle, from gate to gate, and result in reductions in overall costs and carbon emissions, while maximizing revenue opportunities, as well as improving operational efficiency and enhancing the passenger experience.
 
PASSUR's commercial solutions give aviation operators the ability to optimize performance in today's air traffic management system, while also achieving Next Generation Air Transportation System ("NextGen") objectives.
 
PASSUR integrates data from multiple sources, including its independent network of over 180 surveillance sensors installed throughout North America creating coast to coast coverage, as well as locations in Europe and Asia; government data; customer data; and data from third party partners. PASSUR's sensors receive aircraft and drone signals in Mode A, C, S, and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast ("ADS-B"), providing position, altitude, beacon code, and tail number, among other information. PASSUR receives signals from aircraft that, when combined with our historical database of aircraft and airport behavior, including information recorded by our network over the last 10 years, allows the Company to know more about what has happened historically, and what is happening in real-time. In addition, the historical database allows the Company to predict how aircraft, the airspace, and airports are going to perform, and more importantly, how the aircraft, the airspace, and airport should perform.

PASSUR Core Capabilities
 
Integrated Surveillance Network and Integrated Aviation Database
 
The Company operates what it believes to be the largest and most extensive private commercial aircraft, airport, and airspace passive surveillance networks in the world. The PASSUR Network integrates additional key surveillance sources, to include ADS-B, ASDE-X, Mode S, En Route Radar, Airline OOOI data, ACARS, fleet databases, as well as other sources. PASSUR also integrates extensive amounts of data from its customer's systems, such as airline on-board communications messages ("ACARS") and Airport Operational Databases ("AODB").
 
The PASSUR Network and database creates a direct data feed of critical flight and airspace behavior and conditions, an essential precursor resource for predictive analytics, real-time decision support, and performance analysis tools.
 
All the surveillance data acquired by the PASSUR Network is integrated and correlated into specialized databases to support predictive, real-time, and post operational requirements. PASSUR databases consolidate multiple overlapping data sets to ensure completeness, accuracy, fulfillment of specific operational requirements, and the normalization of data for a single-source authoritative record of operational performance. The data processed in these master data repositories supports the key capabilities and attributes of the PASSUR software.

Predictive Analytics
 
PASSUR decision support solutions are supported by predictive analytics algorithms, which use extensive historical data mining and pattern recognition, along with real-time surveillance data, to predict specific and detailed operating conditions. PASSUR predictive analytics are built on several core capabilities:
 

• | Real-time surveillance from the PASSUR Network gives the necessary breadth and granularity of data to support detailed scenario building and pattern recognition. This includes "fast-time simulation" of the airport surface and terminal area operation, applying the necessary decisions and constraints that controllers will have to apply in managing the traffic, as well as addressing the highly nonlinear and non-stationary nature, of the airport operating environment. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Detailed, granular data acquired by the PASSUR Network, supplemented by many other data sources collected within the integrated aviation database, is stored and correlated, providing the large sample sizes required to accurately model future performance based on past performance under similar or identical conditions. 
• | PASSUR is recognized by airlines as having the best flight predicted arrival time (Estimated Time of Arrival, "ETA") in the industry. More than ten independent airline studies have demonstrated the PASSUR predicted arrival time to be more accurate than any other source, including the airlines' own internally-generated ETAs. The Company believes that this greater accuracy translates directly into significant operational and financial benefits in areas such as completing connections (passengers and bags), reduced fuel consumption, more efficient staffing plans, and greater on-time schedule completion.

PASSUR Integrated Traffic Management
 
PASSUR Integrated Traffic Management ("PITM") is, in the Company's opinion, the industry's first fully integrated air traffic optimization suite. PITM is a metrics-focused, Key Performance Indicator ("KPI") driven solution suite allowing the customer to first view the most critical information for its operation, and then, as necessary, enabling the user to drill down for better visualization and analysis.
 
PITM helps airlines complete their mission, on time, by focusing on the major operational constraints such as diversions, arrival and departure flow congestion, and airport surface congestion – as well as major irregular operations like disruptive weather, construction closures, large public events, and emergency incidents. The platform connects multiple aviation stakeholders and missions onto one platform, providing a collaborative environment within and between organizations, to address decisions that can only be solved through the real-time exchange of information on a common operating platform. PITM is also a platform enabling PASSUR's partner companies to provide solutions which augment PASSUR capabilities to PASSUR's customers. PITM is fully web-delivered, allowing easy access from any web-enabled device.
 
Decision Support Dashboards, KPIs, and Management by Exception
 
Many PASSUR solutions are delivered in metrics-driven, dashboard format, simplifying and condensing extensive amounts of information into the most relevant operational and business metrics, thereby presenting those metrics in a manner that supports immediate performance assessment and actionable decisions. PASSUR solutions are designed so that users are alerted in real-time to specific conditions and recommended actions, especially during irregular operations, only when operations reach certain user-defined thresholds, thereby preventing information overload.
Collaborative Capabilities and Industrial Networks
 
Many PASSUR solutions include a collaborative layer which allows for instant information sharing and coordination of effort to a wide range of users in the aviation community. These include industrial networking capabilities, which leverage new technologies for business uses in the aviation sector, such as PASSUR's Airport Information Network, a single North American-wide site for real time airport conditions, diversion management, and delay mitigation used by hundreds of aviation professionals. Other PASSUR collaborative capabilities include pre-departure sequencing and/or metering, arrival sequencing, and tarmac delay management.

The Company believes its business opportunities come from the following industry conditions and demand drivers:
 
Airline Industry Dynamics
 

· | Increasing airline profitability, driving investment in technology. We expect airlines will take advantage of their increased profitability to invest in technology that can lower costs, increase revenue, and improve customer satisfaction. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Consolidation in the airline industry creating demand for a common operating system. Airlines are consolidating into much larger networks of greater complexity. There is increasing demand for a common operating platform that can service their entire system. 
· | Current rate of projected traffic growth outpacing aviation infrastructure capacity. There is a dynamic and fast-growing market environment where the projected increase in airline flights over the next 10 years is expected to outpace the current infrastructure's ability to meet the needs of the airline operators. Over time, airlines cannot rely on low-priced fuel and ancillary fees to grow their top line – they will need growth in capacity of the NAS to accommodate the expected growth in demand for air travel. PASSUR's solutions help the aviation industry maximize the capacity of the existing infrastructure. PASSUR has a business model and platform that can be easily scaled to handle new opportunities and is continually identifying new ways to capitalize on and scale these existing capabilities.
· | Increased susceptibility to systemic disruption. The NAS has become much more sensitive to disruptions, and less capable of quickly rebounding, because of tightly-packed airline schedules, growth in passenger volumes, reduction in fleet sizes, and congestion at several key airport metroplexes. The NAS is highly susceptible to disruptions at several key airport metroplexes, which have a chronic and disproportionate delay impact that ripples across the system. 

Government Policy
 

· | New emphasis on infrastructure spending. The most recent U.S. election has resulted in an administration committed to large-scale infrastructure projects, which could include technologies, like PASSUR's, designed to increase efficiencies to ensure that public investments in existing and new infrastructure are efficient and cost-effective. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | New large government contracts combining both safety and efficiency capabilities. Today, there is a demand for a combination of safety-based Air Traffic Management ("ATM") and efficiency-based ATM. Many of the requested efficiency capabilities are derived from airline and airport customers' needs. 
· | Government contracts require proven commercial viability for public programs. Increasingly, government RFPs for large-scale aviation systems and technologies require a proven track record of precursor models from the commercial sector, in order to shorten development time and ensure the broadest level of adoption by all stakeholders. Many companies regard PASSUR's substantial commercial market share as a means to increase the probability of winning NextGen and government contracts through the combination of PASSUR's commercial ATM (efficiency) with a partner's government ATM (safety) capabilities. PASSUR has been recognized as the commercial leader in aviation efficiency solutions.
· | Lower tolerance for severe disruptions. Public policy in the form of expensive fines levied on airlines reflects this change of attitude. Consumers want better information relating to aviation, and fewer delays. 
· | Limiting carbon emissions becoming a greater focus. Airlines are increasingly sensitive to the industry's carbon footprint. Several of the PASSUR solutions impact both fuel savings as well as reductions in carbon emissions. 

The Connected Airplane and Internet of Things ("IoT")
 

· | The Connected Airplane and the IoT are expected to grow in the coming years. PASSUR's existing aviation intelligence platform and solutions can integrate the vast array of data being generated from satellites, and sensors on airplanes. This platform can extract the most important data and integrate that data into a user-friendly solutions package for the user's critical real-time decisions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Collaborative Decision Making
 

· | Airlines, airports, government, and other aviation stakeholders are requesting a collaborative decision making platform. Large airlines need collaborative decision tools including common operating platforms, enabling instant coordination between system operations departments, hubs, and regional operators, and between airlines and airports, to solve complex operational procedures. Common use systems will incorporate airport-centric as well as airline-centric solutions. Airports are increasingly being tasked with providing more multi-airline operational services, previously provided by each airline. When airports provide collective services, redundancy and costs can be reduced. PASSUR has been asked by airlines and airports to help fulfill this need.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 Page 9 of 54
 
Automation and Data Standards
 

· | Significant shift from manual processes to automation creating large opportunities for cost savings and efficiencies. Many complex and expensive operational processes at airlines and airports are still manual, opening a large opportunity for automation enabling the realization of cost savings and efficiencies. These opportunities are especially prevalent in the areas of irregular operations, airspace and surface management, and operations where there is a heavy requirement for collaboration among airlines and airports.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | PASSUR's entire network has been ADS-B ready for some time and PASSUR is looking forward to capitalizing on the increasing availability of ADS-B data. ADS-B will eventually become a ubiquitous form of aircraft surveillance. 

How PASSUR Generates Revenue
 
The Company's revenues are generated by selling: (1) subscription-based, real-time decision and solution information and (2) professional services. Under the subscription model, the customer typically signs a contract for access to the information services ranging from one year to five years. The agreement also provides that the information from the PASSUR Network cannot be resold, used by others, or used for unauthorized purposes.
Distribution Method
 
The Company's direct sales force sells its products, as do authorized distributors or integrators who sell PASSUR's products as part of their total solution, e.g. for environmental management.
Competition
 
PASSUR has developed a full suite of capabilities to reduce inefficiencies and improve performance across the markets it serves. There is no other company, to PASSUR's knowledge, which offers these capabilities. There are, however, other forms of flight tracking, surveillance, and aviation business intelligence products. Depending on the end use of the Company's products, primary competitors include Sabre, Airbus, Saab, The Weather Company/IBM, and Harris Corporation. The Company also sells certain data solutions through systems integrators, including Bruel & Kjaer, some of which may also sell products that are competitive with those offered by the Company. Most of these companies have larger sales forces and greater financial resources than the Company.
Source of Materials
 
The Company obtains its components from distributors and manufacturers throughout the United States. The Company has multiple sources from which to obtain a majority of its components.
Dependence on Certain Customers
 
Three customers accounted for 45%, or $6,698,000, of total revenues in fiscal year 2016. One customer accounted for 17% or $2,555,000, a second customer accounted for 17% or $2,460,000, and a third customer accounted for 11% or $1,683,000 of total revenues in fiscal year 2016. One of PASSUR'S customers, who accounted for 11% of total revenues during fiscal year 2016, did not renew a contract that expired on December 31, 2016.  However, PASSUR believes that the impact from the revenue to be recognized from new customer contracts previously signed during fiscal year 2016, and the anticipated revenues from either that company and/or new customer acquisitions in fiscal year 2017, is expected to offset the non-renewal of this agreement in fiscal year 2017. Three customers accounted for 41%, or $5,094,000, of total revenues in fiscal year 2015. One customer accounted for 14% or $1,740,000, a second customer accounted for 13% or $1,692,000, and a third customer accounted for 13% or $1,662,000 of total revenues in fiscal year 2015. As of October 31, 2016, the Company had three customers each of which accounted for 10% or more of the accounts receivable balance. One customer accounted for 30%, or $330,000, a second customer accounted for 19%, or $213,000, and a third customer accounted for 14%, or $157,000.
