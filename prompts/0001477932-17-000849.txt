ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Our Corporate History and Structure
 
Environmental Packaging Technologies Holdings, Inc. (the "Company", "we, "us", or "our") was incorporated in Nevada on November 17, 2011, under the name "GS Valet, Inc." On December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement with Garden State Valet, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company ("Garden State Valet"), and the unit-holders of Garden State Valet (the "Unit-holders") to purchase all of the outstanding units of Garden State Valet. Garden State Valet was formed on June 15, 2011.
 
On August 9, 2013, six investors acquired 27,134,875 shares of our common stock then held by Neil Scheckter, who was our sole officer and director at the time. As a result, there was a change of control, as Mr. Scheckter relinquished his control of the Company and resigned from his positions. Immediately following their acquisition of the shares, one of the investors caused 8,886,663 shares that he acquired from Mr. Scheckter to be cancelled.
 
Also on August 9 and December 9, 2013, we sold a total of 4,070,581 shares of our common stock to four accredited investors (the "Investors") at $1.965 per share or gross proceeds of $8 million (the "Proceeds"), including $3 million in cash and $5 million in promissory notes issued by Preciosa Streaming Company Inc., a Barbados company ("Preciosa"). Preciosa issued the notes to two of the Investors, who in turn assigned them to us. Preciosa repaid the notes to us in full in September 2013.
 
On December 9, 2013, we further sold 3,328,181 shares of our common stock at $0.000046 per share for gross proceeds of $153.
 
We intended to use the Proceeds to pursue a metals streaming business by acquiring and managing precious metals streams, royalties and other similar interests. A stream is a non-operating interest in a mining project that provides the right to purchase metals produced from such project for a fixed price for a specified period of time in exchange for an upfront payment with such terms defined in the metals purchase agreement. Royalties are non-operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to revenue or metals produced from the project after deducting specified costs, if any.
 
In connection to our metals streaming plans:
 


· | we changed our name from "GS Valet, Inc." to "International Metals Streaming Corp." on September 26, 2013;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | we changed our fiscal year end from September 30 to December 31, effective on September 26, 2013; and 
· | the operations of Garden State Valet ceased on October 1, 2013. 

 On March 10, 2014, due to our determination that the metals streaming business was no longer desirable, we rescinded our transactions with the Investors whereby: 



· | each Investor agreed to return the shares of our common stock issued to such Investor; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | we remitted to each Investor a portion of the then remaining Proceeds pro rata to the shares of our common stock issued to such Investor; and
· | we and the Investors agreed to release all claims we may have against one another. 

 
Accordingly, 4,070,581 shares in the aggregate were surrendered to us for cancellation. In addition, in November 2015, two additional shareholders surrendered an aggregate 3,328,181 shares of our common stock for cancellation and as thus as of December 31, 2015, there were 26,253,000 shares of our common stock outstanding. On September 22, 2016, the former sole officer and director surrendered an aggregate of 2,442,139 shares of our common which were cancelled for no consideration.

Recent Developments
 
On December 28, 2016, we entered into an Agreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with EPT Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”), and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of ours and Environmental Packaging Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“EPT”). 
 
EPT was incorporated in 2011 with headquarters in Houston, Texas, manufacturing facilities in Zeeland, Michigan, operations in over five countries and sales in over twenty-eight countries throughout the world. EPT believes it has developed an efficient and economical way to safely transport bulk, non-hazardous liquids, offering products that provide innovative solutions to meet growing global demand. It has created a patented transportation system that consists of a two-ply plastic tube encased in a woven material that can be filled with up to 6,340 gallons of liquid. EPT primarily has two separate products – the Big Red Flexitank and its newest product Liquiride, launched in 2016. EPT’s products have been used to ship hundreds of different products from bio diesel, wine, juice, milk, high-fructose corn syrup, and even liquid latex. The Big Red Flexitank is a large single bag that fits within a 20’ shipping container and is secured by bulkheads. It has certifications for shipping on most of the world’s railways, roads and ships – a very difficult and time consuming process. EPT believes that it has the premiere product as it has a long history of the fewest leaks within the industry, with substantially less than 0.1% of all tanks developing a problem. In 2015, EPT sold approximately 20,000 Flexitanks and generated $16.5 million in revenues from those sales.
 
The newest product, Liquiride, is believed by EPT to be the only liquid shipping product that works for use with standard 40’ and 53’ shipping containers. A unique feature of Liquiride is the capability to have multiple flexitanks filled with different liquids within a single shipping container. EPT also believes that it is also the only product in which temperature control can be guaranteed as it can be shipped within a refrigerated (“reefer”) container. Liquiride has recently received certifications from the US and Canadian rail and highway authorities.
 
EPT has recently reached a five-year contractual agreement with one of the world’s largest shipping companies for the exclusive use of Liquiride within this company’s ocean-going reefer containers. EPT believe that this relationship will significantly increase revenues over the next several years.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to and upon the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into EPT (the “Merger”) and EPT shall be the surviving corporation of the Merger and EPT shall become, as a result of the Merger, our direct wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
Immediately following the Merger, we shall have approximately 52,000,000 shares issued and outstanding of which (a) 40,000,000 such shares will be owned by the former EPT Stockholders, and (b) approximately 12,000,000 shares will be owned by our current shareholders. Upon completion of the Merger, the individuals designated by EPT shall be our sole directors and officers our current officer and director shall resign.
 
The Merger Agreement includes conditions, representations and warranties and covenants of the parties customary for a transaction of this nature. The Merger Agreement may be terminated after March 31, 2017 if the Merger has not closed by that date.
 
The foregoing descriptions of the Merger Agreement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is referenced by the registrant's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 29, 2016.
 
On February 1, 2017, the Company’s director and holders the majority of the Company’s outstanding stock by written consent approved a name change from International Metals Streaming Corp. to Environmental Packaging Technologies Holdings, Inc. Further, in February 2017, the Company’s director approved a forward split of the Company’s outstanding and authorized common stock at a ratio of 2.17079 to 1. Both actions were filed with Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. The Company also requested that Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) change the symbol from IMST to EPTI. The Company submitted an issuer company-related action notification form to FINRA requesting FINRA approve the name change, forward split and symbol change. The Company received FINRA’s approval on February 14, 2017 with an effective date of February 16, 2017 for the name change and forward stock split. The symbol change will be effective as of February 28, 2017.

Going Concern
 
Based on our financial history since inception, our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion in its audit report included in the financial statements that are a part of this annual report on Form 10-K (this "Report"). We are a shell company that has generated minimal revenues and, following the termination of our metals streaming business plan and the refund of the remaining Proceeds to the Investors in March 2014, currently has nominal assets. As a shell company, our new business plan is to seek, acquire or merge with a business or company. Our business operations are subject to all the risks and the uncertainties arising from the absence of a significant operating history and limited capital resources. No assurances can be given that we will ever be able to implement our business plan or, if implemented, will be successful. If our business plan is not successful, and we are not able to operate profitably, investors may lose their entire investment in our Company.
 
Through December 31, 2016, we have incurred $877,553 in losses since our inception. We have not achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur net losses throughout the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 and, probably, into subsequent fiscal periods.
 
Shell Company Status
 
Following our decision to terminate the metals streaming business and to return the remaining Proceeds to the Investors in March 2014, we currently have nominal operations and minimal assets. As such, we are considered to be a shell company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Accordingly, the securities sold in previous offerings can only be resold through (i) registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), (ii) Section 4(1) of the Securities Act, if available, for non-affiliates, or (iii) by meeting the conditions of Rule 144(i) of the Securities Act.
Current Business Plan
 
On December 28, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Merger Sub and Environmental Packaging Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“EPT”). See Business – Recent Developments
 
We are not currently engaged in any substantive business activity except the search for potential assets, property or businesses to acquire, and we have no current plans to engage in any other activity in the foreseeable future unless and until we complete any such acquisition. In our present form, we are deemed to be a shell company seeking to acquire or merge with a business or company. We do not intend to restrict our search for business opportunities to any particular business or industry, and the areas in which we will seek out business opportunities or acquisitions, reorganizations or mergers may include all lawful businesses. We recognize that the number of suitable potential business ventures that may be available to us may be extremely limited, and may be restricted as to acquisitions, reorganizations and mergers with businesses or entities that desire to avoid what such entities may deem to be the adverse factors related to an initial public offering as a method of "going public." The most prevalent of these factors include substantial time requirements, legal and accounting costs, the inability to obtain an underwriter who is willing to publicly offer and sell securities on behalf of the particular issuer, the lack of or the inability to obtain the required financial statements for such an undertaking, state limitations on the amount of dilution to public investors in comparison to the shareholders of any such entities, along with other conditions or requirements imposed by various federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations and federal and state agencies that implement them.
 
If the merger with EPT is not completed, during the next 12 months, our only foreseeable cash requirements will relate to the payment of our SEC reporting filing expenses, including associated legal and accounting fees; costs incident to reviewing or investigating any potential business venture; and maintaining our good standing as a corporation in our state of organization. We anticipate that these funds will be provided to us in the form of loans from our present management. There are no written agreements requiring our management to provide these cash resources.
 
Competition
 
Management believes that there are literally thousands of shell companies engaged in endeavors similar to those engaged in by the Company; many of these companies have substantial current assets and cash reserves. Competitors also include thousands of other publicly-held companies whose business operations have proven unsuccessful, and whose only viable business opportunity is that of providing a publicly-held vehicle through which a private entity may have access to the public capital markets via a reverse reorganization or merger. There is no reasonable way to predict our competitive position or that of any other entity in these endeavors; however, we, having limited assets and no cash reserves, will no doubt be at a competitive disadvantage in competing with entities that have significant cash resources and have recent operating histories when compared with the lack of any substantive operations by the Company.

Government Regulations
 
Smaller Reporting Company
 
We are a "smaller reporting company," which designation relieves us of some of the informational requirements of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities Exchange Commission ("SEC").
 
Sarbanes/Oxley Act
 
We are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or "SOX Act." The SOX Act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthens auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members' appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of public companies' auditors; management assessment of our internal controls; auditor attestation to management's conclusions about internal controls; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; requires companies and auditors to evaluate internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the requirements of the SOX Act will substantially increase our legal and accounting costs.
 
Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or "JOBS Act." As long as we remain an "emerging growth company," we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not an "emerging growth company," like those applicable to a "smaller reporting company," including, but not limited to, a scaled down description of our business in SEC filings; no requirements to include risk factors in Exchange Act filings; no requirement to include certain selected financial data and supplementary financial information in SEC filings; not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements that we file under the Exchange Act; no requirement for the SOX Act Section 404(b) auditor attestations of internal control over financial reporting; and exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and seeking nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We are also only required to file audited financial statements for the previous two fiscal years when filing registration statements, together with reviewed financial statements of any applicable subsequent quarter.
 
We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an "emerging growth company." We can remain an "emerging growth company" for up to five years. We would cease to be an "emerging growth company" prior to such time if we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more and when we become a "larger accelerated filer," have a public float of $700 million or more or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.
 
Employees
 
At present, Michael Hlavsa is our sole officer and director. Mr. Hlavsa works on a part-time basis and devotes approximately 5% of his time to our operation. He does not have an employment agreement with us.
