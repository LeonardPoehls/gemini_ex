Item 1. Business
Business Overview
FCB Financial Holdings, Inc. is a bank holding company, headquartered in Weston, Florida, with one wholly-owned national bank subsidiary, Florida Community Bank, National Association. We provide a range of financial products and services to individuals, small and medium-sized businesses, some large businesses, and other local organizations and entities through 46 branches in south and central Florida. We target retail customers and commercial customers who are engaged in a wide variety of industries including healthcare and professional services; retail and wholesale trade; tourism; agricultural services; manufacturing; distribution and distribution-related industries; technology; automotive; aviation; food products; building materials; residential housing; and commercial real estate. 
Since our formation in April 2009, we have raised equity capital and acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of eight failed banks from the FDIC, as receiver. In January 2014, we acquired Great Florida Bank, which, combined with the acquisitions of the eight failed banks, are collectively referred to as the “Acquisitions”. Through the integration of the operations and systems of the acquired banks, we have transformed into a large, integrated commercial bank. Subsequent to the Acquisitions, we have focused on internal growth. From the Acquisitions and our internal growth, our consolidated total assets, total deposits and total stockholders’ equity were $9.09 billion, $7.31 billion and $982.4 million at December 31, 2016.
Acquisitions
Old Failed Bank Acquisitions
In six of the eight Old Failed Bank acquisitions, we entered into loss sharing agreements with the FDIC under which the FDIC would bear a substantial portion of the risk of loss. In general, the FDIC agreed to assume 80% of losses and share 80% of loss recoveries on the first agreed-upon portion of losses on the acquired loans and OREO. 
On March 4, 2015, the Bank entered into agreements with the FDIC that terminated all six of the then existing loss share agreements with the FDIC, and made a payment of $14.8 million to the FDIC as consideration for the early termination of such loss share agreements. All rights and obligations of the Bank under the loss share agreements, including the clawback provisions, were eliminated under the early termination agreements. As a consequence of the early termination of the loss share agreements, future projected amortization expense of the indemnification asset was eliminated. Further, early termination of the loss share agreements resulted in a one-time expense of approximately $40.3 million on a tax effected basis, or $65.5 million on a pre-tax basis.
Great Florida Bank Acquisition
On January 31, 2014, we paid $14.1 million in cash, net of cash acquired, in connection with the acquisition of Great Florida Bank, a state chartered commercial bank, headquartered in Miami Lakes, Florida. The primary reasons for the transaction were to enhance stockholder value and to further expand our existing branch network. Great Florida Bank had total assets of $957.3 million and total liabilities of $962.2 million at fair value as of January 31, 2014. Holders of Great Florida Bank common stock received $3.24 per share in cash for each common share owned resulting in a total cash purchase price of $42.5 million. The acquisition of Great Florida Bank added to our branch network 25 banking locations within Southeast Florida and the Miami metropolitan area. The Company invested $125 million in the Bank at the time of the Great Florida Bank transaction. None of the assets acquired in the Great Florida Acquisition were covered by loss sharing agreements.
The transaction added approximately $864.0 million in deposits, $548.1 million in loans and $47.4 million in goodwill to our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our Consolidated Income Statement includes the impact of business activity associated with the Great Florida Bank acquisition subsequent to January 31, 2014.

Competition
The banking business is highly competitive, and we experience competition in our markets from many other financial institutions. Competition among financial institutions is based upon interest rates offered on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans, other credit and service charges relating to loans, the quality and scope of the services offered, the convenience of banking facilities, reputation in the community and, in the case of loans to commercial borrowers, relative lending limits. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds, as well as super-regional, national and international financial institutions that operate offices within our market areas and beyond. Our largest banking competitors in our markets include Bank of America, BankUnited, BB&T, JPMorgan Chase, Regions Bank, SunTrust Bank, TD Bank and Wells Fargo.
Our top five market areas include the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach MSA, Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island, FL MSA, Cape Coral-Fort Myers, FL MSA, North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, FL MSA and Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, FL MSA of which we held 1.47%, 3.55%, 3.05%, 2.12% and 0.98%, respectively, of the deposit market share as of June 30, 2016. Overall, in the Florida marketplace, the Company ranks 13th in total deposits according to SNL Financial.
We believe that the Bank’s operation as a Florida-based regional bank with a broad base of local customers, as well as the local relationships of the Bank’s senior management team and existing and future relationship-oriented lending officers, enhances our 
5

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, some of which are described below. Applicable laws and regulations restrict our permissible activities and investments and, among other things, require compliance with protections for loan and deposit customers; impose capital adequacy requirements; and restrict our ability to receive dividends from our bank subsidiary. In addition, we are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by, among other regulatory bodies, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) which result in examination reports that can impact the conduct and growth of our business. The consequences of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations can include substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions.
FCB Financial Holdings, Inc. as a Bank Holding Company
As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or BHCA, and to inspection, examination, supervision and enforcement by the Federal Reserve. Federal Reserve jurisdiction also extends to any company that is directly or indirectly controlled by a bank holding company, such as subsidiaries and other companies in which the bank holding company makes a controlling investment.
Statutes, regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services, acquire depository institutions, and make distributions or pay dividends on our equity securities. They may also require us to provide financial support to any bank which we control, maintain capital balances in excess of those desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of the Bank or any other future depository institution subsidiary.
The Bank as a National Bank
The Bank is a national bank and is subject to supervision and regular examination by its primary banking regulator, the OCC. The Bank’s deposits are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) up to applicable limits in the manner and to the extent provided by law. The Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, or FDI Act, and FDIC regulations relating to deposit insurance and may also be subject to supervision and examination by the FDIC under certain circumstances.
The Bank and, with respect to certain provisions, the Company, is also subject to an Order of the FDIC, dated January 22, 2010 (referred to as the “Order”), issued in connection with the FDIC’s approval of the Bank’s application for federal deposit insurance. The Order requires, among other things, that the Bank, the Company, our founders and certain of our stockholders comply with all applicable provisions of the FDIC’s Statement of Policy on Qualifications for Failed Bank Acquisitions (“SOP”) and that the Bank to maintain capital levels sufficient to be well capitalized under regulatory standards during the remaining period of ownership of the investors (as defined in the Order) subject to the SOP. A failure by the Bank or the Company to comply with the requirements the Order could prevent us from executing our business strategy and materially and adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Our regulatory capital ratios and those of the Bank are in excess of the levels established for well capitalized institutions.

Regulatory Notice and Approval Requirements
A bank holding company must obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve in connection with any acquisition that results in the bank holding company owning or controlling more than 5% of any class of voting securities of a bank or another bank holding company. In acting on such applications, the Federal Reserve considers:

• | The effect of the acquisition on competition;


• | The financial condition and future prospects of the applicant and the banks involved;


• | The managerial resources of the applicant and the banks involved;


• | The convenience and needs of the community, including the record of performance under the Community Reinvestment Act; and


• | The effectiveness of the applicant in combating money laundering activities.

Our ability to make investments in depository institutions will depend on our ability to obtain approval of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve could deny our application based on the criteria above or other considerations, including the condition or regulatory status of the Company, the Bank or any other future controlled depository institutions.
Federal and state laws impose additional notice, approval, and ongoing regulatory requirements on any stockholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution. These laws include the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act. Among other things, these laws require regulatory filings by a stockholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution. The determination whether an investor “controls” a depository institution is based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investment. As a general matter, a party is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the party owns or controls 25% or more of any class of voting securities. Subject to rebuttal, a party may be presumed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 10% or more of any class of voting securities. If a party’s ownership of the Company were to exceed certain thresholds, the investor could be deemed to “control” the Company for regulatory purposes. This could subject the investor to regulatory filings or other regulatory consequences.
Broad Supervision, Examination, and Enforcement Powers
A principal objective of the U.S. bank regulatory regime is to protect depositors by ensuring the financial safety and soundness of banks. To that end, the Federal Reserve and other bank regulators have broad regulatory, examination, and enforcement authority. Bank regulators regularly examine the operations of banks and bank holding companies. In addition, banks and bank holding companies are subject to periodic reporting requirements.
Bank regulators have various remedies available if they determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of a banking institution’s operations are unsatisfactory. Bank regulators may also take action if they determine that the banking institution or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation. Bank regulators have the power to, among other things:

• | Enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices;


• | Require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice;


• | Issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced;


• | Direct increases in capital;


• | Direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets;


• | Limit dividends and distributions;


• | Restrict growth;


• | Assess civil monetary penalties;


• | Remove officers and directors;


• | Terminate deposit insurance; and


• | Appoint a conservator or receiver.

Bank Holding Company as a Source of Strength
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or Dodd-Frank Act, and Federal Reserve policy require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to the banks that it controls. If a controlled bank is in financial distress, then the Federal Reserve could assert that the bank holding company must provide additional capital or financial support to the bank. If a controlled bank is undercapitalized, then the regulators could require the bank holding company to guarantee a capital restoration plan. Because we are a bank holding company, the Federal Reserve 
7

Index to Financial Statements

views us (and our consolidated assets) as a source of financial and managerial strength for the Bank. Under the source-of-strength requirements, in the future we could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank should it experience financial distress, including at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such assistance or would otherwise determine not to provide it.
In addition, if the Federal Reserve believes that a bank holding company’s activities, assets, or affiliates represent a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of a controlled bank, then the Federal Reserve could require the bank holding company to terminate the activities, liquidate the assets, or divest the affiliates. Bank regulators may require these and other actions in support of controlled banks even if such action is not in the best interests of the bank holding company or its stockholders.
We control the Bank, which is a national bank. Consequently, the OCC could order an assessment of us if the Bank’s capital were to become impaired. If we failed to pay the assessment within three months, the OCC could order the sale of our equity in the Bank to cover the deficiency.
In addition, capital loans by us or the Bank to any of our future subsidiary banks will be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In the event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
Permitted Activities and Investments of Bank Holding Companies
The BHCA generally prohibits a bank holding company from engaging in activities other than those determined by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999, or GLB Act, expanded the permissible activities of a bank holding company that qualifies as and elects to become a financial holding company. Under the regulations implementing the GLB Act, a financial holding company may engage in additional activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity. Those activities include, among other activities, certain insurance and securities activities. The Company has not elected to become a financial holding company.
FDIC Statement of Policy on Qualifications for Failed Bank Acquisitions
The FDIC approved our acquisition of Old Premier in 2010 pursuant to the Order. The Order requires that the Bank, the Company, the Company’s founders and each investor holding more than 5% of our Class A Common Stock and any other investor determined to be engaged in concerted action with other investors comply with the applicable provisions of the FDIC Policy. The FDIC Policy imposes restrictions and requirements on certain institutions and their investors, to the extent that those institutions seek to acquire a failed bank from the FDIC. Certain provisions of the FDIC Policy are summarized below, including those relating to higher capital requirements for the Bank and limitations on certain transfers by holders of equity securities. As the agency responsible for resolving failed banks, the FDIC has discretion to determine whether a party is qualified to bid on a failed institution. The FDIC adopted the FDIC Policy on August 26, 2009. The FDIC issued guidance under the FDIC Policy on January 6, 2010 and April 23, 2010.
For those institutions and investors to which it applies, the FDIC Policy imposes the following provisions, among others. First, the institution is required to maintain a ratio of Tier 1 common equity to total assets of at least 10% for a period of three years following its first FDIC-assisted transaction, and thereafter maintain a capital level sufficient to be well capitalized under regulatory standards during the remaining period of ownership of the investors subject to the FDIC Policy. The Bank is currently subject to the well capitalized requirement but is no longer subject to the 10% Tier 1 common equity ratio requirement. Second, investors subject to the FDIC Policy that collectively own 80% or more of two or more depository institutions are required to pledge to the FDIC their proportionate interests in each institution to indemnify the FDIC against any losses it incurs in connection with the failure of one of the institutions. Third, the institution is prohibited from extending credit to its investors subject to the FDIC Policy and to affiliates of such investors. Fourth, investors subject to the FDIC Policy may not employ ownership structures that use entities domiciled in bank secrecy jurisdictions. The FDIC has interpreted this prohibition to apply to a wide range of non-U.S. jurisdictions. In its guidance, the FDIC has required that non-U.S. investors subject to the FDIC Policy invest through a U.S. subsidiary and adhere to certain requirements related to record keeping and information sharing. Fifth, without FDIC approval, investors subject to the FDIC Policy are prohibited from selling or otherwise transferring their securities in the institution for a three-year period following the institution’s first acquisition of a failed bank from the FDIC following their acquisition of their securities. The FDIC could condition our acquisition of another failed bank on one or more of our existing or future stockholders agreeing to be bound by this three year prohibition on

transfers. The transfer restrictions in the FDIC Policy do not, however, apply to investors that are otherwise subject to the FDIC Policy and are open-ended investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act, issue redeemable securities, and allow investors to redeem on demand. Sixth, investors subject to the FDIC Policy may not employ complex and functionally opaque ownership structures to invest in institutions. Seventh, investors subject to the FDIC Policy that own 10% or more of the equity of a failed institution are not eligible to bid for that failed institution in an FDIC auction. Eighth, investors subject to the FDIC Policy may be required to provide information to the FDIC, such as with respect to the size of the capital fund or funds, their diversification, their return profiles, their marketing documents, their management teams, and their business models. Ninth, the FDIC Policy does not replace or substitute for otherwise applicable regulations or statutes.
Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements
Capital Requirements. Bank regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution’s financial soundness. FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. The final supervisory judgment on an institution’s capital adequacy is based on the regulator’s individualized assessment of numerous factors.
As a bank holding company, we are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the Federal Reserve. The Bank is also subject to similar capital adequacy requirements administered by the OCC, as well as the prompt corrective action framework discussed below.
As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions, the FDI Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator. The standards relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure and executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards.
In July 2013, the Company’s primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve, and the Bank’s primary federal regulator, the OCC, approved final rules (the “New Capital Rules”) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking institutions. The New Capital Rules generally implement the Basel Committee’s December 2010 final capital framework (referred to as Basel III) for strengthening international capital standards. The New Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries, including the Company and the Bank, as compared to the previous U.S. general Basel-I based risk-based capital rules. The New Capital Rules also revise requirements with respect to leverage. The New Capital Rules revise the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios. The New Capital Rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and replace the previous general risk-weighting approach, which was derived from the Basel Committee’s Basel I capital accords, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the “standardized approach” in the Basel Committee’s 2004 “Basel II” capital accords. In addition, the New Capital Rules implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the requirements of Section 939A to remove references to credit ratings from the federal bank regulators’ rules. The New Capital Rules became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain of their components and other provisions.
Among other matters, the New Capital Rules: (i) introduce a new capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (CET1) and related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. Under the New Capital Rules, for most banking institutions, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and Tier 2 capital includes unrealized gains on available-for-sale cumulative preferred stock and other equity holdings as well as subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to the New Capital Rules’ specific requirements.
Pursuant to the New Capital Rules, the minimum ratios as of January 1, 2015 are as follows:
Minimum Capital Ratios


• | 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;


• | 6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets;


• | 8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and

9

Index to Financial Statements


• | 4% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the “leverage ratio”).

The New Capital Rules also introduce a new “capital conservation buffer”, composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonus payments based on the amount of the shortfall. Thus, when fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, the Company and the Bank will be required to maintain such additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%.
The New Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions must be deducted from capital to the extent these investments exceed 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1.
In addition, under the previous Basel I-based general risk-based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (“AOCI”) items included in stockholders’ equity (for example, marks-to-market of securities held in the available-for-sale portfolio) under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) are reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Pursuant to the New Capital Rules, the effects of certain AOCI items are not excluded; however, banking institutions, such as the Company and the Bank, that are not advanced approaches banking institutions (defined below) may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. The Company and the Bank made the decision to elect the AOCI opt-out effective as of March 31, 2015 reporting period.
Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a 4-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will increase by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
The New Capital Rules prescribe a new standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the previous four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 150% for commercial real estate loans that do not meet certain new underwriting requirements and 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes. Furthermore, the New Capital Rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation.
We believe that, as of December 31, 2016, the Company and the Bank each met all capital adequacy requirements under the New Capital Rules, including the capital conservation buffer, on a fully phased-in basis as if such requirements were currently effective.
Although Basel III includes as a new international standard a minimum leverage ratio of 3%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures, the New Capital Rules apply the Basel III leverage ratio (referred to in the New Capital Rules as the “supplemental leverage ratio”) only to advanced approaches banking institutions (i.e., banking institutions having $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more of foreign exposures).
Liquidity Requirements: Historically, the regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, without required formulaic measures. The Basel III liquidity framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by institutions and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward would be required by regulation. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”), is designed to ensure that the banking institution maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the institution’s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking institutions over a one-year time horizon. These requirements may 
10

Index to Financial Statements

incentivize banking institutions to increase their holdings of securities that qualify as high-quality liquid assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source. In September 2014, the federal bank regulators issued final rules for implementing the LCR for advanced approaches banking institutions and a modified version of the LCR for bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets that are not advanced approach banking institutions, neither of which would apply to us or the Bank. The federal bank regulators have not yet proposed rules to implement the NSFR. In addition, in February 2014, the Federal Reserve adopted rules requiring bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced liquidity standards, including a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days. The liquidity buffer is in addition to the Federal bank regulators’ proposal on the LCR and described by the Federal Reserve as being “complementary” to that proposal.
Prompt Corrective Action: The FDI Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. A depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation.
Under this system, the federal bank regulators have established five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized, in which all depository institutions are placed. The federal bank regulators have also specified by regulation the relevant capital levels for each of the other categories. Under certain circumstances, a well capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category. Federal bank regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. A depository institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan. Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies, including: termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC; restrictions on certain business activities; and appointment of the FDIC as conservator or receiver. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized.
With respect to the Bank, the minimum ratios to be well capitalized are as follows:


• | 6.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;


• | 8.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets;


• | 10.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and


• | 5% leverage ratio.

Regulatory Limits on Dividends and Distributions
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from each of its subsidiaries. The ability of a bank to pay dividends and make other distributions, is limited by federal and state law. The specific limits depend on a number of factors, including the bank’s type of charter, recent earnings, recent dividends, level of capital, and regulatory status. The regulators are authorized, and under certain circumstances are required, to determine that the payment of dividends or other distributions by a bank would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit that payment. For example, under the National Bank Act, dividends by the Bank are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the Bank obtains the approval of the OCC. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of the Bank’s “undivided profits.”
The ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends and make other distributions can also be limited. A bank holding company is subject to minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements as summarized above. The Federal Reserve has authority to prohibit a bank holding company from paying dividends or making other distributions. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies. The policy statement provides that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. Accordingly, a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health, such as by borrowing. In addition, the New Capital

Rules impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends, including if a banking institution fails to maintain the applicable capital conservation buffer.
Bank holding companies with average total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion must conduct an annual stress test of capital and consolidated earnings and losses. Capital ratios reflected in required stress test calculations will most likely be an important factor considered by the Federal Reserve in evaluating payments of dividends or stock repurchases. 
Certain restrictive covenants in future debt instruments, if any, may also limit the Bank’s or our ability to make dividend payments.
Reserve Requirements
Pursuant to regulations of the Federal Reserve, all banks are required to maintain average daily reserves at mandated ratios against their transaction accounts. In addition, reserves must be maintained on certain non-personal time deposits. These reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in an account at a Federal Reserve Bank.
Volcker Rule
The Dodd-Frank Act significantly restricts the ability of a member of a depository institution holding company group to invest in or sponsor “covered funds” (as defined in the Volcker Rule), which may restrict our ability to hold certain securities, and broadly restricts such entities from engaging in “proprietary trading,” subject to limited exemptions. The Volcker Rule’s requirements relating to proprietary trading generally became effective in July 2015. In December 2014 the Federal Reserve extended the conformance period for investments in, and relationships with, covered funds (including non-conforming collateralized loan obligations) that were in place prior to December 31, 2013 until July 2016, which was subsequently further extended until July 2017.
Limits on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
Banks are subject to restrictions on their ability to conduct transactions with affiliates, including parent holding companies and other related parties. Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act imposes quantitative limits, qualitative requirements, and collateral requirements on certain transactions by a bank with, or for the benefit of, its affiliates. Transactions covered by Section 23A include loans, extensions of credit, investment in securities issued by an affiliate, and purchases of assets from an affiliate. Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act requires that most types of transactions by a bank with, or for the benefit of, an affiliate be on terms at least as favorable to the bank as if the transaction were conducted with an unaffiliated third party. The Federal Reserve’s Regulation W also defines and limits the transactions in which the Bank may engage with us or with other affiliates.
The Dodd-Frank Act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” to include credit exposures related to derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements, and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied. The definition of “affiliate” was expanded to include any investment fund to which we or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser. The ability of the Federal Reserve to grant exemptions from these restrictions is also narrowed by the Dodd-Frank Act, including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators.
The Federal Reserve’s Regulation O imposes restrictions and procedural requirements in connection with the extension of credit by a bank to its directors, executive officers, principal equity investors, and their related interests. All extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests must be on the same terms as, and subject to the same loan underwriting requirements as, loans to persons who are not insiders. In addition, Regulation O imposes lending limits on loans to insiders and their related interests and imposes, in certain circumstances, requirements for prior approval of the loans by the Bank’s board of directors.
General Assessment Fees
The OCC currently charges assessments to all national banks based upon the asset size of the bank. In addition to the general assessment fees, the OCC imposes surcharges on national banks with a supervisory composite rating of 3, 4 or 5 in its most recent safety and soundness examination. The general assessment fee is paid to the OCC on a semi-annual basis. The Dodd-Frank Act provides various agencies with the authority to assess additional supervision fees.

Deposit Insurance Assessments
FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, are required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. The amount of a particular institution’s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution’s risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. An institution’s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels, the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to its regulators and other risk measures.
The Dodd-Frank Act changed the deposit insurance assessment framework, primarily by basing assessments on an institution’s total assets less tangible equity (subject to risk-based adjustments that would further reduce the assessment base for custodial banks) rather than domestic deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act also eliminates the upper limit for the reserve ratio designated by the FDIC each year, increases the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits by September 30, 2020, and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.
On March 15, 2016, the FDIC adopted a rule in accordance with provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that requires large institutions to bear the burden of raising the Reserve Ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. Since the Reserve Ratio has reached 1.15%, the FDIC will collect assessment surcharges from large institutions, which are generally defined as those with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. Once the reserve ratio reaches 1.38%, small institutions will receive credits to offset their contribution to raising the Reserve Ratio to 1.35%
On April 26, 2016, the FDIC also adopted a rule amending small institution pricing for deposit insurance which became effective June 30, 2016. Effective July 1, 2016, the initial base assessment rates for all insured institutions were reduced from 5 to 35 basis points to 3 to 30 basis points. Total base assessment rates after possible adjustments were reduced from 2.5 to 45 basis points to 1.5 to 40 basis points.
Continued action by the FDIC to replenish the DIF as well as the changes contained in the Dodd-Frank Act may result in higher assessment rates, which would reduce our profitability or otherwise negatively impact our operations. In addition, we will face higher assessment rates if the Bank’s total consolidated assets reach $10 billion.
Depositor Preference
The FDI Act provides that, in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If we invest in or acquire an insured depository institution that fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including us, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution and priority over any of the Bank’s stockholders, including us, or our investors or creditors.
Federal Home Loan Bank System
The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta “FHLB”, which is one of the 12 regional FHLB’s composing the FHLB system. Each FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. Any advances from a FHLB must be secured by specified types of collateral, and all long-term advances may be obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance. As a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB of Atlanta.
Anti-Money Laundering Requirements
Under federal law, including the Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or Patriot Act, and the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act, financial institutions (including insured depository institutions, broker-dealers and certain other financial institutions) must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures, and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. Among other things, these laws are intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. Financial institutions are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and customer identification in their dealings with non-U.S. financial institutions and non-U.S. customers.

Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions, and law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institution’s compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications, including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions. The regulatory authorities have imposed “cease and desist” orders and civil money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations.
The Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of persons, organizations and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If we or the Bank find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we or the Bank must freeze or block such account or transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities.
Interstate Banking and Branching
Federal law permits an adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding company, with Federal Reserve approval, to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding company’s home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law. In addition, national banks and state banks with different home states are permitted to merge across state lines, with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, unless the home state of a participating banking institution passed legislation prior to June 1, 1997 that expressly prohibits interstate mergers. The Dodd-Frank Act permits a national bank or a state bank, with the approval of its regulator, to open a branch in any state if the law of the state in which the branch is to be located would permit the establishment of the branch if the bank were a bank chartered in that state. National banks, such as the Bank, may provide trust services in any state to the same extent as a trust company chartered by that state.
Privacy and Security
Federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by, among other provisions, requiring banks to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain rules with respect to the disclosure to third parties of consumer information. We have adopted and disseminated privacy policies pursuant to applicable law. Regulations adopted under federal law set standards for protecting the security, confidentiality and integrity of customer information, and require notice to regulators, and in some cases, to customers, in the event of security breaches. A number of states have adopted their own statutes concerning financial privacy and requiring notification of security breaches.
Consumer Laws and Regulations
Banks and other financial institutions are subject to numerous laws and regulations intended to protect consumers in transactions with banks. These laws include, among others:


• | Truth in Lending Act;


• | Truth in Savings Act;


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act;


• | Expedited Funds Availability Act;


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act;


• | Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act;


• | Fair Housing Act;


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act;


• | Fair Debt Collection Practices Act;


• | Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act;


• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act;


• | Right to Financial Privacy Act;


• | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act;


• | Laws regarding unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices; and


• | Usury laws

Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous, and in addition, to those listed above. These federal, state, and local laws mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions

must deal with customers and monitor account activity when taking deposits, making loans, or conducting other types of transactions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could give rise to substantial penalties, reputational damage, regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by state and local attorneys general, and civil or criminal liability. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the Bureau, which has broad authority to regulate consumer financial services and products provided by banks, such as the Bank, and various non-bank providers. It has authority to promulgate regulations and issue orders, guidance, policy statements, conduct examinations and bring enforcement actions. For example, the Bureau has adopted rules requiring creditors to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer’s ability to repay any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling. In general, banks with assets of $10 billion or less, such as the Bank, will be examined for consumer complaints by their primary bank regulator. The creation of the Bureau is likely to lead to enhanced and strengthened enforcement of consumer financial protection laws, even for banks not directly subject to its authority.
The Community Reinvestment Act
The Bank is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA. The CRA is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound bank operations. The regulators examine and assign each bank a public CRA rating. The CRA then requires bank regulators to take into account the bank’s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering an application by a bank to establish a branch or to conduct certain mergers or acquisitions. The Federal Reserve is required to consider the CRA records of bank holding company controlled banks when considering an application by the bank holding company to acquire a bank or thrift or to merge with another bank holding company.
When we apply for regulatory approval to make certain investments, such as to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or to merge with any other bank holding company, bank regulators will consider the CRA record of the target institution, the Bank and any future depository institution subsidiaries. An unsatisfactory CRA record could substantially delay approval or result in denial of an application. The regulatory agency’s assessment of the institution’s record is made available to the public. The OCC conducted its first CRA exam of the Bank in 2013, and the Bank received a “satisfactory” rating.
In addition, federal law requires the disclosure of agreements reached with community groups that relate to the CRA, and contains various other provisions designed to improve the delivery of financial services to consumers while maintaining an appropriate level of safety in the financial services industry.
