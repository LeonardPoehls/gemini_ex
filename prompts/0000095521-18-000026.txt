ITEM 1. BUSINESS
SUPERVALU INC., a Delaware corporation, was organized in 1925 as the successor to two wholesale grocery firms established in the 1870s. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to “Supervalu,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “ourselves” and the “Company” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relate to SUPERVALU INC. and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All dollar and share amounts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are in millions, except per share data and where otherwise noted. Our fiscal years end on the last Saturday of February and contain either 52 or 53 weeks. All references to fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended February 24, 2018, February 25, 2017 and February 27, 2016, respectively. Our business is classified into two reportable segments: Wholesale and Retail.
Company Background
Our core business is the distribution of grocery and other products and provision of logistics and professional service solutions to retailers across the United States. Our Wholesale segment includes a network of 28 distribution centers covering approximately 21 million square feet from which we supply a broad assortment of over 175 thousand stock-keeping units (“SKUs”) to retailers, including independent retailers operating diverse formats, regional and national chains, including our corporate-owned retail stores, and military commissaries. 
During fiscal 2018, we expanded our Wholesale capabilities and distribution network through the acquisition of Unified Grocers, Inc. (“Unified”) and Associated Grocers of Florida, Inc. (“AG Florida”). We now serve customers in nearly all U.S. states and internationally, including in the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Asia. 
Our Wholesale business provides several sources of value enabling our customers to better serve their consumers. Our value proposition includes scale efficiencies in procurement, logistics, and merchandising; a broad assortment of products, including an industry-leading portfolio of private brands, ethnic and specialty offerings; and a suite of professional services offerings.
The continuing operations of our Retail segment includes 114 stores under the three banners of Cub Foods, Shoppers Food & Pharmacy and Hornbacher’s. We believe our Retail banners have strong local and regional brand recognition in the markets in which they operate. Our Retail segment leverages our Wholesale value proposition to offer consumers a shopping experience that includes an assortment of products and services at competitive prices through a network of well-maintained stores.
Strategic Transformation
We initiated a strategic transformation in 2016 to become the wholesale supplier of choice for grocery retailers across the United States, while also executing initiatives to deliver long-term shareholder value. Our strategic transformation has impacted each of our segments, including at our leadership level where we have appointed new Wholesale leadership to grow our business and drive operational improvements and synergistic integrations of our acquired businesses and new Retail leadership 
3

to make fundamental changes and further align retail initiatives with our wholesale operations. We expect to continue to execute on our transformation and value-enhancing initiatives.
Sales from our Wholesale operations represent approximately 80 percent of our aggregate annual net sales from continuing operations for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, when considering the pro forma sales from the Unified and AG Florida businesses that we acquired during fiscal 2018. This compares to approximately 44% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
To achieve our strategic transformation, we have executed and continue to execute on four strategic pillars:

• | Grow our Core Wholesale Business


◦ | The addition of more than $5 billion in run-rate sales to grow our core Wholesale business to nearly $13 billion when annualizing the sales from Unified and AG Florida. These acquisitions plus the addition of significant new Wholesale customers, such as The Fresh Market, drove this growth in fiscal 2018.


◦ | We made strategic capital investments of approximately $135 in fiscal 2018 toward the purchase and improvement of distribution warehouses, including Harrisburg, PA and Joliet, IL, to support the growth of our Wholesale business including our Market Centre division that supplies specialty and ethnic foods and non-food products, to solidify our East coast distribution and to enable further growth in certain key markets.


• | Optimize our Asset Base


◦ | We entered into agreements to sell a majority of our Farm Fresh retail stores and pharmacy assets for a total of $53 in March 2018.


◦ | We announced that we are pursuing the sale of our corporately owned and operated retail operations of Shop n’ Save (based in St. Louis) and Shop ‘n Save East (with stores in West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia) in April 2018. These operations along with Farm Fresh are now reported in discontinued operations.


◦ | These three retail banners had generated combined losses in fiscal 2018 from operations and Adjusted EBITDA in each case prior to discontinued operations presentation, which previously included the impact of corporate and additional supply chain expense allocations, and other expense.


◦ | We sold our minority interest in an entity that operates multiple franchised Cub Foods stores in the Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota market in February 2018.


• | De-lever the Balance Sheet


◦ | We completed the sale of Save-A-Lot for $1.3 billion in December 2016, significantly reducing our debt, fundamentally improving our balance sheet, eliminating high levels of capital expenditures for retail operations, and increasing flexibility and resources available to execute our wholesale growth strategy.


◦ | We announced a sale leaseback transaction in April 2018 for eight of our distribution centers with expected gross proceeds of approximately $483 before costs and taxes which net proceeds will be used to further reduce outstanding debt and fundamentally improve our balance sheet.


• | Strategic and Opportunistic Mergers and Acquisitions


◦ | We expanded our Wholesale business and distribution network on the West Coast through the acquisition of Unified on June 23, 2017, a business that had $3.7 billion of annual net sales, including Market Centre.


◦ | We expanded our Wholesale business and distribution network in Florida through the acquisition of AG Florida on December 8, 2017, a business that had $0.6 billion in annual net sales, including international customers and specialty and ethnic foods to local wholesale customers.


◦ | We have increased our expected run-rate cost synergies to approximately $95 to be achieved by the end of third year following the respective closings of the Unified and AG Florida transactions, of which we realized approximately $23 in fiscal 2018.


◦ | We expect the food wholesale industry consolidation to continue and believe our strategy enables us to build upon the recent acquisitions of Unified and AG Florida to further grow and expand capabilities through merger and acquisition opportunities.

Wholesale
We organize and operate our Wholesale segment through three geographic regions: East, Central and West. In fiscal 2018, our Wholesale network supplied 48 states, shipped internationally, served as a primary grocery supplier to approximately 3,323 stores, and served as a secondary grocery supplier to approximately 2,462 stores. Our Wholesale customers include single and multiple independent grocery store operators, regional chains and the military, many of which are long tenured customers. The following charts depict the mix of our Wholesale customers and the tenure of our top 25 Wholesale customers by net sales:
4


(1) | Unified’s net sales include domestic and international net sales of Unified for the 35 weeks ended February 24, 2018. On a pro forma basis, Unified’s net sales would have been $3,715 if their sales results for the 16 weeks prior to the acquisition date had been included in our fiscal 2018 results.


(2) | AG Florida’s net sales include domestic and international net sales of AG Florida for the 11 weeks ended February 24, 2018. On a pro forma basis, AG Florida’s net sales would have been $644 if their sales results for the 41 weeks prior to the acquisition date had been included in our fiscal 2018 results.


(3) | The 20+ Years tenure percentage for the top 25 customers decreased in fiscal 2018 from 68 percent in fiscal 2017 primarily attributable to organic sales growth from two recently affiliated large customers.


(4) | Wholesale primary stores is defined as a customer location that has received over a certain dollar threshold of Wholesale product for each of the last three fiscal periods in a given quarter and purchases two or more product groups.

We have established a national network of strategically located distribution centers utilizing a multi-tiered logistics system. The network includes facilities that carry slow turn or fast turn groceries, perishables, general merchandise and home, health and beauty care products. As of February 24, 2018, the network was comprised of 28 distribution facilities, seven of which supply our own Retail stores in addition to stores of Wholesale customers. For financial reporting purposes, sales from our distribution centers to our own Retail stores are eliminated within the Wholesale segment. Deliveries to Retail stores are made from our distribution centers by our trucks, third-party independent trucking companies or customer-owned trucks.
We offer Wholesale customers a wide variety of food and non-food products, including national and regional brands, and our own extensive lines of private label products. We also offer a broad array of professional services that provide Wholesale customers with cost-effective and scalable solutions. These services include pass-through programs in which vendors provide services directly to our Wholesale customers, as well as services and solutions we develop and provide directly. Our services include retail store support, advertising, couponing, e-commerce, network and data hosting solutions, training and certifications classes, and administrative back-office solutions. The sales and operating results for these services are included within Wholesale.
As a logistics provider, efficiency is an important customer service measure. We optimize our facilities to implement leading warehouse technology, ranging from radio-frequency devices guiding selectors to mechanized facilities with completely automated order selection for dry groceries that help us deliver aisle-ready pallets to Wholesale customers. Our Wholesale segment also focuses on improving our supply chain to achieve labor and cost efficiencies.
The acquisitions of Unified and AG Florida have expanded our national supply network and distribution center footprint, as represented in the following map, which indicates the locations of our distribution centers, related wholesale primary stores and our own retail stores:

(1) | The above map approximates the total number of Wholesale primary stores we supply, and excludes certain international locations that do not classify as Wholesale primary stores.

Retail
We conduct the continuing operations of our Retail segment through a total of 114 stores, as of February 24, 2018, primarily organized under the three retail grocery banners of Cub Foods, Shoppers Food & Pharmacy, and Hornbacher’s. Our Retail stores provide an extensive grocery offering and, depending on size, a variety of additional products, including general merchandise, home, health and beauty care, and pharmacy. We offer national and regional brands as well as our own private label products. Depending on the banner, a typical Retail store carries approximately 16,000 to 21,000 core SKUs and ranges in size from approximately 50,000 to 70,000 square feet.
We believe our Retail banners have strong local and regional brand recognition in the markets in which they operate. Our Retail continuing operations are supplied by seven distribution centers that are part of the Wholesale segment providing wholesale distribution to both our own Retail stores and stores of Wholesale customers.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we announced the exit of our Farm Fresh banner and that we are pursuing the sale of certain of our corporately owned and operated retail operations consisting of Shop ‘n Save in the St. Louis, Missouri area (“Shop ‘n Save”) and our Shop ‘n Save stores located in Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia (“Shop ‘n Save East”). These retail assets have been classified as held for sale and the historical results of operations, financial position and cash flows directly attributable to these operations are reported within discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K references to the Retail segment exclude these retail assets that are held for sale. 
Sale of Save-A-Lot
On December 5, 2016, we completed the sale of Save-A-Lot to SAL Acquisition Corp (f/k/a Smith Acquisition Corp), an affiliate of Onex Partners Managers LP, for a purchase price of approximately $1.3 billion in cash. The sale of Save-A-Lot was completed pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 16, 2016 (“SAL Merger Agreement”), by and among SAL Acquisition Corp, SAL Merger Sub Corp (f/k/a Smith Merger Sub Corp), a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the SAL Acquisition Corp, Supervalu and Moran Foods, LLC (“Moran Foods”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Supervalu prior to the sale. Concurrently with entering into the SAL Merger Agreement, Supervalu and Moran Foods also entered into a Separation Agreement (the “Separation Agreement”) pursuant to which, among other things, the assets and liabilities of the Save-A-Lot business were transferred to and assumed by Moran Foods prior to the completion of the sale. The assets, liabilities, operating results, and cash flows of the Save-A-Lot business are reported within discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented.

Corporate
In connection with the sale of Save-A-Lot on December 5, 2016, Supervalu and Moran Foods entered into a Services Agreement, pursuant to which we provide certain technical, human resources, finance and other operational services to Save-A-Lot for a term of five years, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein. The initial annual base charge under the Services Agreement is $30, subject to adjustments. 
We provide back-office administrative support services under the transition services agreements (“TSA”) with New Albertson’s, Inc. (“NAI”) and Albertson’s LLC (“Albertson’s”) and also provide services as needed to transition and wind down the TSA with NAI and Albertson’s. We anticipate our services to NAI and Albertson’s and our revenue under the TSA will end in September 2018, subject to limited extensions of services at NAI’s and Albertson’s election.
Products
We offer a wide variety of nationally advertised brand name and private-label products, including grocery (both perishable and nonperishable), general merchandise, home, health and beauty care, and pharmacy, which are sold through our Wholesale segment to Wholesale customers and through Supervalu-operated Retail stores to shoppers. We believe that we have adequate and alternative sources of supply for most of our purchased products.

Private-Label Products
Our private-label products are produced to our specification by many suppliers and compete in most categories. Private-label products include: the premium brands CULINARY CIRCLE® and STOCKMAN AND DAKOTA®, which offer unique, premium quality products in highly competitive categories; WILD HARVEST®, which is free from over 140 undesirable ingredients; core brands ESSENTIAL EVERYDAY®, EQUALINE®, SPRINGFIELD®, and category-specific brands ARCTIC SHORES SEAFOOD COMPANY®, BABY BASICS®, FARM STAND®, STONE RIDGE CREAMERY®, GOLDEN CRÈME® and SUPER CHILL®, which provide shoppers quality national brand equivalent products at a competitive price; and the value brands SHOPPER’S VALUE® and SPECIAL VALUE®, which offer budget conscious consumers quality alternatives to national brands at substantial savings. 
7

Trademarks
We offer Wholesale customers the opportunity to franchise a concept or license a service mark. These programs help our Wholesale customers compete by providing, as part of the franchise or license program, a complete business concept, group advertising, private-label products and other benefits. We are the franchisor or licensor of certain banner store service marks such as CUB FOODS®, FESTIVAL FOODS®, SENTRY, COUNTY MARKET®, NEWMARKET®, FOODLAND®, JUBILEE® and SUPERVALU®. Additionally, we added SPRINGFIELD, GOLDEN CRÈME and SPECIAL VALUE banner service marks through the acquisition of Unified. In conjunction with our licensing and franchise arrangements, we maintain wholesale distribution agreements with our licensees and franchisees, primarily under the CUB FOODS®, FESTIVAL FOODS®, SENTRY® and RAINBOW FOODS® banners.
We file a substantial number of our trademarks/service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, including for many of our private-label product brands. U.S. trademark and service mark registrations are for a term of ten years, and renewable every ten years as long as the trademark or service mark is used in the regular course of trade. We consider certain of our trademarks and service marks to be of material importance to our Wholesale and Retail segments and actively defend and enforce such trademarks and service marks. Solely for convenience, our trademarks, service marks or tradenames may appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K without the corresponding ® or TM symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate in any way that we will not assert, to the fullest extent, our rights to such trademarks, service marks and tradenames.
Working Capital
Normal operating fluctuations in working capital balances can result in changes to cash flow from operations presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows that are not necessarily indicative of long-term operating trends. Our working capital needs are generally greater during the months leading up to high sales periods, such as the time period from prior to Thanksgiving through December. We typically finance these working capital needs with funds provided by operating activities and short-term borrowings. Inventories are managed primarily through demand forecasting and replenishing depleted inventories. There are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital.
Seasonality and Reporting Periods
Overall product sales are fairly balanced throughout the year, although demand for certain products of a seasonal nature may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or other annual events. Our first quarter consists of 16 weeks, while all of our other quarters consist of 12 weeks, and all of our quarters typically include a major holiday.
Competition
Our Wholesale and Retail segments each operate in highly competitive environments. 
Wholesale competes directly with a number of traditional and specialty grocery wholesalers and retailers that maintain or develop self-distribution systems. We compete in this business on the basis of price, quality, assortment, schedule and reliability of deliveries and services, service fees and distribution facility locations.
We believe that our success is dependent upon the ability of the stores of our Wholesale customers, as well as our own stores, to compete successfully. We also compete to attract and maintain licensed and franchised operators to operate stores to which we provide wholesale distribution and services. This competition generally takes the form of alternative investment formats, such as a potential or existing licensee’s investment in fast food restaurants, dollar stores, specialty supermarkets, drug stores and other potential investments.
Principal competition for our Retail segment, as well as for our Wholesale customers, comes from traditional grocery retailers, including regional and national chains and independent grocery store operators, and non-traditional retailers, such as supercenters, membership warehouse clubs, specialty supermarkets, hard discount stores, dollar stores, online retailers, convenience stores, drug stores and restaurants. Our ability to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and create an attractive value proposition for our customers is dependent upon a combination of price, quality, customer service, convenience, e-commerce offerings, assortment, in-stock levels, brand perception, store location and conditions, in-store marketing and merchandising and promotional strategies. 
Recent and ongoing consolidation within the grocery industry has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, increased competition, including from some competitors that have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us.

Employees
As of February 24, 2018, we had approximately 31,000 employees. Of our 31,000 employees, 8,000 relate to our retail banners classified as held for sale in discontinued operations, of which approximately 3,000 employees were covered by seven collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 17,000 employees are covered by 63 collective bargaining agreements. During fiscal 2018, 23 collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 5,800 employees were renegotiated. As of February 24, 2018, four collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 600 employees had already expired without their terms being renegotiated. Negotiations are expected to continue with the bargaining units representing the employees subject to those expired agreements. During fiscal 2019, 15 collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 5,000 employees are scheduled to expire. The majority of employees covered by these expiring collective bargaining agreements are located in the Midwestern regions. We are focused on having competitive cost structures in each geographic region in which we operate while meeting our employees’ needs for attractive wages and affordable healthcare and retirement benefits. We believe we have generally good relations with our employees and with the labor unions that represent employees covered by collective bargaining agreements.
