Item 1. Business.
 
Vapetek is a company engaged in developing, marketing and selling electronic cigarettes (“e-cig”), e-liquids, rechargeable batteries and vapor devices in the emerging growth e-cigarette industry. The Company’s business product mix currently stands at approximately 25% e-liquids and 75% devices, which consist of e-cig, rechargeable batteries and vapor devices. Thus far the majority of our revenues have been from the sale of 3 products: the Vapetek Liquivape e-Liquid, Dripstix E-Liquid, 1100mAh and 1500mAh Vapetek Batteries. All of our products are U.S. pharmacopeia (USP) grade which means our e-liquids meet the product quality and standards set by The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, a non-profit organization that publishes food ingredients and dietary supplements. Food ingredients, flavorings and colorings, are reviewed by the USP and these standards are used by regulatory agencies and manufacturers to help ensure that these products are of appropriate identity, as well as strength, quality, purity and consistency. 

As of December 31, 2016 the Company’s executive offices were located at Huntington Beach, CA, at 5445 Oceanus Drive, Suite 102, Huntington Beach, CA, 92649.

Electronic Cigarette & Vapor Industry
 
Electronic cigarettes, or “e-cigs” as they are sometimes referred to, are a new addition to the market, in an early stage of development that has evolved rapidly over the past few years. The primary uses of electronic cigarettes include recreational use as well as smoking cessation devices. At the core of the device is its atomizer, a technology that heats a nicotine-infused propylene glycol liquid and then converts it into a vapor that users inhale through a plastic cartridge mouthpiece. The device is powered by a lithium-ion battery, which is rechargeable through a USB port, an AC wall outlet, a car adapter or a portable charging case.
 Electronic cigarettes were invented by Hon Lik, a Chinese pharmacist, who introduced it to the Chinese market in 2004 and expanded sales internationally in 2006. According to the FDA, there are more than 400 manufacturers of e-cigarette devices and components worldwide, the largest of which is Joyetech, a Chinese manufacturer.
 Electronic cigarettes represent a niche market, although it should be noted that the past few years have seen a significant rise in the number of market entrants. The global e-cigarette market CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) grew 57% between 2010 and 2012, and is currently north of Two Billion Dollars ($2,000,000,000).
 
The first-generation e-cigarettes led the initial growth of this exciting new industry, but it is the second and third generation of devices, that are now available, that are now growing the industry at a rapid rate. Known as vapor and tanks, or “e-vapor”, this sub-category of cigarettes, when coupled with the first-generation e-cigarettes, are expected to grow the market to over Ten Billion Dollars ($10,000,000,000) in sales by 2017. If everything continues as projected, then within the next decade the total sales from this e-cigarette market will surpass traditional cigarettes within the next decade.
 
When first launched, e-cigarettes were sold exclusively via online e-commerce channels. Over time online retailers turned to the brick-and-mortar model to allow consumers to experience the product first hand. At present, there are three primary methods in which e-cigarettes are sold. About 30% of all sales of e-cigarettes are sold through convenience stores, 26% are sold online, and 17% are sold through retail vape-shops.
 The leading players in this highly-fragmented market are Lorillard, the parent company to Blu (a leading e-cigarette company with roughly 40.2% of the domestic e-cigarette market), Joyetech, NJOY, Reynolds American and Altria. There are currently more than 250 different brands in the U.S. that offer e-cigarette products.
 Our Business
 
Vapetek is a technology company engaged in developing, marketing and selling electronic cigarettes (“e-cig”), e-liquids, rechargeable batteries and vapor devices in the emerging growth e-cigarette industry. The Company’s business product mix currently stands at approximately 25% e-liquids and 75% devices, which consist of e-cig, rechargeable batteries and vapor devices. Thus far the majority of our revenues have been from the sale of 3 products: the Vapetek Liquivape e-Liquid, Dripstix E-Liquid, 1100mAh and 1500mAh Vapetek Batteries
 All of our products are U.S. pharmacopeia (USP) grade which means our e-liquids meet the product quality and standards set by The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, a non-profit organization that publishes food ingredients and dietary supplements. Food ingredients, flavorings and colorings, are reviewed by the USP and these standards are used by regulatory agencies and manufacturers to help ensure that these products are of appropriate identity, as well as strength, quality, purity and consistency. 
 The Company has positioned itself as a technology company focused on the adoption of electronic vaporizing cigarettes (commonly known as “e-cigarettes”) by the world’s 1.2 Billion smokers. The Company provides high quality e-cigarette devices, electronic refillable and rechargeable atomizers and e-liquids offering a much safer alternative delivery system for nicotine. There are an estimated 300,000,000 people in the United States, with approximately 28% or 84,000,000 of the population classified as active cigarette smokers.

A key proposition of an e-cigarette is that it eliminates odor. One of the top reasons people ‘hate smokers’ is the smell of the burning cigarette. The Smoker smells bad, their clothes smell bad, and their breath smells bad, as well as the health issues associated with second hand smoke. The Electronic Cigarettes we are bringing to market deliver the nicotine through atomizing cartridges containing nicotine and water. This allows the Nicotine to be delivered through the lungs with Water Vapor, eliminating most all the health issues related to smoking a traditional cigarette (Examples include tar and over 4000 Carcinogenic Chemicals). The Electronic Cigarette also eliminates the smell, stink and ash associated with the burning of traditional cigarettes.
 
Currently the Company has customers both domestically and overseas in Japan and the United Kingdom   . It should be noted that the Company expects to continue developing domestic and international sales of its products in markets that it considers to be emerging for e-cigarette devices and products, such as in South America. As of this time we are researching potential targets in which to expand our reach, but we do not have concrete overseas expansion plans at this time.
*All of our current products are third party products created by third party manufacturers branded under our own trademark.
