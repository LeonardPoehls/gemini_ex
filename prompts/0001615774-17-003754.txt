Item 1. Business
Overview:
 
Calmare Therapeutics Incorporated (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware in 1971 as Competitive Technologies, Inc., succeeding an Illinois corporation incorporated in 1968. Effective August 20, 2014, the Company changed its name from Competitive Technologies, Inc. to Calmare Therapeutics Incorporated. The Company (collectively, “we,” “our,” or “us”), is a medical device company developing and commercializing innovative products and technologies for chronic neuropathic pain. The Company’s flagship medical device, the Calmare® Pain Therapy Device (the “Calmare Device”), is the world’s only non-invasive and non-addictive modality that can successfully treat chronic, neuropathic pain.
 
In 2007, the Company entered into an agreement (the “2007 Agreement”) with Giuseppe Marineo (“Marineo”) and Delta Research and Development (“Delta”), Mr. Marineo’s wholly-owned company, collectively (the “Parties”), that secured the exclusive, worldwide sales and distribution rights to the science behind Calmare Pain Mitigation Therapy™ (the “Technology”). Today, this science is effectuated by the Company’s flagship medical device – the Calmare Device. Sales of our Calmare Device continue to be the major source of revenue for the Company. In 2011, the Company’s 2007 agreement was amended (the “2011 Amendment”) to extend the exclusivity rights afforded to the Company by the 2007 Agreement through March 31, 2016.
 
In July 2012, the Company and the Parties worked on a five-year extension to the 2011 Agreement (the “2012 Amendment”). However, the Company believes that the 2012 Amendment is neither valid nor enforceable as it was never duly signed or authorized and subsequently deemed null and void. Therefore, the Company’s rights are determined by the 2011 Amendment which provides the Company with the exclusive rights to manufacture and sell the Calmare Device worldwide using the Technology. The Company is negotiating an extension to the 2007 Agreement. (see The Company’s Distribution Rights, Marineo and Delta under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and in Footnote 16, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES)
 
The Company has a majority-owned subsidiary, Vector Vision, Inc., which receives retained royalties from the Company’s previous business model, the licensing of patents.
 
The Company has incurred operating losses since fiscal 2006 and has a working capital and shareholders’ deficiency at December 31, 2016. We continue to seek revenue from increased sales of Calmare Devices as well as expansion of sales of the devices into new markets. At current reduced spending levels, the Company may not have sufficient cash flow to fund operations through 2018. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its developing other recurring revenue streams sufficient to cover operating costs. If necessary, we will meet anticipated operating cash requirements by further reducing costs, issuing debt or equity, and/or pursuing sales of certain assets and technologies while we continue to pursue increased sales of our Calmare Devices. The Company does not have any significant individual cash or capital requirements in the budget going forward. To return to and sustain profitability, we must increase our revenue through sales of our Calmare Devices and other products and services related to the Devices. Failure to develop a recurring revenue stream sufficient to cover operating expenses would negatively affect the Company’s financial position.

On September 3, 2010, the Company’s securities began trading on the OTCQB marketplace under the ticker symbol CTTC, having been delisted from the NYSE Amex (the “Exchange”). On October 5, 2010, the Company’s securities began trading on the OTC Market’s top tier, the OTCQX. Effective February 9, 2015, the Company’s securities began trading on the OTC Pink. Effective May 23, 2016, the Company’s securities were uplisted and began trading on the OTCQB. 
 
Revenue Generation
 
Revenue for 2016 was primarily from the sale of Calmare Devices to end users in the United States. It also includes rental income from situations where we rented Calmare Devices to end-users in the United States. A small percentage of revenue is derived from the sale of supplies and training, rental payments and the sale of rental assets. Additionally, the Company continues to receive a small amount of retained royalties as a result of the licensing of patents derived from the Company’s prior business model. These revenues are declining as the Company no longer actively licenses patents and existing licensing agreements are reaching the end of their term.
 
In 2010, the Company became its own distributor for the Calmare Device in the U.S, contracting with commissioned sales representatives to sell Devices from the Company’s inventory. During 2011 and 2012, the Company and its representatives developed plans to increase awareness of the Calmare Device among critical medical specialties. The Company implemented those plans by targeting specific customers and locations in 2012. Since then, the Company has entered into multiple sales agreements for the Calmare Device. Sales to physicians and medical practices and to others with whom the Company had existing sales agreements continue to generate revenue for the Company.
 
In June 15, 2010, the Company became a government contractor and was granted its first General Services Administration (“GSA”) contract (V797P-4300B) from the U.S. Veterans Administration (the “VA”) for Calmare Devices. In 2016 and 2015, we had a significant concentration of revenue from sales and rentals of our Calmare Device, specifically 96.6% of total revenue in 2016 and 92.2% of total revenue in 2015.
 
The Company has a device manufacturing agreement, (the “Manufacturing Agreement”), with GEOMC Co., Ltd. (“GEOMC”, formerly Daeyang E & C Co., Ltd.) of Seoul, South Korea, to manufacture the Calmare Device, as per the specification delineated in the Company’s Food and Drug Administration’s 510k clearance (#K081255). As per this “clearance,” the Company has the sole, irrevocable right to sell the Calmare Device in the United States and global reciprocity countries. The Manufacturing Agreement is in effect for a period of ten (10) years through 2017, subject to terms and conditions.
 
We record revenue from the sales of inventory when the terms of the sales arrangement are accepted by all parties including a fee that is fixed and determinable, delivery has occurred and our customer has taken title, and collectability is reasonably assured. We are the primary obligor, responsible for delivering devices as well as for training our customers in the proper use of the device. We deal directly with customers, setting pricing and providing training; work directly with the inventor of the technology to develop specifications and any changes thereto and to select and contract with manufacturing partners; and retain significant credit risk for amounts billed to customers. Therefore, all product sales are recorded following a gross revenue methodology.
 
Employees
 
We currently employ the full-time equivalent of seven (7) people. We also had independent consultants under contract to provide general and specific services specifically in (a) finance, (b) management, (c) medical device services, (d) business development, and (e) sales. In addition to the diverse technical, intellectual property, legal, financial, marketing and business expertise of our professional team, from time to time we rely on advice from outside specialists to fulfill other Company needs.
