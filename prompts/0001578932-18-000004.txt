ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
We are a Delaware limited partnership formed in February 2013 whose focus is on the production, marketing and distribution of methanol and anhydrous ammonia. Our production facility is strategically located on the U.S. Gulf Coast near Beaumont, Texas and commenced full operations during August 2012. Our facility has pipeline connections to adjacent customers, port access with dedicated methanol and ammonia import/export jetties, allowing us to ship both products along the Gulf Coast, and truck loading facilities for both methanol and ammonia.
We are currently one of the larger merchant methanol producers in the United States, with an annual methanol production design capacity of approximately 912,500 metric tons and an annual ammonia production design capacity of approximately 331,000 metric tons. 
Both methanol and ammonia are global commodities that are essential building blocks for numerous end-use products. Methanol is a liquid petrochemical that is used in a variety of industrial and energy-related applications. The primary use of methanol is to make other chemicals, with approximately 42% of global methanol demand being used to produce formaldehyde, acetic acid and a variety of other chemicals that form the foundation of a large number of chemical derivatives. These derivatives are used to produce a wide range of products, including adhesives for the lumber industry, plywood, particle board and laminates, resins to treat paper and plastic products, and also paint and varnish removers, solvents for the textile industry and polyester fibers for clothing and carpeting. Energy related applications consume approximately 29% of methanol demand. In recent years, there has been a strong demand for methanol in energy applications such as gasoline blending, biodiesel and as a feedstock in the production of dimethyl ether (“DME”), methyl tertiary-butyl ether (“MTBE”), particularly in China. Methanol blending in gasoline is currently not permitted in the United States. Methanol-to-olefins (“MTO”) consumes the remaining 29% of global methanol demand as the MTO segment in China has grown by approximately 44% from 2016 to 2017, causing China to become increasingly reliant on imported methanol. Ammonia, produced in anhydrous form (containing no water) from the reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen, constitutes the base feedstock for nearly all of the world’s nitrogen chemical production. In the United States, ammonia is primarily used as a feedstock to produce nitrogen fertilizers, such as urea and ammonium sulfate, and is also directly applied to soil as a fertilizer. In addition, ammonia is widely used in industrial applications, particularly in the Texas Gulf Coast market, including in the production of plastics, synthetic fibers, resins and numerous other chemical derivatives.
On December 6, 2016, OCIP received a proposal from OCI pursuant to which OCI would acquire the publicly held common units not already directly or indirectly owned by OCI in exchange for OCI shares at an exchange ratio of 0.5200 OCI shares for each common unit (the “Proposed Transaction”). On April 14, 2017, after negotiations with the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner regarding the Proposed Transaction reached an impasse, OCI informed representatives of the conflicts committee that no acceptable definitive agreement regarding the Proposed Transaction could be reached and terminated negotiations with the conflicts committee regarding the Proposed Transaction. 
On February 20, 2018, we announced that we had priced a proposed $455 million term loan B facility (the “New Term Loan”) and proposed $40 million revolving credit facility (the “New Revolving Credit Facility”). The proposed New Term Loan is expected to mature in 2025, and is expected to be priced at the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 425 basis points. We intend to use the expected net proceeds of the New Term Loan to repay in full our Term Loan B Credit Facility and to repay in full outstanding intercompany loans from OCI. The commitments in respect of the New Term Loan and New Revolving Credit Facility and the terms and conditions thereof (including the applicable interest rates) remain subject to the execution of definitive documentation with respect to the New Term Loan and New Revolving Credit Facility. The closing of the New Term Loan and New Revolving Credit Facility is expected to occur in March 2018 and is subject to customary closing conditions. Assuming our New Term Loan closes with an expected pricing of LIBOR plus 425 basis points, we expect a reduction of approximately $10 million per year of interest and principal payments on our New Term Loan based on the LIBOR as of March 5, 2018.

Our Facility
We purchase natural gas from third parties and process the natural gas into synthesis gas, which we then further process in the production of methanol and ammonia. We store and sell the processed methanol and ammonia to industrial and commercial customers for further processing or distribution.
Our integrated methanol and ammonia production facility is located on a 62-acre site south of Beaumont, Texas on the Neches River. We acquired our facility (which had been idled by the previous owners since 2004) in May 2011, commenced an upgrade that was completed in July 2012 and began operating our facility at full capacity in the fourth quarter of 2012. Our facility began ammonia production in December 2011 and began methanol production in July 2012, with revenues first generated from ammonia sales in the first quarter of 2012 and from methanol sales in the third quarter of 2012.
The following table sets forth our facility’s production capacity and storage capacity:

 | Annual Production DesignCapacity as ofDecember 31, 2017 | Production duringthe Year EndedDecember 31, 2017 | | Product StorageCapacity as ofDecember 31, 2017
Product | MetricTons/Day | MetricTons/Year (1) | | Metric Tons | Metric Tons
Methanol | 2,500 | | 912,500 | | 821,849 | 42,000 | (2 tanks)
Ammonia | 907 | | 331,000 | | 312,431 | 33,000 | (2 tanks)

_______________________________

(1) | Assumes facility operates 365 days per year.

Our facility is located on the Texas Gulf Coast, which provides us access and connectivity to our existing and prospective customers and to natural gas feedstock supplies. Our facility is connected to established infrastructure and transportation facilities, including pipeline connections to adjacent customers, port access with dedicated methanol and ammonia export barge docks and state-of-the-art methanol and ammonia truck loading facilities, which have improved delivery options for our customers. We own a 15-acre tract of land adjacent to our facility that provides us access to an ammonia pipeline and the flexibility to install a methanol and ammonia railcar loading facility. In addition, we also own a 19-acre tract of land adjacent to our facility that may serve as the future location of our administrative offices.
We have connections to one major interstate and three major intrastate natural gas pipelines that provide us access to significantly more natural gas supply than our facility requires and flexibility in sourcing our natural gas feedstock. Our facility is connected to natural gas pipelines owned by Kinder Morgan, Houston Pipe Line Company, Florida Gas Transmission and DCP Midstream Partners, LP. We are currently receiving our natural gas from Kinder Morgan and Houston Pipe Line Company though our direct pipeline connections with those companies, and from Enterprise Products through our direct pipeline connection with Florida Gas Transmission. Our facility is located in close proximity to many of our major customers, which allows us to deliver our products to those customers at competitive prices compared to overseas suppliers that are subject to significant transportation costs associated with transporting product to our markets.

Our Methanol Production Unit
Our methanol production unit is a 912,500 metric ton per year unit that is comprised of Foster-Wheeler-designed twin steam methane reformers for synthesis gas production, two Lurgi-designed parallel low-pressure, water-cooled reactors and four distillation columns. Our methanol production unit contains two methanol storage tanks with a combined storage capacity of 42,000 metric tons. In addition, our methanol production unit has a crude methanol surge tank, refined receiver tank, storage tank scrubber and crude tank scrubber. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our methanol production unit produced approximately 821,849 metric tons of methanol. We expect our methanol production unit to undergo an approximately four to five-week turnaround once approximately every four years. We executed a turnaround as part of our debottlenecking project that was completed in April 2015. We expect the next turnaround to occur in 2019. Please see below for a simplified process flow diagram.
9

Our Ammonia Production Unit
Our ammonia production unit is a 331,000 metric ton per year unit. The Haldor-Topsøe-designed ammonia synthesis loop at our facility processes hydrogen produced by our methanol production process as the feedstock to produce ammonia. Our ammonia production unit also uses hydrogen we purchase from third parties to supplement the hydrogen produced by our methanol production process. Our ammonia production unit contains two refrigerated ammonia storage tanks with a combined storage capacity of 33,000 metric tons. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our ammonia production unit produced approximately 312,431 metric tons of ammonia. We expect our ammonia production unit to undergo an approximately three to four-week turnaround once approximately every four years coinciding with the turnaround of our methanol production unit. We executed a turnaround as part of our debottlenecking project that was completed in April 2015 and we expect the next turnaround to occur in 2019. Please see below for a simplified process flow diagram.
10

Our Debottlenecking Project
As a means of maximizing our production efficiencies and reducing our energy consumption, we executed a debottlenecking project on our production facility that included a maintenance turnaround and environmental upgrades. This project increased our maximum annual methanol production capacity by 25% to approximately 912,500 metric tons and our maximum annual ammonia production capacity by 25% to approximately 331,000 metric tons. Beginning in January 2015, we shut down our methanol and ammonia production units for 82 and 71 days, respectively, in order to complete the debottlenecking project. We began start-up of the ammonia production facility on April 9, 2015 and reached daily ammonia production design capacity of 907 metric tons on May 5, 2015. We began start-up of the methanol production facility on April 22, 2015 and reached daily methanol production design capacity of 2,500 metric tons on May 23, 2015. The total cost of the debottlenecking project (including costs associated with a turnaround and environmental upgrades) was approximately $384.0 million (excluding capitalized interest). 
Our depreciation expense has increased from the additional assets placed into service from our debottlenecking project. In addition, due to the increase in our production capacity, our production volumes and cost of goods sold are greater in subsequent periods following the completion of the debottlenecking project than in prior periods. Thus, our results of operations for periods prior to and after the completion of our debottlenecking project may not be comparable. 
Feedstock Supply
The primary feedstock that we use to produce methanol and ammonia is natural gas. Operating at full capacity, our methanol and ammonia production units together require approximately 110,000 to 120,000 MMBtu per day of natural gas, as of December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, natural gas feedstock costs represented approximately 59% of our cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation). Accordingly, our profitability depends in large part on the price of our natural gas feedstock. Please read Item 7A—“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk” included in this report for additional information.
We have connections to one major interstate and three major intrastate natural gas pipelines that provide us access to significantly more natural gas supply than our facility requires and flexibility in sourcing our natural gas feedstock. Our facility is connected to natural gas pipelines owned by Kinder Morgan, Houston Pipe Line Company, Florida Gas Transmission and DCP Midstream Partners, LP. We are currently receiving our natural gas from Kinder Morgan and Houston Pipe Line Company though our direct pipeline connections with those companies, and from Enterprise Products through our direct pipeline connection with Florida Gas Transmission. We believe that we have ready access to an abundant supply of natural gas for the foreseeable future due to our location and connectivity to major natural gas pipelines.
We procure our hydrogen and nitrogen supply needs from Air Products LLC (“Air Products”) and Air Liquide Large Industries U.S. LP (“Air Liquide”), respectively. Our supply contract with Air Products provides for 31.0 MMscf per day of dedicated hydrogen and expires in 2021. The price we pay under the Air Products contract is linked to natural gas prices. Our supply contract with Air Liquide provides for up to 24.8 MMscf of dedicated nitrogen per day, expiring in 2024. The price we pay under our contract with Air Liquide is based on a combination of the cost of electric power, average gross hourly earnings and the latest value of the U.S. Bureau of Statistics Producer Price Index for Industrial Commodities.
Customers and Contracts
We generate our revenues from the sale of methanol and ammonia manufactured at our facility. We sell our products, primarily under contract, to industrial users and commercial traders for further processing or distribution. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we derived approximately 81% and 62%, respectively, of our revenues from the sale of our products to commercial traders for further processing or distribution and derived approximately 19% and 38%, respectively, of our revenues from the sale of our products to industrial users. In addition, we derive a portion of our revenues from uncontracted and contracted sales with our customers that have pricing terms based upon published spot prices. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we derived approximately 10% and 11%, respectively, of our revenues from spot price-based sales of ammonia. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we derived approximately 11% and 18%, respectively, of our revenues from spot price based sales of methanol. 
11

We currently are party to methanol sales contracts with several customers, including but not limited to Methanex Methanol Company, LLC (“Methanex”) and Southern Chemical Distribution, L.L.C. One of our customers is obligated to use best efforts to purchase a certain quantity of methanol from us each year, but generally our customers may determine not to purchase any more methanol from us at any time and may purchase methanol from other suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, our methanol sales contracts set our pricing terms to reflect a specified discount to a published monthly benchmark methanol price (Argus or Southern Chemical), and our methanol is sold on an Free on Board (“FOB”) basis when transported by barge, pipeline, and our methanol truck loading facility. For the year ended December 31, 2017, methanol sales contracts with Methanex and Southern Chemical Distribution, L.L.C., a subsidiary of Southern Chemical Corporation, accounted for approximately 40% and 14%, respectively, of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, methanol sales contracts with Methanex and Koch Methanol LLC accounted for approximately 35% and 24%, respectively, of our total revenues.
We are party to ammonia sales contracts with several customers, including but not limited to Interoceanic Corporation (“IOC”) and Lucite International, Inc. Our customers have no minimum volume purchase obligations under these contracts, may determine not to purchase any more ammonia from us at any time and may purchase ammonia from other suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, these contracts set our pricing terms to reflect a specified discount to a published monthly benchmark ammonia price (CFR Tampa), and our ammonia is sold on an FOB basis when transported by barge, pipeline and our ammonia truck loading facility. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, ammonia sales contracts with IOC accounted for approximately 8% and 14%, respectively, of our total revenues.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we delivered approximately 57% of our total sales by barge or vessel, 39% of our total sales by pipeline, and approximately 4% of our total sales through our ammonia and methanol truck loading facilities.
Quality Assurance
On December 20, 2016, we became ISO 9001 certified. ISO 9000 (which includes ISO 9001) is an international standard on quality assurance developed by the International Organization for Standardization. ISO 9001 certification indicates that a company has established and follows a rigorous set of requirements aimed at achieving customer satisfaction by preventing nonconformity in design, development, production, installation and servicing of products. 
Competition
The industries in which we operate are highly competitive. Methanol and ammonia are global commodities, and we compete with a number of domestic and foreign producers of methanol and ammonia. In addition, a long period of low natural gas prices in the United States has made it economical for companies to upgrade existing plants and initiate construction of new methanol and nitrogen projects. For example, Methanex and the Celanese-Mitsui joint venture have brought their new methanol facilities online in the last three years and Natgasoline, in which OCI indirectly owns a 50% interest, is currently in the construction phase on its 1.8 million metric ton methanol facility in Beaumont, Texas, and has stated that it expects to commence operations in the second quarter of 2018. In addition, Yuhuang Chemical and several other developers have announced plans to construct methanol plants in the U.S. Gulf Coast region over the next few years, which, if constructed, would increase overall U.S. production capacity and the availability of methanol supply to our customers from competing sources. There have also been significant ammonia capacity additions in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, including CF Industries' Donaldsonville plant and Dyno Nobel's ammonia plant in Louisiana. In addition, BASF/Yara have announced that they expect to commission an ammonia plant in Freeport, Texas in 2018. However, over the past few years, several methanol and ammonia projects have been canceled or delayed as a result of higher capital expenditure estimates than originally anticipated, among other reasons. 
While the methanol and ammonia industries are global in nature, we believe that our strategic location on the Texas Gulf Coast positions us as a key local supplier. Our proximity to customers and access to major infrastructure and transportation facilities, including pipeline connections to adjacent customers, port access with dedicated methanol and ammonia barge docks and state-of-the-art methanol and ammonia truck loading facilities provide us with a competitive advantage over other suppliers. 
The majority of methanol consumed in the U.S. Gulf Coast is imported from Trinidad and Tobago or produced domestically. During 2017, methanol sourced from Trinidad and Tobago accounted for approximately 49% of total imported methanol in the United States. Producers in Trinidad and Tobago have been facing significant natural gas feedstock shortages, thereby reducing the supply of all natural gas-based products from Trinidad and Tobago the United States. Furthermore, we believe that transportation and port-handling costs for imported methanol provide us with a cost advantage over foreign producers.
12

Similarly, the majority of ammonia consumed in our market is sourced overseas, particularly from Trinidad and Tobago, and is transported through the U.S. Gulf Coast. Our close proximity to our customers allows us to maintain a cost advantage over foreign producers that import ammonia into the U.S. Gulf Coast. During 2017, ammonia sourced from Trinidad and Tobago accounted for approximately 67% of total imported ammonia in the United States. Although ammonia sourced from Trinidad and Tobago historically enjoyed a competitive cost advantage, natural gas supply shortages and higher production costs in recent years have eroded this competitive advantage. Furthermore, we believe that transportation and port-handling costs for all imported ammonia provide us with a cost advantage over foreign producers.
Our major competitors in the methanol industry include Methanex, Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Southern Chemical Corporation and our major competitors in the ammonia industry include Koch Fertilizer, CF Industries and Nutrien (formerly Agrium and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc.). Based on 2017 data regarding total use of methanol and ammonia in the United States, we estimate that our production in 2017 represented approximately 14% and 2%, respectively, of total U.S. methanol and ammonia use.
Seasonality and Volatility
While most U.S. methanol is sold pursuant to long-term contracts based on market index pricing and fixed volumes, the market price of methanol can be volatile. Methanol is an internationally traded commodity chemical, and the methanol industry has historically been characterized by cycles of oversupply caused by either excess supply or reduced demand, resulting in lower prices and idling of capacity, followed by periods of shortage and rising prices as demand exceeds supply until increased prices lead to new plant investment or the restart of idled capacity. Methanol prices have historically been cyclical and sensitive to overall production capacity relative to demand, the price of feedstock (primarily natural gas or coal), energy prices and general economic conditions.
The seasonality of the U.S. ammonia business largely tracks the seasonality of the fertilizer business in the United States because the substantial majority of all domestic ammonia consumption in the United States is for fertilizer use. The fertilizer business is seasonal, based upon the planting, growing and harvesting cycles. Inventories must be accumulated to allow for customer shipments during the spring and fall fertilizer application seasons, which require significant storage capacity. The accumulation of inventory to be available for seasonal sales requires fertilizer producers to maintain significant working capital. This seasonality generally results in higher fertilizer prices during peak periods, with prices normally reaching their highest point in the spring, decreasing in the summer, and increasing again in the fall. Fertilizer products are sold both on the spot market for immediate delivery and under product prepayment contracts for future delivery at fixed prices. The terms of the product prepayment contracts, including the percentage of the purchase price paid as a down payment, can vary from season to season. Variations in the proportion of product sold through forward sales and variations in the terms of the product prepayment contracts can increase the seasonal volatility of fertilizer producers’ cash flows and cause changes in the patterns of seasonal volatility from year to year. Nitrogen fertilizer prices can also be volatile as a result of a number of other factors, including weather patterns, field conditions, quantities of fertilizers imported to the United States, current and projected grain inventories and prices and fluctuations in natural gas prices. In addition, governmental policies may directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted, the level of grain inventories, the mix of crops planted and crop prices, which would also affect nitrogen fertilizer prices.
13

Environmental Matters
Our business is subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local, environmental, health and safety regulations governing the emission and release of hazardous substances into the environment, the treatment and discharge of waste water and the storage, handling, use and transportation of our methanol and ammonia. These laws include the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”), the federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the Clean Water Act, or the “CWA”), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Toxic Substances Control Act and various other federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws, their underlying regulatory requirements and the enforcement thereof impact us by imposing:

• | restrictions on operations or the need to install enhanced or additional controls;


• | the need to obtain and comply with permits and authorizations;


• | liability for the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at current and former facilities and off-site waste disposal locations (if any); and 


• | specifications for the products we market.

Our operations require numerous permits and authorizations. Failure to comply with these permits or environmental laws generally could result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions, court orders to install pollution-control equipment, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental, health and safety laws may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment. We may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue. Private parties, including the owners of properties adjacent to other facilities where our wastes are taken for disposal, also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damage. In addition, the risk of accidental spills or releases could expose us to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The laws and regulations to which we are subject are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. The ultimate impact on our business of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that our operations may change over time and certain implementing regulations for laws, such as the CAA, have not yet been finalized, are under governmental or judicial review or are being revised. These laws and regulations could increase our capital, operating and compliance costs.
Our facility has experienced some level of regulatory scrutiny in the past, and we may be subject to further regulatory inspections, future requests for investigation or assertions of liability relating to environmental issues. In the future, we could incur material liabilities or costs related to environmental matters, and these environmental liabilities or costs (including fines or other sanctions) could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions.
14

The principal environmental regulations and risks associated with our business are outlined below.
The Federal Clean Air Act. The CAA and its implementing regulations, as well as the corresponding state laws and regulations that regulate emissions of pollutants into the air, affect us through the CAA’s permitting requirements and emission control requirements relating to specific air pollutants, as well as the requirement to maintain a risk management program to help prevent accidental releases of certain substances. Some or all of the standards promulgated pursuant to the CAA, or any future promulgations of standards, may require the installation of controls or changes to our facility in order to comply. If new controls or changes to operations are needed, the costs could be significant. In addition, failure to comply with the requirements of the CAA and its implementing regulations could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions.
The regulation of air emissions under the CAA requires that we obtain various construction and operating permits, including Title V and Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) air permits issued by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (the “TCEQ”). Requirements under these permits will cause us to incur capital expenditures for the installation of certain air pollution control devices at our operations. Various regulations specific to our operations have been implemented, such as National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants, New Source Performance Standards and New Source Review. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial capital expenditures to maintain compliance with these and other air emission regulations that have been promulgated or may be promulgated or revised in the future, including in connection with the projects discussed below under “—Material Estimated Capital Expenditures for Environmental Matters” that are designed to comply with our emission limits and requirements of our Title V CAA permit.
Release Reporting. The release of hazardous substances or extremely hazardous substances into the environment is subject to release reporting requirements under federal and state environmental laws, including the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. We occasionally experience minor releases of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances from our equipment. We report such releases to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), TCEQ and other relevant state and local agencies as required by applicable laws and regulations. If we fail to properly report a release, or if the release violates the law or our permits, it could cause us to become the subject of a governmental enforcement action or third-party claims. Government enforcement or third-party claims relating to releases of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances could result in significant expenditures and liability.
Clean Water Act. The CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into regulated waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters by a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Currently, legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions (including CO2, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of discussion or implementation. At the federal legislative level, Congress has previously considered legislation requiring a mandatory reduction of GHG emissions. Although Congressional passage of such legislation does not appear likely at this time, it could be adopted at a future date. It is also possible that Congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency.
15

In the absence of congressional legislation curbing GHG emissions, the EPA is moving ahead administratively under its CAA authority. In October 2009, the EPA finalized a rule requiring certain large emitters of GHGs to inventory and report their GHG emissions to the EPA. In accordance with the rule, we monitor our GHG emissions from our facility and have reported the emissions to the EPA annually beginning in September 2011. On December 7, 2009, the EPA finalized its “endangerment finding” that GHG emissions, including CO2, pose a threat to human health and welfare. The finding allows the EPA to regulate GHG emissions as air pollutants under the CAA. In May 2010, the EPA finalized the “Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule,” which establishes new GHG emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources, such as our facility, must obtain permits under the PSD and Title V programs of the CAA. The permitting requirements of the PSD program apply only to newly constructed or modified major sources. Obtaining a PSD or Title V permit requires a source to install best available control technology (“BACT”) for those regulated pollutants that are emitted in certain quantities. In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated that portion of the rule that would require facilities that only emitted GHG emissions (and not other regulated pollutants) in excess of specified thresholds to obtain PSD and Title V permits. Sources that emit other regulated pollutants in excess of specified thresholds that also trigger greenhouse gas emissions thresholds still must obtain a PSD permit for greenhouse gas emissions. Our debottlenecking project was a major modification for other pollutants, which required us to obtain a PSD permit for greenhouse gas emissions. We received our PSD permit from the EPA in August 2014. The TCEQ has since been authorized by the EPA to implement a greenhouse gas permitting program. 
The implementation of additional EPA regulations and/or the passage of federal or state climate change legislation will likely result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any GHG emissions program. Increased costs associated with compliance with any future legislation or regulation of GHG emissions, if it occurs, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions. In addition, climate change legislation and regulations may result in increased costs not only for our business but also for our customers that utilize our products, thereby potentially decreasing demand for our products. Decreased demand for our products may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions.
Further, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (“Paris Accord”). The Paris Accord entered into force in November 2016. The United States is one of over 70 countries that has ratified or otherwise indicated its intent to be bound by the agreement. To the extent the United States implements the Paris Accord in addition to the GHG regulations, it could have an adverse impact on our operations. However, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Accord and seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Accord on different terms or to establish a new framework agreement. The Paris Accord provides for a four-year exit process, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States' adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Accord or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. 
Environmental Remediation. Under CERCLA and related state laws, certain persons may be liable for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances. These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where a release or threatened release occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the release occurred and any persons who disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property. Liability under CERCLA is strict, retroactive and, under certain circumstances, joint and several, so that any responsible party may be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release of hazardous substances. As is the case with all companies engaged in similar industries, depending on the underlying facts and circumstances, we face potential exposure from future claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters, including soil and water contamination, personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances that we manufactured, handled, used, stored, transported, spilled, disposed of or released.

Government Assessments of Methanol. In September 2013, the EPA issued a final Toxicological Review of Methanol under its Integrated Risk Information System (“IRIS”). This review concluded that daily exposures to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) are “likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effectives during a lifetime”. This review did not address carcinogenicity, however, and the EPA has no plans at this time to conduct a Health Hazard Assessment under IRIS for cancer effects. The European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”) has recently adopted the report prepared by Poland in support of a proposal to restrict the sale of methanol to the general public and to limit its presence as an additive in consumer products. A decision on this proposal is currently pending before the European Commission, and action by the European Commission to restrict methanol sales and uses for certain markets and products could have a material adverse effect on our business. ECHA’s Committee for Risk Assessment declined to endorse a separate proposal from Italy and Holland to reclassify methanol as a Category 1B or Category 2 Reproductive Toxin on grounds of insufficient evidence, but it is possible that this proposal may be revisited in the future if new evidence becomes available.
Derivatives of Methanol-Formaldehyde. Methanol has many commercial uses, including as a building block to manufacture formaldehyde, among other chemicals. Formaldehyde is a component of resins used as wood adhesives and as a raw material for engineering plastics and a variety of other products, including elastomers, paints, building products, foams, polyurethane and automotive products. As discussed below, changes in environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or requirements relating to formaldehyde are being considered, and if adopted, could restrict formaldehyde uses and exposures, and as a result, could lead to a material adverse impact on our business by reducing the demand for methanol to manufacture formaldehyde.
Formaldehyde has been classified as a known human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and as a probable human carcinogen by the EPA. On July 7, 2010, President Obama signed the Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood Products Act into law. This legislation, which adds a Title VI to the Toxic Substances Control Act, establishes limits for formaldehyde emissions from composite wood products and requires the EPA to evaluate and establish limits for other types of wood products. In December 2016, the EPA finalized a regulation to implement this Act with two components: (1) formaldehyde emissions standards for hardwood plywood, medium-density fiberboard, particleboard, and finished goods containing these products that are sold, supplied, offered for sale, or manufactured (including imported) in the United States and (2) a third-party certification program to assure compliance by composite wood panel producers with the formaldehyde emissions limits established directly in the Act. This regulation was to become effective in December 2017, but the EPA has extended the compliance deadlines under the December 2016 rule to December 2018 and beyond. In addition, in December 2017, the EPA published a notice that it is withdrawing its direct final rule issued in October 2017 to update the voluntary consensus standards that were originally published in the December 2016 rule. The EPA had issued both a direct final rule and a proposed rule in October 2017. The EPA stated that, due to its receipt of adverse comments on the rule, it was required to withdraw the direct final rule and proceed with issuing a final rule only after it has considered all of the comments received. The comment period for submitting comments closed in November 2017. 
A risk assessment process for formaldehyde has been underway in the European Union for the past several years and has resulted in classification of formaldehyde as a category 1B carcinogen (“known to have carcinogenic potential for humans”) and a category 2 mutagen (“suspected of being toxic for human reproduction”). No decision has yet been made whether this classification will result in restrictions required under Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”), or in new classification, labeling and packing obligations; however, to support its decision-making, ECHA required an update by October 2017 of all Registrations for aqueous formaldehyde solutions containing methanol above 10% with information pertaining to various formaldehyde exposure scenarios, including from composite wood products. 
Derivatives of Methanol—MTBE. Changes in environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or requirements could also impact methanol demand for the production of MTBE. Several years ago, environmental concerns and legislative action related to gasoline leaking into water supplies from underground gasoline storage tanks in the United States resulted in the phase-out of MTBE as a gasoline additive in the United States. However, methanol is used in the United States to produce MTBE for export markets, where demand for MTBE has continued at strong levels. While we currently expect demand for methanol for use in MTBE production in the United States to remain steady or to decline slightly, it could decline materially if export demand is impacted by governmental legislation or policy changes. The EPA is currently reviewing the human health effects of MTBE, including its potential carcinogenicity. The European Union issued a final risk assessment report on MTBE in 2002 that permitted the continued use of MTBE, although several risk reduction measures relating to the storage and handling of fuels were recommended. Governmental efforts in recent years in some countries, primarily in the European Union and Latin America, to promote biofuels and alternative fuels through legislation or tax policy are also putting competitive pressures on the use of MTBE in gasoline in these countries. Declines in demand for methanol for use in MTBE production could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions.

Material Capital Expenditures for Environmental Matters. We incurred approximately $84.4 million in capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015, relating to the installation of a SCR unit for nitrogen oxide control; the installation of a saturator column system to improve plant efficiency, decrease nitrogen oxide emissions and decrease wastewater treatment from distillation; and the installation of a new flare to decrease carbon monoxide emissions during start-ups and shutdowns of our facility. These capital expenditures assist us in complying with federal, state and local environmental, health and safety regulations. None of the capital expenditures incurred during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, were related to environmental matters. 
On December 20, 2016, we became ISO 14001 certified. ISO 14000 (which includes ISO 14001) is an international standard on environmental management developed by the International Organization for Standardization that was developed to help organizations manage the environmental impacts of their processes, products and services. ISO 14001 defines an approach to setting and achieving environmental objectives and targets, within a structured management framework.
Safety, Health and Security Matters
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes, the purpose of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. We also are subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. These regulations apply to any process that involves a chemical at or above the specified thresholds or any process that involves flammable liquid or gas, pressurized tanks, caverns and wells in excess of 10,000 pounds at various locations. We also are subject to the EPA Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, known as the Risk Management Plan requirements, which are designed to prevent the accidental release of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive materials, and the U.S. Coast Guard’s Maritime Security Standards for Facilities, which are designed to regulate the security of high-risk maritime facilities.
On March 1, 2016, we achieved Star status in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (“VPP”). OSHA’s VPP is a program in which companies voluntarily participate that recognizes facilities for their exemplary safety and health programs. 
Employees
We are managed and operated by the board of directors and executive officers of OCI GP LLC, our general partner. Neither we nor our subsidiary have any employees. Our general partner has the sole responsibility for providing the employees and other personnel necessary to conduct our operations. All of the employees that conduct our business are employed by our general partner or its affiliates. Our general partner and its affiliates have approximately 114 employees performing services for our operations. We believe that our general partner and its affiliates have a satisfactory relationship with those employees.
Insurance
Our assets may experience physical damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations. We are currently insured under casualty, environmental, property and business interruption insurance policies. The property and business interruption insurance policies have a combined loss limit of $672.0 million which is placed in two layers. The primary layer has a loss limit of $392.0 million, with a deductible of $4.3 million for physical damage. The first excess layer of the property and business interruption insurance policy has a loss limit of $280.0 million for all risks coverage. Business interruption losses under the primary layer are subject to a time element 45-day equivalent deductible per occurrence. 
Our primary property policy provides coverage on an all risk basis and contains a number of sub-limits, such as a full primary limit of $382.0 million for losses due to business interruptions caused by machinery breakdown and a limit of $382.0 million for damage caused by a named windstorm, with a $41.0 million deductible per occurrence and a stand-alone named windstorm policy with a $10.0 million deductible, which reduces the primary deductible of $41.0 million. Our general liability insurance policies have a combined loss limit of $11.0 million per occurrence and $12.0 million for an annual aggregate. We are fully exposed to all losses in excess of the applicable limits and sub-limits of our policies. We are also exposed to losses due to business interruptions caused by machinery breakdown of fewer than 45 days per occurrence and losses due to property damage that are less than $4.3 million per occurrence. Because Hurricane Harvey did not cause any significant losses to our equipment or facilities, lost profitability resulting from the operational interruption of Hurricane Harvey was outside the scope of our insurance coverage.

With regard to environmental claims due to pollution, we currently have a policy limit of $25.0 million, and this policy has a deductible of $250,000. Our current construction floater policy contains a specific limit of $20.0 million for losses incurred during the construction of any equipment or facilities at our site. We continue to evaluate our policy limits and risk retentions as they relate to the overall cost and scope of our insurance program.
