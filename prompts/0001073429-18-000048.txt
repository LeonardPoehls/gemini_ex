Item 1.  Business
 U.S. Concrete, Inc. is a Delaware corporation founded and incorporated in 1997. We began operations in 1999, which is the year we completed our initial public offering.  In this report, we refer to U.S. Concrete, Inc. and its subsidiaries as "we," "us," "our," the "Company," or "U.S. Concrete," unless we specifically state otherwise, or the context or content indicates otherwise.
General
We are a leading producer of ready-mixed concrete in select geographic markets in the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We operate our business through two primary segments: ready-mixed concrete and aggregate products. Ready-mixed concrete is a highly versatile and widely used material in construction. This important building material is used in the vast majority of commercial, residential and public works construction projects. Aggregate products are granular raw materials essential in the production of ready-mixed concrete.
We serve substantially all segments of the construction industry in our select geographic markets. Our customers include contractors for commercial and industrial, residential, street and highway and other public works construction. Ready-mixed concrete product revenue by type of construction activity for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 56% commercial and industrial, 26% residential and 18% street, highway and other public works.
We operate principally in the Atlantic Region (which we define to include New York, New Jersey, Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania); Texas / Oklahoma; and Northern California with those markets representing approximately 38%, 36% and 25%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. We believe we are well positioned for strong growth in these attractive regions. According to estimates from the Portland Cement Association ("PCA"), the states in which we operate represented a total of approximately 29% of the 2017 consumption of ready-mixed concrete in the United States, which favorably positions us to capture additional market share in this fragmented industry. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.3 billion, of which we derived approximately 90.8% from our ready-mixed concrete segment, 3.7% from our aggregate products segment (excluding $40.9 million sold internally) and 5.5% from our other operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had net income attributable to U.S. Concrete of $25.5 million and income from continuing operations attributable to U.S. Concrete of $26.1 million. 
As of December 31, 2017, we operated 162 standard ready-mixed concrete plants, 17 volumetric ready-mixed concrete plants, 18 producing aggregates facilities, seven aggregates distribution terminals, two lime slurry facilities and one recycled aggregates facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, these plants and facilities produced approximately 9.0 million cubic yards of ready-mixed concrete and 6.3 million tons of aggregates. In addition, we leased two other aggregates facilities to third parties and retained a royalty on production from those facilities. As of December 31, 2017, we operated over 1,640 drum mixer trucks and 130 volumetric mixer trucks. For additional information related to our properties, see Item 2. Properties of this report.
2017 Key Acquisitions
Our revenue over the past five years has more than doubled, due in part to our acquisitions, which we have funded through existing cash balances, debt and equity. During 2017, we expanded our operations with the acquisitions of the assets of Corbett Aggregate Companies, LLC. ("Corbett") located in Quinton, New Jersey; Harbor Ready-Mix ("Harbor") located in Redwood City, California; A-1 Materials, Inc. ("A-1”) and L.C. Frey Company, Inc. ("Frey") (collectively “A-1/Frey”) located in San Carlos, California; and Action Supply Co., Inc. ("Action Supply") located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the outstanding common stock of Polaris Materials Corporation ("Polaris") located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. These acquisitions included approximately 130 million tons of proven aggregates reserves, seven ready-mix concrete plants and 51 mixer trucks, significantly enhancing our ability to serve construction projects in the Atlantic and West Coast markets.

Competitive strengths
Large, high quality asset base in attractive markets with favorable construction environments. Our assets are primarily focused in our Atlantic Region, Texas / Oklahoma, Northern California, British Columbia (which primarily supplies California) and the U.S. Virgin Islands markets. Our high quality asset base is comprised of 49 ready-mixed concrete plants, five aggregates facilities, five aggregates distribution terminals and one recycled aggregates facility in the Atlantic Region; 84 ready-mixed concrete plants, 17 volumetric ready-mixed concrete plants and 10 aggregates facilities in Texas / Oklahoma; 25 ready-mixed concrete plants and two aggregates distribution terminals in California; one aggregates facility in British Columbia; four ready-mixed concrete plants and two aggregates facilities in the U.S. Virgin Islands; as well as over 1,640 drum mixer trucks and 130 volumetric mixer trucks. We believe the scale and quality of our asset base, in addition to our product differentiation, on-time deliveries, competitive all-in delivered cost, service and reliability differentiate us and allow us to meet the needs of both large and small jobs for a wide range of clients in multiple end-use markets.
Growth in our Atlantic Region markets is driven by the financial services and government sectors; growth in our Texas / Oklahoma markets is largely driven by construction demand in the transportation, financial and other professional services and manufacturing sectors; and growth in our Northern California market is driven largely by the technology sector. In addition, each of these markets currently exhibit healthy residential trends supported by a number of factors, including population growth, decreases in unemployment, low mortgage and other interest rates, rising home prices and increasing construction activity. We believe that our better-than-average growth is driven by key industry sectors within our markets, which generally benefit from year-round construction.
Favorable exposure to commercial projects with higher margins. We bid for and routinely win supply contracts for some of the largest, most prestigious commercial projects. Some of the larger commercial projects we have worked on include:

• | Facebook NA-4 Data Center in Fort Worth, Texas


• | LaGuardia Airport in Queens, New York


• | Interstate 35W in Fort Worth, Texas


• | Google Bayview Campus in Mountain View, California


• | Toyota North American Headquarters in Plano, Texas


• | The Union Tower in Dallas, Texas


• | World Trade Center Complex in Manhattan, New York


• | Tappan Zee Bridge, New York


• | San Antonio Village in Mountain View, California


• | Hudson Yards Complex in Manhattan, New York


• | Museum of Modern Art Expansion Tower in Manhattan, New York

These types of projects have higher margins due to rigorous specifications, increased complexity, high customization requirements and significant volume capacity needs.
We provide alternative solutions for designers and contractors by offering value-added concrete products such as color-conditioned, fiber-reinforced, steel-reinforced and high-performance concrete. We believe this enhances our ability to compete for and win supply contracts for large, complex commercial projects that are difficult to supply.
Long-term customer relationships. Our management and sales personnel develop and maintain successful long-term relationships with our key customers. Customer concentration in our key markets allows us to better serve our new and existing customers with expedited delivery, lower transportation costs and scale efficiencies. Key elements of our customer-focused approach include:

• | corporate-level marketing and sales expertise;


• | technical service expertise to develop innovative new branded products; and


• | training programs that emphasize successful marketing and sales techniques that focus on the sale of high-margin concrete mix designs.

5

We estimate that the average length of our top 15 customer relationships is approximately 24 years, including periods prior to our ownership of acquired businesses. We further estimate that approximately 94% of our top 35 customers have relationships that extend past five years, with approximately 54% surpassing 20 years of loyalty. Our customer engagement model results in contractors returning year after year to us as a supplier they can trust. Despite our concentrated and loyal customer base, in 2017, no single customer or project accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. Our broad, yet targeted, customer base enables us to develop an efficient, stable business model and tap into the market in a variety of ways. We believe that by providing high quality, reliable services and customized products and solutions, we are able to maintain important long-term relationships.
Focus on environmental sustainability. We are a leader in the sustainable concrete market, and we expect domestic and global sustainable demand to continue to grow at attractive rates. We have an environmentally friendly concrete ("EF Technology") initiative that promotes green building and construction. Our EF Technology ready-mixed concrete products replace a portion of the traditional cement components with reclaimed fly ash, slag and other materials that results in lower carbon dioxide, or CO2, emissions. We believe this leads to an environmentally superior and sustainable alternative to traditional ready-mixed concrete for our customers’ consumption. We believe EF Technology reduces greenhouse gases and landfill space consumption and produces a highly durable product. Customers can also receive Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) credits for the use of this technology.
We believe our use of technology creates a competitive advantage over smaller concrete producers and larger vertically integrated aggregates and cement companies that do not focus on this as a first solution. We are positioned to take advantage of the growing demand for these products that could result in an increase in our revenue and profits and expansion of our operating margins, as these higher-priced value-added products are a lower cost alternative to cement. Today, we are a charter member of the Carbon Leadership Forum and the first ready-mixed concrete company in North America to adopt and receive verified Environmental Product Declarations for our concrete mixes, and we employ extensive sustainable operational practices across our enterprise. We are also a supporter of the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association ("NRMCA") Green-Star program, a plant-specific certification program that utilizes an environmental management system based on a model of continual improvement. Further, we participate in certain environmentally friendly governmental programs, as available. For instance, in the North Texas area, we participate in the Texas Emissions Reduction Program, in which we replace older engines of heavy-duty vehicles with newer models with more stringent federal emission standards.
Solid balance sheet and ample liquidity. We have successfully improved our financial performance by refocusing our financial objectives over the past several years. Our management team has extensive experience in the industry as does our board of directors. Our management team has focused on reducing our cost structure while expanding our existing and acquired businesses in our core operating regions to drive strong performance. As a result, we have grown revenue, improved profit margins and increased liquidity. We benefit from available liquidity through our revolving credit facility and cash flow from operations. We believe our solid balance sheet and ample liquidity will allow us to take advantage of strategic opportunities as well as provide ample cushion against general downturns in economic activity.
Experienced management team. Our senior management team consists of 13 executives with an average of 28 years of industry experience and is comprised of individuals with a proven track record in the construction materials industry. Our Chief Executive Officer, William J. Sandbrook, has over 25 years of construction materials industry experience. Our management team’s deep market knowledge enables us to effectively assess potential new opportunities to solidify our leading market presence. We will continue to focus on recruiting and retaining motivated and knowledgeable professional managers to continue to develop our business and maintain our leading market position.
Company strategy
Focus on core operations. We believe the best opportunities for future growth lie within our core ready-mixed concrete and aggregates businesses. We routinely evaluate our existing assets and business units to ensure we continue to maintain a best-in-class operation. We will continue to invest in our business, both in physical plants and new technologies, and we will continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities. We believe our focus on optimizing the performance of our ready-mixed concrete business will continue to differentiate us from our larger, integrated competitors that focus principally on their aggregates or cement and treat ready-mixed concrete operations as a downstream outlet for their aggregates or cement products.
6

Pursue growth. In addition to our general organic growth initiatives, we continuously evaluate both acquisition and partnership opportunities. We are focused on both strengthening our positions in existing markets as well as identifying attractive new markets. All of our acquisitions must meet our strict criteria, including fit with our strategic plan, investment return hurdles, capital requirements and attractive market attributes. During 2017, we completed eight acquisitions that expanded our footprint in the Atlantic and West Coast markets and facilitated vertical integration on the West Coast. We believe our significant experience, positive reputation and strong management team will allow us to continue our successful track record of identifying opportunities, integrating acquisitions, realizing synergies and enhancing asset value and cash flow.
Manage costs. We are continuously seeking opportunities to reduce costs and improve margins through our focus on existing operations and new technologies. Additionally, our regional acquisitions allow for synergies such as selling, general and administrative reductions, economies of scale, variable labor savings and increased purchasing power. We believe by aggressively managing our cost structure, we can best serve our clients with better pricing and continued best-in-class execution.
Business segments and products

We operate our business through two primary segments: ready-mixed concrete and aggregate products.  For financial information about our operating segments, refer to the information set forth in Note 17, "Segment Information," to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.  We derive our revenue from operations in the United States, its territories and Canada. All of our long-lived assets are located within the United States, its territories and Canada.
Ready-mixed concrete
General
Our ready-mixed concrete business engages principally in the formulation, preparation and delivery of ready-mixed concrete to our customers’ job sites. We provide our ready-mixed concrete from our operations in Texas, New York, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, California, Oklahoma and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Ready-mixed concrete is a highly versatile construction material that results from combining coarse and fine aggregates, such as gravel, crushed stone and sand, with water, various chemical admixtures and cement. We also provide services intended to reduce our customers’ overall construction costs by lowering the installed, or “in-place,” cost of concrete. These services include the formulation of mixtures for specific design uses, on-site and lab-based product quality control and customized delivery programs to meet our customers’ needs. We generally do not provide paving or other finishing services, which construction contractors or subcontractors typically perform.
Products and services
Our standard ready-mixed concrete products consist of proportioned mixes we produce and deliver in an unhardened plastic state for placement and shaping into designed forms at the job site. Selecting the optimum mix for a job entails determining not only the ingredients that will produce the desired permeability, strength, appearance and other properties of the concrete after it has hardened and cured, but also the ingredients necessary to achieve a workable consistency considering the weather and other conditions at the job site. We believe we can achieve product differentiation for the mixes we offer because of the variety of mixes we can produce, our volume production capacity and our scheduling, delivery and placement reliability. Additionally, we believe our EF Technology initiative, which utilizes alternative materials and mix designs that result in lower CO2 emissions, helps differentiate us from our competitors. We also believe we distinguish ourselves with our value-added service approach that emphasizes reducing our customers’ overall construction costs by reducing the in-place cost of concrete and the time required for construction.
Our volumetric concrete operations expand our ready-mixed concrete delivery and service offerings in Texas. Volumetric ready-mixed concrete trucks mix concrete to the customer's specification on the job site, better serving smaller jobs and specialized applications, and allowing flexibility for servicing remote job locations. Because of their versatility, these trucks offer the contractor multiple options for a single job without the inconvenience or added costs typically associated with standard ready-mixed trucks delivering special or short-loads to a job site. Because of their unique on-demand production capabilities, these trucks minimize the amount of wasted concrete, which improves margins and reduces environmental impact.

From a contractor’s perspective, the in-place cost of concrete includes both the amount paid to the ready-mixed concrete manufacturer and the internal costs associated with the labor and equipment the contractor provides. A contractor’s unit cost of concrete is often only a small component of the total in-place cost that takes into account all the labor and equipment costs required to build the forms for the ready-mixed concrete and place and finish the ready-mixed concrete, including the cost of additional labor and time lost as a result of substandard products or delivery delays not covered by warranty or insurance. By carefully designing proper mixes and using advances in mixing technology, we can assist our customers in reducing the amount of reinforcing steel, time and labor they will require in various applications.
We provide a variety of services in connection with our sale of ready-mixed concrete that can help reduce our customers’ in-place cost of concrete. These services include:

• | production of formulations and alternative product recommendations that reduce labor and materials costs;


• | quality control, through automated production and laboratory testing, that ensures consistent results and minimizes the need to correct completed work; and


• | automated scheduling and tracking systems that ensure timely delivery and reduce the downtime incurred by the customer’s placing and finishing crews.

We produce ready-mixed concrete by combining the desired type of cement, other cementitious materials (described below), sand, gravel and crushed stone with water and, typically, one or more admixtures. These admixtures, such as chemicals, minerals and fibers, determine the usefulness of the product for particular applications.
We use a variety of chemical admixtures to achieve one or more of the following five basic purposes:

• | relieve internal pressure and increase resistance to cracking;


• | retard the hardening process to make concrete more workable in hot weather;


• | strengthen concrete by reducing its water content;


• | accelerate the hardening process and reduce the time required for curing; and


• | facilitate the placement of concrete having low water content.

We frequently use various mineral admixtures as supplements to cement, which we refer to as supplemental cementitious materials, to alter the permeability, strength and other properties of concrete. These materials include fly ash, ground granulated blast-furnace slag, silica fume and other natural pozzolans. These materials also reduce the amount of cement content used, which results in a reduction in CO2 emissions.
We also use fibers, such as steel, glass, and synthetic and carbon filaments as additives in various formulations of concrete. Fibers help control shrinkage cracking, thus reducing permeability and improving abrasion resistance. In many applications, fibers can replace welded steel wire and reinforcing bars. Relative to the other components of ready-mixed concrete, these additives generate comparatively higher margins.
Marketing and sales
Our marketing efforts primarily target concrete sub-contractors, general contractors, governmental agencies, property owners and developers, architects, engineers and home builders whose focus extends beyond the price of ready-mixed concrete to product quality, on-time delivery and reduction of in-place costs.
General contractors typically select their suppliers of ready-mixed concrete. In large, complex projects, an engineering firm or division within a state transportation or public works department may influence the purchasing decision, particularly if the concrete has complicated design specifications. In connection with large, complex projects and in government-funded projects generally, the general contractor or project engineer usually awards supply orders on the basis of either direct negotiation or a competitive bidding process. We believe the purchasing decision for many jobs is ultimately relationship and reputation-based.

Our marketing and sales strategy emphasizes the sale of value-added products and solutions to customers more focused on reducing their in-place building material costs than on the price per cubic yard of ready-mixed concrete. Key elements of our customer-focused approach include:

• | corporate-level marketing and sales expertise;


• | technical service expertise to develop innovative, new branded products; and


• | training programs that emphasize successful marketing and sales techniques that focus on the sale of high-margin concrete mix designs.

Operations
Our standard ready-mixed concrete plants consist of fixed and portable facilities that produce ready-mixed concrete in wet or dry batches. Our fixed-plant facilities produce ready-mixed concrete that we transport to job sites by drum mixer trucks. Our portable plant operations deploy our portable plant facilities to produce ready-mixed concrete at the job site that we direct into place using a series of conveyor belts or drum mixer trucks. We use our portable plants to service high-volume projects or projects in remote locations. Our volumetric ready-mixed concrete plants consist of fixed and portable facilities that are used to load raw materials into our volumetric mixer trucks throughout the day. Batching occurs at the job site based on customer specifications. Several factors govern the choice of plant type, including:

• | production consistency requirements;


• | daily production capacity requirements;


• | job site proximity to fixed plants; and


• | capital and financing.

We construct both wet batch plants and dry batch plants. A wet batch plant generally has a higher initial cost and daily operating expenses, but (1) yields greater consistency with less time required for quality control in the concrete produced and (2) generally has greater daily production capacity than a dry batch plant. We believe that construction of a wet batch plant having an hourly capacity of 250 cubic yards currently would cost approximately $1.6 million, while a dry batch plant having an hourly capacity of 150 cubic yards currently would cost approximately $0.8 million. As of December 31, 2017, we operated 28 wet batch plants and 134 dry batch plants. 
We maintain two types of load facilities for our volumetric ready-mixed concrete — main load sites and reload facilities. Both types of facilities typically include blending silos, a load-out pit and a storm water system. A main load facility typically also includes a maintenance shop. We estimate that constructing a main load site would currently cost approximately $0.9 million, while constructing a reload facility would currently cost approximately $0.2 million.
Our batch operator at a dry batch plant simultaneously loads the dry components of stone, sand and cement with water and admixtures in a drum mixer truck that begins the mixing process during loading and continues that process en route to our customers' job sites. In a wet batch plant, the batch operator blends the dry components and water in a plant mixer from which an operator loads the mixed concrete into a drum mixer truck, which leaves for the job site promptly after loading. At a volumetric facility, our loader operator or mixer operator coordinates loading the dry components of sand, course aggregates and cement into the bins on the truck. Water and liquid admixtures are separately loaded into the tanks on the trucks before leaving the facility for the job site.
Any future decisions we make regarding the construction of additional plants will be impacted by market factors, including:

• | the expected production demand for the plant;


• | capital and financing;


• | the expected types of projects the plant will service; and


• | the desired location of the plant.

Drum mixer trucks continuously rotate their loads en route to job sites to produce concrete at the desired consistency. Our drum mixer trucks typically have load capacities of 10 cubic yards, or approximately 20 tons, and a typical operating life of between 10 and 15 years, depending on total truck hours and miles. A new truck of this size currently costs between $160,000 and $225,000, depending on the geographic location and design specifications. Depending on the type of batch plant from which the drum mixer trucks generally are loaded, some components of the drum mixer trucks may require refurbishment after three to five years. As of December 31, 2017, we operated a fleet of more than 1,640 owned and leased drum mixer trucks, which had an average age of approximately eight years.
9

Volumetric mixer trucks include individual bins and tanks, which are used to mix the raw materials at the customer's job site based on the customer's specifications. The volumetric mixing method provides only the concrete needed for the job, eliminating wasted materials and short load charges. Our volumetric mixer trucks typically have load capacities of eight cubic yards, or approximately 16 tons, and a typical operating life of between eight to twelve years, depending on total truck hours and miles. A new truck of this size currently costs between $220,000 and $250,000, depending on the design specifications. Typically, the truck's mixer unit will be rebuilt after the initial truck life, extending the operating life of the truck an additional five years. As of December 31, 2017, we operated a fleet of 130 owned volumetric mixer trucks, which had an average age of approximately eight years. 
In our ready-mixed concrete operations, we emphasize quality control, pre-job planning, customer service and coordination of supplies and delivery. We obtain orders for ready-mixed concrete in advance of actual delivery. A typical order contains a contractor's specifications for the concrete. After receiving the specifications for a particular job, we use computer modeling, industry information and information from previous similar jobs to formulate a variety of mixtures of cement, aggregates, water and admixtures that meet or exceed the contractor’s specifications. We perform testing to determine which mix design is most appropriate to meet the required specifications. The test results enable us to select the mixture that has the lowest cost and meets or exceeds the job specifications. The testing center creates and maintains a project file that details the mixture we will use when we produce the concrete for the job. For quality control purposes, the testing center is also responsible for maintaining batch samples of concrete we have delivered to a job site.
We use computer modeling to prepare bids for particular jobs based on the size of the job, location, desired margin, cost of raw materials and the design mixture identified in our testing process. If the job is large enough and has a projected duration beyond the supply arrangement in place at that time, we obtain quotes from our suppliers as to the cost of raw materials we use to prepare the bid. Once we obtain a quote from our suppliers, the price of the raw materials for the specified job is informally established. Several months may elapse from the time a contractor has accepted our bid until actual delivery of the ready-mixed concrete begins.
During this time, we maintain regular communication with the contractor concerning the status of the job and any changes in the job’s specifications to coordinate the multisourced purchases of cement and other materials we will need to fill the job order and meet the contractor’s delivery requirements. We confirm that our customers are ready to take delivery of manufactured products throughout the placement process. On any given day, one of our plants may have production orders for dozens of customers at various locations throughout its area of operation. To fill an order:

• | the customer service team coordinates the timing and delivery of the concrete to the job site;


• | a load operator supervises and coordinates the receipt of the necessary raw materials and operates the hopper that dispenses those materials into the appropriate storage bins;


• | a batch operator, using a computerized batch panel, prepares the specified mixture from the order and oversees loading the mixer truck with either dry ingredients and water in a dry batch plant or the premixed concrete in a wet batch plant; and


• | the driver of the mixer truck delivers the load to the job site, discharges the load and, after washing the truck, departs as directed by the dispatch office.

Our central dispatch system, where available, tracks the status of each mixer truck as to whether it is:

• | loading concrete;


• | en route to a particular job site;


• | on the job site;


• | discharging concrete;


• | being rinsed down; or


• | en route to a particular plant.

The system is updated continuously on the trucks’ status via signals received from sensors. In this manner, the dispatcher can determine the optimal routing and timing of subsequent deliveries by each mixer truck and monitor the performance of each driver.
10

Our plant managers oversee the operations of each of our plants. Our operational employees also include:

• | maintenance personnel who perform routine maintenance work throughout our plants;


• | mechanics who perform the maintenance and repair work on our rolling stock;


• | testing center staff who prepare mixtures for particular job specifications and maintain quality control;


• | various clerical personnel who perform administrative tasks; and


• | sales personnel who are responsible for identifying potential customers, pricing mixes for projects and maintaining existing customer relationships.

We generally operate each of our plants on an extended single shift, with some overtime operation during the year. On occasion, however, we may have projects that require deliveries around the clock.
Aggregate products
Our aggregate products segment produces crushed stone, sand and gravel from 18 aggregates facilities located in New Jersey, Texas, Oklahoma, the U.S. Virgin Islands and British Columbia, Canada. This includes the November 2017 acquisition of Polaris, located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with one active quarry that enhances our vertical integration and access to supply West Coast markets. We sell these aggregates for use in commercial, industrial and public works projects in the markets they serve, as well as consume them internally in the production of ready-mixed concrete in those markets. We produced approximately 6.3 million tons of aggregates during the year ended December 31, 2017, with Texas / Oklahoma representing 47%, New Jersey representing 41%, British Columbia, Canada representing 8% and the U.S. Virgin Islands representing 4% of the total production. We believe our aggregates reserves provide us with additional raw material sourcing flexibility and supply availability. In addition, we own sand pit operations in Michigan and one quarry in West Texas, which we lease to third parties and receive a royalty based on the volumes produced and sold during the terms of the leases.
Other
Other products not associated with a reportable segment include our building materials stores, hauling operations, aggregates distribution terminals, lime slurry, ARIDUS® Rapid Drying Concrete technology, a recycled aggregates operation and concrete blocks.
Industry overview
Concrete has many attributes that make it a highly versatile construction material. In recent years, industry participants have developed various uses for concrete products, including:

• | high-strength engineered concrete to compete with steel-frame construction;


• | concrete housing;


• | flowable fill for backfill applications;


• | continuous-slab rail-support systems for rapid transit and heavy-traffic rail lines; and


• | concrete bridges, tunnels and other structures for rapid transit systems.

Other examples of successful innovations that have opened new markets for concrete include:

• | sustainable construction;


• | concrete paving over asphalt, or “white topping”;


• | paved concrete shoulders to replace less permanent and increasingly costly asphalt shoulders;


• | pervious concrete parking lots for water drainage management, as well as providing a long-lasting and aesthetically pleasing urban environment; 


• | colored pavements to mark entrance and exit ramps and lanes of expressways; and


• | colored, stamped concrete for decorative applications.

The U.S. ready-mixed concrete market is a large, highly competitive and fragmented market, with no one producer holding a dominant market position. The NRMCA currently estimates that the ready-mixed concrete industry generates total annual revenue of approximately $35 billion, with total volumes from the production and delivery of ready-mixed concrete of 358 million cubic yards in 2017, 343 million cubic yards in 2016 and 336 million cubic yards in 2015.
11

Based on estimates from the NRMCA, in addition to vertically integrated manufacturers of cement and aggregates, ready-mixed concrete producers currently operate approximately 5,500 plants in the United States. Larger markets generally have several producers competing for business on the basis of product quality, service, on-time delivery and price.
According to FMI Corp. ("FMI"), spending on total residential, non-residential and non-building construction is projected to grow at a steady rate through 2019. FMI projects the following growth rates in 2018: residential construction of 5-7%, commercial and office construction of 7-9% and street and highway construction of 2%. According to the PCA, annual ready-mixed concrete usage is expected to strengthen in our key markets in California, Texas / Oklahoma and our Atlantic Region with 2018 to 2021 estimated compound annual growth rates of 4.4%, 3.3% and 3.1%, respectively. Moreover, the National Association of Home Builders and Fannie Mae predict U.S. residential construction will continue to make gains with a median estimate of approximately 900,000 and 400,000 single-family and multi-family housing starts in 2018, respectively. 
During the past decade, public concerns about dust, process water runoff, noise, and heavy mixer and other truck traffic associated with the operation of ready-mixed concrete manufacturing operations and their general appearance have made obtaining the permits and licenses required for new plants more difficult. Delays in the regulatory process, coupled with the capital investment that start-up operations entail, create complexities for these start-up plants.
Cement and other raw materials
We obtain most of the materials necessary to manufacture ready-mixed concrete on a daily basis. These materials include cement, other cementitious materials (such as fly ash and blast furnace slag) and aggregates (stone, gravel and sand), in addition to certain chemical admixtures. With the exception of chemical admixtures, each plant typically maintains an inventory level of these materials sufficient to satisfy its operating needs for a few days. Our inventory levels do not decline significantly or comparatively with declines in revenue during seasonally low periods. We generally maintain inventory at specified levels to maximize purchasing efficiencies and to be able to respond quickly to customer demand.
Typically, cement, other cementitious materials and aggregates represent the highest-cost materials used in manufacturing a cubic yard of ready-mixed concrete. We purchase cement from a few suppliers in each of our major geographic markets. Chemical admixtures are generally purchased from suppliers under national purchasing agreements.
Overall, prices for cement and aggregates increased in 2017, compared to 2016, in all of our major geographic markets. Generally, we negotiate with suppliers on a company-wide basis and at the local market level to obtain the most competitive pricing available for cement and aggregates. We believe the demand for cement is increasing and will warrant scrutiny as construction activity increases. Today, in most of our markets, we believe there is an adequate supply of cement and aggregates. 
We recognize the value in advocating green building and construction as part of our strategy. We initiated EF Technology, our commitment to environmentally friendly concrete technologies that significantly reduce potential CO2 emissions. Our EF Technology ready-mixed concrete products replace a portion of cement with reclaimed fly ash, blast furnace slag and other materials. We believe this results in an environmentally superior and sustainable alternative to traditional ready-mixed concrete. EF Technology reduces greenhouse gases and landfill space consumption and produces a highly durable product. Customers can also obtain LEED credits through the use of this technology. We believe our use of this technology creates a competitive advantage over smaller concrete producers and larger vertically integrated aggregate and cement companies that may not focus on this as a first solution. We are positioned to take advantage of the growing demand for these products which could expand our operating margins as they are a lower cost alternative to cement. 
Customers
Of our concrete product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, commercial and industrial construction represented approximately 56%, residential construction represented approximately 26% and street, highway construction and other public works represented approximately 18%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, no single customer or project accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue.
We rely heavily on repeat customers. Our management and sales personnel are responsible for developing and maintaining successful long-term relationships with our key customers.

The ready-mixed concrete industry is highly competitive. Our leadership position in a market depends largely on the location and operating costs of our plants and prevailing prices in that market. Price is the primary competitive factor among suppliers for small or less complex jobs, such as residential construction. However, the ability to meet demanding specifications for strength or sustainability, timeliness of delivery and consistency of quality and service, in addition to price, are the principal competitive factors among suppliers for large or complex jobs. Our competitors range from small, owner-operated private companies to subsidiaries of operating units of large, vertically integrated manufacturers of cement and aggregates. Our vertically integrated competitors generally have greater financial and marketing resources than we have, providing them with a competitive advantage. Competitors having lower operating costs than we do or having the financial resources to enable them to accept lower margins than we do will have a competitive advantage over us for jobs that are particularly price-sensitive. Competitors having greater financial resources or less financial leverage than we do may be able to invest more in new mixer trucks, ready-mixed concrete plants and other production equipment or pay for acquisitions which could provide them a competitive advantage over us. See “Risk factors - We may lose business to competitors who underbid us, and we may be otherwise unable to compete favorably in our highly competitive and fragmented industry.”
We continue to focus on developing new competitive advantages that will differentiate us from our competitors, such as our high-performing, low-CO2 concrete and ARIDUS® Rapid Drying Concrete technology. For example, Central Concrete Supply Co., Inc. (“Central Concrete”), one of our subsidiaries, differentiated itself from its competitors to supply its high-performing, low-CO2 concrete for Levi's Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers. Central Concrete supplied an estimated 80,000 cubic yards of concrete for the auger cast piles and the overall stadium structure, sidewalks and architectural concrete.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 675 salaried employees, including executive officers and management, sales, technical, administrative and clerical personnel and 2,395 hourly personnel. The number of employees fluctuates depending on the number and size of projects ongoing at any particular time, which may be impacted by variations in weather conditions throughout the year.
As of December 31, 2017, 1,121 of our employees were represented by labor unions having collective bargaining agreements with us. Generally, these agreements have multi-year terms and expire on a staggered basis between 2018 and 2022. Under these agreements, we pay specified wages to covered employees and in most cases make payments to multi-employer pension plans and employee benefit trusts rather than administering the funds on behalf of these employees. We have not experienced any strikes or significant work stoppages in the past seven years. We believe our relationships with our employees and union representatives are very good.
Training and safety
Our future success will depend, in part, on the extent to which we can attract, retain and motivate qualified employees. We believe that our ability to do so will depend, in part, on providing a work environment that allows employees the opportunity to develop and maximize their capabilities. We require all field employees to attend periodic safety training meetings and all drivers to participate in training seminars. We employ a national safety director whose responsibilities include managing and executing a unified, company-wide safety program. Employee development and safety are criteria used in evaluating performance in our annual incentive plan for certain salaried employees.
Governmental regulation and environmental matters
A wide range of federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations apply to our operations, including the following matters:

• | water usage;


• | land usage;


• | street and highway usage;


• | noise levels; and


• | health, safety and environmental matters.

In many instances, we are required to have various certificates, permits, or licenses to conduct our business. Our failure to maintain these required authorizations or to comply with applicable laws or other governmental requirements could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations. Delays in obtaining approvals for the transfer or grant of authorizations, or failures to obtain new authorizations, could impede acquisition efforts.
Environmental laws that impact our operations include those relating to air quality, solid waste management and water quality. These laws are complex and subject to frequent change. They impose strict liability in some cases without regard to negligence or fault. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. In addition, businesses may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. These laws also may expose us to liability for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, others or for acts that complied with all applicable laws when performed.
We have conducted Phase I environmental site assessments, which are non-intrusive investigations conducted to evaluate the potential for significant on-site environmental impacts, on substantially all the real properties we own or lease and have engaged independent environmental consulting firms to complete those assessments. We have not identified any environmental concerns associated with those properties that we believe are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, but we can provide no assurance material liabilities will not occur. In addition, we can provide no assurance that our compliance with amended, new or more stringent laws, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the future discovery of environmental conditions will not require additional, material expenditures.
We believe we have all material permits and licenses we need to conduct our operations and are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements relating to our operations. Our capital expenditures relating to environmental matters were not material in 2017.
Product warranties
Our operations involve providing ready-mixed concrete that must meet building codes or other regulatory requirements and contractual specifications for durability, stress-level capacity, weight-bearing capacity and other characteristics. If we fail or are unable to provide products meeting these requirements and specifications, material claims may arise against us and our reputation could be damaged. In the past, we have had significant claims of this kind asserted against us that we have resolved. There currently are, and we expect that in the future there may be, additional claims of this kind asserted against us. If a significant product-related claim is resolved against us in the future, that resolution may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Insurance
Our employees perform a significant portion of their work moving and storing large quantities of heavy raw materials, driving large mixer and other trucks in heavy traffic conditions and delivering concrete at construction sites or in other areas that may be hazardous. These operating hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of properties and equipment, and environmental damage. We maintain insurance coverage in amounts and against the risks we believe are in accordance with industry practice, but this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities we may incur in our operations, and we may be unable to maintain insurance of the types or at levels we deem necessary or adequate or at rates we consider reasonable.
Legal proceedings
From time to time, and currently, we are subject to various claims and litigation brought by employees, customers and other third parties for, among other matters, personal injuries, property damage, product defects and delay damages that have, or allegedly have, resulted from the conduct of our operations as well as disputes related to prior acquisitions. As a result of these types of claims and litigation, we must periodically evaluate the probability of damages being assessed against us and the range of possible outcomes. In each reporting period, if we determine that the likelihood of damages being assessed against us is probable, and, if we believe we can estimate a range of possible outcomes, then we will record a liability. The amount of the liability will be based upon a specific estimate, if we believe a specific estimate to be likely, or it will reflect the low end of our range. Currently, there are no material legal proceedings pending against us.

In the future, we may receive funding deficiency demands related to multi-employer plans to which we contribute. We are unable to estimate the amount of any potential future funding deficiency demands, because the actions of each of the other contributing employers in the plans has an effect on each of the other contributing employers, and the development of a rehabilitation plan by the trustees and subsequent submittal to and approval by the Internal Revenue Service is not predictable. Further, the allocation of fund assets and return assumptions by trustees are variable, as are actual investment returns relative to the plan assumptions.
As of March 1, 2018, there are no material product defect claims pending against us. Accordingly, our existing accruals for claims against us do not reflect any material amounts relating to product defect claims. While our management is not aware of any facts that would reasonably be expected to lead to material product defect claims against us that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, it is possible that claims could be asserted against us in the future. We do not maintain insurance that would cover all damages resulting from product defect claims. In particular, we generally do not maintain insurance coverage for the cost of removing and rebuilding structures. In addition, our indemnification arrangements with contractors or others, when obtained, generally provide only limited protection against product defect claims. Due to inherent uncertainties associated with estimating unasserted claims in our business, we cannot estimate the amount of any future loss that may be attributable to unasserted product defect claims related to ready-mixed concrete we have delivered prior to December 31, 2017.
We believe that the resolution of all litigation currently pending or threatened against us or any of our subsidiaries will not materially exceed our existing accruals for those matters. However, because of the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there is a risk that we may have to increase our accruals for one or more claims or proceedings to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party as more information becomes available or proceedings progress, and any such increase in accruals could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. We expect in the future that we and our operating subsidiaries will, from time to time, be a party to litigation or administrative proceedings that arise in the normal course of our business.
We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, air emissions and wastewater discharge. Our management believes we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. From time to time, we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and entities asserting that we may be in violation of environmental laws and regulations. Based on experience and the information currently available, our management does not believe that these claims will materially exceed our related accruals. Despite compliance and experience, it is possible that we could be held liable for future charges, which might be material, but are not currently known to us or cannot be estimated by us. In addition, changes in federal or state laws, regulations or requirements, or discovery of currently unknown conditions, could require additional expenditures.
As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements that provide indemnification of officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have a director and officer insurance policy that potentially limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of future amounts that may be paid. As a result of the insurance policy coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we have not recorded any liabilities for these agreements as of December 31, 2017.
We and our subsidiaries are parties to agreements that require us to provide indemnification in certain instances when we acquire businesses and real estate and in the ordinary course of business with our customers, suppliers, lessors and service providers.
