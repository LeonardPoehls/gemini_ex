Item 1. Business
General
 
Eastern Virginia Bankshares, Inc. (the “Company”) is a bank holding company that was organized and chartered under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia on September 5, 1997 and commenced operations on December 29, 1997. The Company was headquartered in Tappahannock, Virginia until October 2016 at which time it was relocated to Glen Allen, Virginia. Through our wholly-owned bank subsidiary, EVB (the “Bank”) which is headquartered in Tappahannock, Virginia, we operate twenty-four full service branches and two drive-in facilities in eastern Virginia, and one loan production office in Chesterfield County, Virginia. Two of EVB’s three predecessor banks, Bank of Northumberland, Inc. and Southside Bank, were established in 1910. The third bank, Hanover Bank, was established as a de novo bank in 2000. In April 2006, these three banks were merged and the surviving bank was re-branded as EVB. Additionally, the Company acquired Virginia Company Bank (“VCB”) on November 14, 2014 and merged VCB with and into the Bank with the Bank surviving, thereby adding to the Bank three additional branches located in Hampton, Newport News and Williamsburg. On December 13, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to merge with and into Southern National Bancorp of Virginia, Inc. (“Southern National”), with Southern National surviving (such transaction, the “Pending Merger”). The Pending Merger, which is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2017, is subject to regulatory approvals and the approval of the shareholders of both companies, as well as customary closing conditions.
 
EVB is a community bank targeting small to medium-sized businesses and consumers in our traditional coastal plain markets and the emerging suburbs outside of the Richmond, Tidewater, and southern Virginia areas. Our mission is to enable our customers, teammates and shareholders to achieve their financial dreams and goals, making our communities better places to live.
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Bank and its subsidiaries, at times collectively referred to as the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us.”
 
We provide a broad range of personal and commercial banking services including commercial, consumer and real estate loans. We complement our lending operations with an array of retail and commercial deposit products and fee-based services. Our services are delivered locally by well-trained and experienced bankers, whom we empower to make decisions at the local level, so they can provide timely lending decisions and respond promptly to customer inquiries. Having been in many of our markets for over 100 years, we have established relationships with and an understanding of our customers. We believe that, by offering our customers personalized service and a breadth of products, we can compete effectively as we expand within our existing markets and into new markets.
 
The Bank owns EVB Financial Services, Inc., which in turn has a 100% ownership interest in EVB Investments, Inc. EVB Investments, Inc. offers a comprehensive range of investment services through Infinex Investments, Inc. On May 15, 2014, the Bank acquired a 4.9% ownership interest in Southern Trust Mortgage, LLC. Pursuant to an independent contractor agreement with Southern Trust Mortgage, LLC, the Company advises and consults with Southern Trust Mortgage, LLC and facilitates the marketing and brand recognition of their mortgage business. In addition, the Company provides Southern Trust Mortgage, LLC with offices at two retail branches in the Company’s market area and access to office equipment at these locations during normal business hours. For its services, the Company receives fixed monthly compensation from Southern Trust Mortgage, LLC in the amount of $2 thousand, which is adjustable on a quarterly basis.
 
The Bank has a 6.0% ownership interest in Bankers Title, LLC. Bankers Title, LLC is a multi-bank owned title agency providing a full range of title insurance settlement and related financial services. The Bank has a 2.94% ownership in Bankers Insurance, LLC, which primarily sells insurance products to customers of the Bank, and other financial institutions that have an equity interest in the agency. The Bank also has 100% ownership interests in Dunston Hall LLC and POS LLC, which were formed to hold the title to real estate acquired by the Bank upon foreclosure on property of real estate secured loans. The financial position and operating results of all the subsidiaries of the Bank are not significant to the Company as a whole and are not considered principal activities of the Company at this time.
 
The Company also owns one non-operating subsidiary, EVB Statutory Trust I (the “Trust”), that was formed in September 2003. The Trust was formed for the purpose of issuing $10.0 million of trust preferred capital securities. The Trust is an unconsolidated subsidiary of the Company and its principal asset is $10.3 million of the Company’s junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures (the “Junior Subordinated Debt”) that is reported as a liability of the Company.

Market Areas
 
The Company currently conducts business through twenty-four full service branches and two drive-in facilities, primarily in the eastern portion of the state. Our markets are located east of U.S. Route 250 and extend from northeast of Richmond to the Chesapeake Bay and Hampton in central Virginia and across the James River from Colonial Heights to southeastern Virginia. Geographically, we have five primary market areas: Northern Neck, Middle Peninsula, Capital (suburbs of Richmond), Tidewater (Williamsburg, Newport News and Hampton), and Southern.
 
Our Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula regions are in the eastern coastal plain of Virginia, often referred to as River Country. A number of the branches in this locale have been in business for over one hundred years and have strong customer ties going back over multiple generations. According to the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, the region’s industries have traditionally been associated with abundant natural resources that include five rivers and the Chesapeake Bay. The diversified economy includes seafood harvesting, light manufacturing, agriculture, leisure, marine services and service sectors dedicated to many upscale retirement communities.
 
Our Capital region is currently comprised of Chesterfield, Hanover, Henrico and King William counties and Colonial Heights, which are largely emerging suburbs of Richmond. Hanover County is approximately 10 miles from downtown Richmond and eighty-six miles south of Washington, DC. Hanover County is the largest county by area in the Richmond metropolitan area. The county provides residents and businesses the geographic advantages of a growing metropolitan area coupled with substantial acreage for expansion in a suburban setting. With a branch and our corporate headquarters in the adjacent county of Henrico, which is closer to Richmond, we have the advantage of an established economic setting with many small business prospects. Our location in Colonial Heights puts us in the south Richmond suburbs and allows us to capitalize on economic activity related to the U.S. Army facility at Fort Lee. The other county, King William, offers us growth opportunities as the Richmond suburbs expand farther east of their current boundaries.
 
Our Tidewater region is currently comprised of Williamsburg, Newport News and Hampton. This area, located approximately 60 miles east of Richmond along the U.S. Interstate 64 corridor, is part of the Hampton Roads MSA and is a densely populated and well-established area. This major metropolitan area is the second largest metropolitan area in Virginia behind the Northern Virginia area and is home to the third largest harbor in the U.S., which supports extensive military and commercial shipping operations. In addition to being home to several Fortune 500 companies, the region has a high value customer base, such as entrepreneurs, small businesses, and professionals, which often are not well served by our larger competitors. The banking facilities in this region offer a wide range of banking products and services, including mortgage, investment and insurance products.
 
Our Southern region is comprised of New Kent, Surry, Sussex, and Southampton counties. New Kent has shown continued population growth over the past several years. Our Southern Region is located southeast of Richmond and north of Williamsburg placing us in the growth zone of U.S. Interstate 64 that runs from Richmond to the Virginia Beach area of the Virginia Tidewater region. The other three counties are approximately fifty miles southeast of Richmond along or just off the state U.S. Route 460 corridor and are adjacent to the Greater Tidewater area. The ports of Hampton Roads are approximately fifty miles to the east of our Southern region. The region’s close proximity to major military, naval and research centers and transportation infrastructure make this an attractive location for contractors and service and manufacturing companies.
 
Business Strategy
 
As a result of over 100 years of experience serving the Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula regions, we have a stable, loyal customer base and a high deposit market share in these regions. Due to the lower projected population growth of these markets, we expanded in Chesterfield, Hanover, Henrico, Gloucester, New Kent and King William Counties and the city of Colonial Heights to target the higher potential growth in these existing and emerging suburban markets. The deposit market share we have accumulated in our Northern Neck, Middle Peninsula and Southern regions has helped fund our loan growth in the emerging suburban areas in the Capital region. Additionally, in 2014 we expanded into our Tidewater region through the acquisition of VCB. This acquisition added three branches and expanded our footprint along the U.S. Interstate 64 corridor into the attractive and growing markets of the Virginia Peninsula.

We believe that economic growth and bank consolidation have created a growing number of businesses and consumers in need of a broad range of products and services, as well as the high level of personal service that we provide. We look at 2017 as a year to strengthen our existing markets. Our long-term business plan is to capitalize on the growth opportunity in our markets by further developing our branch network and augmenting our market area, including through the Pending Merger with Southern National.
 
Competition
 
The Bank encounters strong competition for its banking services within its primary market areas. The sources of competition vary based on the particular market of operation, which can range from a small rural town to part of a large urban market. The Bank competes with large national and regional financial institutions, savings associations and other independent community banks, as well as credit unions, mutual funds and life insurance companies. The banking business in the Bank’s primary market areas is highly competitive for both loans and deposits, and is dominated by a relatively small number of large banks with many offices operating over a wide geographic area. Among the advantages such large banks have over the Bank are their ability to offer banking products and services at large branch networks, to launch and finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns and, by virtue of their greater total capitalization, to have substantially higher lending limits than the Bank. In addition, large banks may more easily comply with certain regulations applicable to banking activities and consumer financial products and services.
 
Factors such as interest rates offered, the number and location of branches and the types of products offered, as well as the reputation of the institution, affect competition for deposits and loans. The Bank competes by emphasizing customer service and technology, establishing long-term customer relationships, building customer loyalty, and providing products and services to address the specific needs of its customers. The Bank targets individuals and small to medium sized business customers. No material part of the Bank’s business is dependent upon a single or a few customers, and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect upon the Bank’s business.
 
Because federal regulation of financial institutions changes regularly and is the subject of constant legislative debate, we cannot foresee how federal regulation of financial institutions may change in the future. However, it is possible that current and future governmental regulatory and economic initiatives could impact the competitive landscape in the Bank’s markets.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had 315 full-time equivalent employees. Management of the Company considers its relations with employees to be excellent. No employees are represented by a union or any similar group, and the Company has never experienced any strike or labor dispute.
Regulation and Supervision
 
General
 
Bank holding companies, banks and their affiliates are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders and creditors. The following summary briefly describes significant provisions of currently applicable federal and state laws and certain regulations and the potential impact of such provisions on the Company and the Bank. This summary is not complete, and we refer you to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals for more information. Because regulation of financial institutions changes regularly and is the subject of constant legislative and regulatory debate, we cannot forecast how federal and state regulation and supervision of financial institutions may change in the future and affect the Company’s and the Bank’s operations.
Regulatory Reform
 
The financial crisis of 2008, including the downturn of global economic, financial and money markets and the threat of collapse of numerous financial institutions, and other related events led to the adoption of numerous laws and regulations that apply to financial institutions. The most significant of these laws is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), adopted on July 21, 2010 to implement significant structural reforms to the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act is discussed in more detail below.

The Company continues to experience a period of rapidly changing regulatory requirements and an environment of constant regulatory reform. These regulatory changes could have a significant effect on how the Company conducts its business. The full extent of the Dodd-Frank Act and other potential regulatory reforms cannot yet be fully predicted and will depend to a large extent on the specific regulations that are adopted.
 
Regulation of the Company
 
As a public company, the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). As a result, the Company must file annual, quarterly, current and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and also comply with other laws and regulations of the SEC applicable to public companies.
 
As a bank holding company, the Company is also subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHCA”) and supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”). Generally, a bank holding company is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of a bank or bank holding company, including through a bank or bank holding company merger or acquisition, completing a non-bank acquisition, or engaging in an activity considered to be a banking activity, either directly or through a subsidiary. Bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions on transactions with insiders and affiliates.
 
Pursuant to the BHCA, the Federal Reserve Board has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve Board has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or ownership constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.
 
The BHCA generally limits the activities of a bank holding company and its subsidiaries to that of banking, managing or controlling banks, or any other activity that is closely related to banking or to managing or controlling banks, and permits interstate banking acquisitions subject to certain conditions, including national and state concentration limits. The Federal Reserve Board has jurisdiction under the BHCA to approve any bank or non-bank acquisition, merger or consolidation proposed by a bank holding company. A bank holding company must be well capitalized and well managed to engage in an interstate acquisition or merger, and banks may branch across state lines provided that the law of the state in which the branch is to be located would permit establishment of the branch if the bank were a state bank chartered by such state.
 
A bank holding company is prohibited from engaging in or acquiring, either directly or indirectly through a subsidiary, ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company engaged in non-banking activities. A bank holding company may, however, engage in or acquire an interest in a company that engages in activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation or order are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to banking. A bank holding company also may become eligible to engage in activities that are financial in nature or complimentary to financial activities by qualifying as a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLBA”). To qualify as a financial holding company, each insured depository institution controlled by the bank holding company must be well-capitalized, well-managed and have at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. To date, the Company has not qualified as a financial holding company, and the qualification as such by other bank holding companies has not had a material impact on the business of the Company.
 
Each of the Bank’s depository accounts is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) against loss to the depositor to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and federal law and regulatory policy impose a number of obligations and restrictions on the Company and the Bank to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositors and to the FDIC insurance funds. For example, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company must commit resources to support its subsidiary depository institutions, which is referred to as serving as a “source of strength.” In addition, insured depository institutions under common control must reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) as a result of the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution. The FDIC may decline to enforce the provisions if it determines that a waiver is in the best interest of the DIF. An FDIC claim for damage is superior to claims of stockholders of an insured depository institution or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt, other than affiliates, of the commonly controlled insured depository institution.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”) provides that amounts received from the liquidation or other resolution of any insured depository institution must be distributed, after payment of secured claims, to pay the deposit liabilities of the institution before payment of any other general creditor or stockholder of that institution - including that institution’s parent holding company. This provision would give depositors a preference over general and subordinated creditors and stockholders if a receiver is appointed to distribute the assets of the Bank.
 
The Company also is subject to regulation and supervision by the Virginia State Corporation Commission Bureau of Financial Institutions (the “Bureau”).
 
Capital Requirements
 
The Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have adopted rules to implement the Basel III capital framework as outlined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and standards for calculating risk-weighted assets and risk-based capital measurements (collectively, the “Basel III Capital Rules”) that apply to banking organizations they supervise. For the purposes of these capital rules, (i) common equity tier 1 capital (“CET1”) consists principally of common stock (including surplus) and retained earnings; (ii) Tier 1 capital consists principally of CET1 plus non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, and certain grandfathered cumulative preferred stocks and trust preferred securities; and (iii) Tier 2 capital consists principally of Tier 1 capital plus qualifying subordinated debt and preferred stock, and limited amounts of the allowance for loan losses. Each regulatory capital classification is subject to certain adjustments and limitations, as implemented by the Basel III Capital Rules. The Basel III Capital Rules also establish risk weightings that are applied to many classes of assets held by community banks, importantly including applying higher risk weightings to certain commercial real estate loans.
 
The Basel III Capital Rules were effective January 1, 2015, and the Basel III Capital Rules capital conservation buffer will be phased in from 2016 to 2019.
 
When fully phased in, the Basel III Capital Rules require banks to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7% upon full implementation), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter).
 
The Basel III Capital Rules provide deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital measures, primarily to CET1, including deductions and adjustments that were not applied to reduce CET1 under historical regulatory capital rules. For example, mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets, dependent upon future taxable income, and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities must be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. These deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital will generally be phased in beginning in 2015 through 2018.
 
The Basel III Capital Rules permanently includes in Tier 1 capital trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital. The Company expects that its trust preferred securities will be included in the Company’s Tier 1 capital until their maturity.
 
The Basel III Capital Rules also implement a “countercyclical capital buffer,” generally designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk. This buffer is a CET1 add-on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% when fully implemented (potentially resulting in total buffers of between 2.5% and 5%).

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios as of December 31, 2016 were as follows (including the impact of the capital conservation buffer):
 

· | 5.1250% CET1 to risk-weighted assets.
--+--------------------------------------


· | 6.6250% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets.
--+------------------------------------------------


· | 8.6250% Total capital to risk-weighted assets.
--+-----------------------------------------------

 
The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories than has been historically applied, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. Specific changes that impacted the Company’s determination of risk-weighted assets included, among other things:
 

· | Applying a 150% risk weight instead of a 100% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Assigning a 150% risk weight to exposures (other than residential mortgage exposures) that are 90 days past due.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Providing for a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (currently set at 0%).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Management believes that, as of December 31, 2016, the Company would have met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis as if such requirements were then in effect.
 
Limits on Dividends
 
The Company is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from the Bank, and the ability of the Company to pay dividends depends upon the amount of dividends declared by the Bank, if any. In addition, the ability of the Company to pay dividends is subject to various laws and regulations, including limits on the sources of dividends and requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums. Regulatory restrictions also exist with respect to the Bank’s ability to pay dividends. Banking regulators have indicated that Virginia banking organizations should generally pay dividends only (1) from net undivided profits of the bank, after providing for all expenses, losses, interest and taxes accrued or due by the bank, and (2) if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, Federal Reserve Board supervisory guidance indicates that the Federal Reserve Board may have safety and soundness concerns if a bank holding company pays dividends that exceed earnings for the period in which the dividend is being paid. Further, the FDIA prohibits insured depository institutions such as the Bank from making capital distributions, including paying dividends, if after making such distribution the institution would become undercapitalized as defined in the statute.
Reporting Obligations
 
As a bank holding company, the Company must file with the Federal Reserve Board an annual report and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the BHCA. The Bank must submit to federal and state regulators annual audit reports prepared by independent auditors. The Company’s annual report, which includes the report of the Company’s independent auditors, can be used to satisfy this requirement. The Bank must submit quarterly, to the FDIC, Reports of Condition and Income (referred to in the banking industry as a Call Report). The Company must submit quarterly, to the Federal Reserve Board, Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (FR Y-9C) and Parent Company Only Financial Statements for Large Bank Holding Companies (FR Y-9LP).
The Dodd-Frank Act
 
The Dodd-Frank Act implements far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including changes that have affected all bank holding companies and banks, including the Company and the Bank. Provisions that significantly affect the business of the Company and the Bank include the following:

· | Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Dodd-Frank Act changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital. The Dodd-Frank Act also made permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance and increased the cash limit of Securities Investor Protection Corporation protection from $100,000 to $250,000.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-


· | Payment of Interest on Demand Deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). The Dodd-Frank Act centralized significant aspects of consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the CFPB, which is discussed in more detail below.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Debit Card Interchange Fees. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed limits for debit card interchange fees for issuers that have over $10 billion in assets, which could affect the amount of interchange fees collected by financial institutions with less than $10 billion in assets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act implements other changes to financial regulations, including provisions that:
 

· | Restrict the preemption of state law by federal law and disallow subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks from availing themselves of such preemption.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Impose comprehensive regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market, subject to significant rulemaking processes, which would include certain provisions that would effectively prohibit insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives businesses in the institution itself.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Require loan originators to retain 5 percent of any loan sold or securitized, unless it is a "qualified residential mortgage," subject to certain exceptions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Implement corporate governance revisions that apply to all public companies not just publicly-traded financial institutions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Dodd-Frank Act contains many other provisions, and federal regulators continue to draft implementing regulations which may affect the Company or the Bank. Accordingly, the topics discussed above are only a representative sample of the types of new or increasing regulatory issues in the Dodd-Frank Act that may have an impact on the Company and the Bank.
 
Source of Strength Doctrine
 
The Dodd-Frank Act codifies and expands the existing Federal Reserve Board policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the term “source of financial strength” is defined to mean the “ability of a company that directly or indirectly controls an insured depository institution to provide financial assistance to such insured depository institution in the event of the financial distress of the insured depository institution.” As of March 2017, implementing regulations of the Dodd-Frank Act source of strength provisions, however, have not yet been promulgated. It is the Federal Reserve Board’s existing policy that a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. Consistent with this, the Federal Reserve Board has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company should generally not maintain a given rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition.
Incentive Compensation
 
The Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC have issued regulatory guidance (the “Incentive Compensation Guidance”) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Federal Reserve Board will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination and incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. The federal banking agencies emphasize that all banking organizations must carefully design and oversee incentive compensation policies to ensure such policies do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations.

In 2016, the SEC and the federal banking agencies proposed rules that prohibit covered financial institutions (including bank holding companies and banks) from establishing or maintaining incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing covered persons (consisting of senior executive officers and significant risk takers, as defined in the rules) with excessive compensation, fees or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the financial institution. The proposed rules outline factors to be considered when analyzing whether compensation is excessive and whether an incentive-based compensation arrangement encourages inappropriate risks that could lead to material loss to the covered financial institution, and establishes minimum requirements that incentive-based compensation arrangements must meet to be considered to not encourage inappropriate risks and to appropriately balance risk and reward. The proposed rules also impose additional corporate governance requirements on the boards of directors of covered financial institutions and imposes additional record-keeping requirements. The comment period for these proposed rules has closed and a final rule has not yet been published.
 
Regulation of the Bank
 
The Bank, as a state-chartered member bank of the Federal Reserve System, is subject to regulation and examination by the Bureau and the Federal Reserve Board. The various laws and regulations issued and administered by the regulatory agencies (including the CFPB) affect corporate practices, such as the payment of dividends, the incurrence of debt and the acquisition of financial institutions and other companies, and affect business practices and operations, such as the payment of interest on deposits, the charging of interest on loans, and the types of business conduct, the products and terms offered to customers. In addition, the Bank is subject to the rules and regulations of the FDIC, which currently insures substantially all of the Bank’s deposits up to applicable limits of the DIF, and is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF.
 
Prior approval of the applicable primary federal regulatory and the Bureau is required for a Virginia chartered bank or a bank holding company to merge with another bank or bank holding company, or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank or bank holding company, or acquire control of another bank or bank holding company. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the financial condition and capital position of, and any asset concentrations (including commercial real estate loan concentrations) of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant’s performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act and fair housing initiatives, the data security and cybersecurity infrastructure of the constituent organizations and the combined organization, and the applicant’s compliance with and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities and complying with Bank Secrecy Act requirements.
 
FDIC Insurance, Assessments and Regulation
 
The Bank’s deposits are insured by the DIF of the FDIC up to the standard maximum insurance amount for each deposit ownership category. As of March 2017, the basic limit on FDIC deposit insurance coverage was $250,000 per depositor. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC, subject to administrative and potential judicial hearing and review processes.
 
The DIF is funded by assessments on banks and other depository institutions calculated based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity (defined as Tier 1 capital). As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted a large-bank pricing assessment scheme, set a target “designated reserve ratio” (described in more detail below) of 2% for the DIF and established a lower assessment rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 1.15% and, in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower assessment rate schedule, when the reserve ratio reaches 2% and 2.5%. An institution's assessment rate is based on a statistical analysis of financial ratios that estimates the likelihood of failure over a three year period, which considers the institution’s weighted average CAMELS component rating, and is subject to further adjustments including related to levels of unsecured debt and brokered deposits (not applicable to banks with less than $10 billion in assets). At December 31, 2016 total base assessment rates for institutions that have been insured for at least five years range from 1.5 to 40 basis points, with rates of 1.5 to 30 basis points applying to banks with less than $10 billion in assets.

The Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the FDIC increased discretion with regard to managing the required amount of reserves for the DIF, or the “designated reserve ratio.” Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act (i) raised the minimum designated reserve ratio to 1.35% and removed the upper limit on the designated reserve ratio, (ii) requires that the designated reserve ratio reach 1.35% by September 2020, and (iii) requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion of raising the designated reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% – which requirement was met through rules adopted by the FDIC during 2016. The FDIA requires that the FDIC consider the appropriate level for the designated reserve ratio on at least an annual basis. On October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. On June 30, 2016 the designated reserve ratio rose to 1.17 percent, which triggered three major changes to deposit insurance assessments for the third quarter of 2016: (i) the range of initial assessment rates for all institutions declined from 5 to 35 basis points to 3 to 30 basis points (which are included in the total base assessment rates in the above paragraph); (ii) surcharges equal to an annual rate of 4.5 basis points began for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more; and (iii) the revised assessment method described above was implemented.
 
FDIC insurance expense totaled $707 thousand, $821 thousand and $921 thousand in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. FDIC insurance expense includes deposit insurance assessments and Financing Corporation (“FICO”) assessments related to outstanding FICO bonds. The FICO is a mixed-ownership government corporation established by the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 whose sole purpose was to function as a financing vehicle for the now defunct Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation. The FICO assessment rate for the DIF ranged between a high of 0.58 basis points for 2016, with a low of 0.56 basis points for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2016. For the first quarter of 2017, the FICO assessment rate for the DIF is 0.54 basis points resulting in a premium of $0.0054 per $100 of DIF-eligible deposits.
 
Prompt Corrective Action
 
The federal banking agencies have broad powers under current federal law to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions. The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in question is “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” These terms are defined under uniform regulations issued by each of the federal banking agencies regulating these institutions. An insured depository institution which is less than adequately capitalized must adopt an acceptable capital restoration plan, is subject to increased regulatory oversight and is increasingly restricted in the scope of its permissible activities. The Company believes that, as of December 31, 2016, its bank subsidiary, EVB, was “well capitalized” based on the applicable ratios.
Mortgage Banking Regulation
 
In connection with making mortgage loans, the Bank is subject to rules and regulations that, among other things, establish standards for loan origination, prohibit discrimination, require certain disclosures, provide for inspections and appraisals of property, require credit reports on prospective borrowers and, in some cases, restrict certain loan features and fix maximum interest rates and fees. In addition to other federal laws, mortgage origination activities are subject to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth-in-Lending Act (“TILA”), Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”), and Home Ownership Equity Protection Act, and the regulations promulgated under these acts. These laws prohibit discrimination, require the disclosure of certain information to mortgagors concerning credit and settlement costs, limit payment for settlement services to the reasonable value of the services rendered and require the maintenance and disclosure of information regarding the disposition of mortgage applications based on race, gender, geographical distribution and income level. The Dodd-Frank Act has transferred rulemaking authority under many of these laws to the CFPB.
 
Compliance with the requirements of TILA, RESPA, and other federal and state laws and regulations (including regulations adopted by the CFPB) may require substantial investments in mortgage lending systems and processes and implementation efforts to respond to regulatory developments, all of which may impose significant costs on the Bank.  For example, compliance with the CFPB’s Integrated Mortgage Disclosure Rules under TILA and RESPA (or “TRID”), which became effective in October 2015, requires the Bank to implement at significant cost new systems and processes that will apply to most closed-end mortgage loans originated by the Bank.

The Bank’s mortgage origination activities are also subject to Regulation Z, which implements TILA. As amended and effective in January 2014, certain provisions of Regulation Z require mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination, based on verified and documented information, that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Alternatively, a mortgage lender can originate “qualified mortgages”, which are generally defined as mortgage loans without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, terms exceeding 30 years, and points and fees paid by a consumer equal to or less than 3% of the total loan amount. Higher-priced qualified mortgages (e.g., subprime loans) receive a rebuttable presumption of compliance with ability-to-repay rules, and other qualified mortgages (e.g., prime loans) are deemed to comply with the ability-to-repay rules. The Bank predominately originates mortgage loans that comply with Regulation Z’s “qualified mortgage” rules.
 
Consumer Protection
 
The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a federal regulatory agency that is responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws for institutions with more than $10 billion of assets and, to a lesser extent, smaller institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to supervise and regulate providers of consumer financial products and services, establishes the CFPB’s power to act against unfair, deceptive or abusive practices and gives the CFPB rulemaking authority in connection with numerous federal consumer financial protection laws (for example, but not limited to, TILA and RESPA).
 
As a smaller institution (i.e., with assets of $10 billion or less), most consumer protection aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to be applied to the Company and the Bank by the Federal Reserve Board. However, the CFPB may include its own examiners in regulatory examinations by a small institution’s prudential regulators and may require smaller institutions to comply with certain CFPB reporting requirements. In addition, regulatory positions taken by the CFPB and administrative and legal precedents established by CFPB enforcement activities, including in connection with supervision of larger bank holding companies, could influence how the Federal Reserve Board applies consumer protection laws and regulations to financial institutions that are not directly supervised by the CFPB. The precise impact of the CFPB’s consumer protection activities on the Company and the Bank cannot be determined with certainty. In 2016, the CFPB proposed rules that provide an exception to the requirement to deliver an annual privacy notice if a financial institution only provides nonpublic personal information to unaffiliated third parties under limited exceptions under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related regulations, and has not changed its policies and practices regarding disclosure of nonpublic personal financial information from those disclosed in the most recent privacy notice provided to the customer.
 
Confidentiality and Required Disclosures of Customer Information
 
The Company and the Bank are subject to various laws and regulations that address the privacy of nonpublic personal financial information of consumers. The GLBA and certain regulations issued thereunder protect against the transfer and use by financial institutions of consumer nonpublic personal information. A financial institution must provide to its customers, at the beginning of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution's policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers' nonpublic personal financial information. These privacy provisions generally prohibit a financial institution from providing a customer's personal financial information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that the information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure.
 
The Company and the Bank are also subject to various laws and regulations that attempt to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The Bank Secrecy Act requires all financial institutions to, among other things, create a system of controls designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and imposes recordkeeping and reporting requirements. The USA Patriot Act facilitates information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering, and requires financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) sends banking regulatory agencies lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities, and requests banks to search their records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists. If the Bank finds any relationships or transactions, it must file a suspicious activity report with the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) and contact the FBI. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), which is a division of the Treasury, is responsible for helping to ensure that United States entities do not engage in transactions with “enemies” of the United States, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. If the Bank finds a name of an “enemy” of the United States on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze such account or place transferred funds into a blocked account, file a suspicious activity report with the Treasury and notify the FBI.
 
Although these laws and programs impose compliance costs and create privacy obligations and, in some cases, reporting obligations, and compliance with all of the laws, programs and privacy and reporting obligations may require significant resources of the Company and the Bank, these laws and programs do not materially affect the Bank’s products, services or other business activities.

Community Reinvestment Act
 
The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) imposes on financial institutions an affirmative and ongoing obligation to meet the credit needs of their local communities, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. A financial institution’s efforts in meeting community credit needs are assessed based on specified factors. These factors also are considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. Following the Bank’s most recent scheduled compliance examination in July 2016, it received a CRA performance evaluation of “satisfactory.”
Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta
 
The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Atlanta, which is one of 12 regional FHLBs that provide funding to their members for making housing loans as well as for affordable housing and community development loans. Each FHLB serves as a reserve, or central bank, for the members within its assigned region. Each is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. Each FHLB makes loans to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB. As a member, the Bank must purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Atlanta. In 2004, the FHLB converted to its new capital structure, which established the minimum capital stock requirement for member banks as an amount equal to the sum of a membership requirement and an activity-based requirement. At December 31, 2016, the Bank held $8.5 million of FHLB of Atlanta stock.
Volcker Rule
 
The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances, and places limits on ownership of equity investments in private equity and hedge funds (the “Volcker Rule”). On December 10, 2013, the U.S. financial regulatory agencies (including the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the SEC) adopted final rules to implement the Volcker Rule. In relevant part, these final rules would have prohibited banking entities from owning collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) backed by trust preferred securities, effective July 21, 2015. However, subsequent to these final rules the U.S. financial regulatory agencies issued an interim rule effective April 1, 2014 to exempt CDOs backed by trust preferred securities from the Volcker Rule and the final rule, provided that (a) the CDO was established prior to May 19, 2010, (b) the banking entity reasonably believes that the CDO’s offering proceeds were used to invest primarily in trust preferred securities issued by banks with less than $15 billion in assets, and (iii) the banking entity acquired the CDO investment on or before December 10, 2013.
 
Smaller banks, with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or less, engaged in modest proprietary trading activities for their own accounts are subject to a simplified compliance program under the final rules. Several portions of the Volcker Rule remain subject to regulatory rulemaking and legislative activity, including to further delay effectiveness of some provisions of the Volcker Rule. The Company believes that its financial condition will not be significantly impacted by the Volcker Rule, and does not expect that any delays in the effectiveness of the Volcker Rule will significantly impact its financial condition.
 
Future Regulation
 
Including and in addition to the specific proposals described above, from time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations, regulatory policies or regulatory guidance or interpretative positions applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the business of the Company.
