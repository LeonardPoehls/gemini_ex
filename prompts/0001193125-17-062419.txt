Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 In 2015, the Board of Directors (Board) of Southwest Gas Corporation authorized management to evaluate and pursue a holding company reorganization to provide further separation between regulated and unregulated businesses, and to provide additional financing flexibility. As part of the holding company reorganization, Centuri Construction Group, Inc. (Centuri) and Southwest Gas Corporation would each be subsidiaries of the new publicly traded parent holding company, Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. (Southwest Gas Holdings); whereas, historically, Centuri had been a direct subsidiary of Southwest Gas Corporation. All of Southwest Gas Corporations outstanding debt securities (not associated with Centuri) at the time of the reorganization would remain at the Southwest Gas utility entity. Regulatory applications for preapproval of the reorganization were filed with the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC), the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), and the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (PUCN) in October 2015. Approvals were received from the CPUC, the PUCN, and the ACC in January, March, and May, respectively, of 2016. The reorganization, which was approved by the Board of Directors in December 2016, became effective in January 2017. Each outstanding share of Southwest Gas Corporations common stock automatically converted into a share of stock in Southwest Gas Holdings, on a one-for-one basis, and the ticker symbol of the stock, SWX, remains unchanged. This report is as of the balance sheet date of December 31, 2016 and periods up to that date (prior to the effective date of the holding company formation), with disclosures, where appropriate, for events following that date. Throughout this report, the Company refers to Southwest Gas Corporation and subsidiaries for periods prior to January 1, 2017 and to Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries for periods subsequent to December 31, 2016. 
 The Company was incorporated in March 1931 under the laws of the state of California. The Company is composed of two business segments: natural gas operations (Southwest or the natural gas operations segment) and construction services. 
 Southwest is engaged in the business of purchasing, distributing, and transporting natural gas for customers in portions of Arizona, Nevada, and California. Southwest is the largest distributor of natural gas in Arizona, selling and transporting natural gas in most of central and southern Arizona, including the Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas. Southwest is also the largest distributor of natural gas in Nevada, serving the Las Vegas metropolitan area and northern Nevada. In addition, Southwest distributes and transports natural gas for customers in portions of California, including the Lake Tahoe area and the high desert and mountain areas in San Bernardino County. 
 Centuri (the construction services segment), a 96.6% owned subsidiary of the Company, is a comprehensive construction services enterprise dedicated to meeting the growing demands of North American utilities, energy and industrial markets. Centuri derives revenue from installation, replacement, repair, and maintenance of energy distribution systems, and developing industrial construction solutions primarily for energy services utilities. Centuri operations are generally conducted under the business names of NPL Construction Co. (NPL), NPL Canada Ltd. (NPL Canada, formerly Link-Line Contractors Ltd.), W.S. Nicholls Construction, Inc. and related companies (W.S. Nicholls), and Brigadier Pipelines Inc. (Brigadier). In May 2016, Centuri completed the acquisition of two privately held, affiliated construction businesses: Enterprise Trenchless Technologies, Inc. and ETTI Holdings (collectively, ETTI). 
 Financial information concerning the Companys business segments is included in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in the 2016 Annual Report to Shareholders and is incorporated herein by reference.

NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS 
 General Description 
 Southwest is subject to regulation by the ACC, the PUCN, and the CPUC. These commissions regulate public utility rates, practices, facilities, and service territories in their respective states. The CPUC also regulates the issuance of all debt securities by Southwest, with the exception of short-term borrowings. Certain accounting practices, transmission facilities, and rates are subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Centuri is not regulated by the state utilities commissions or by the FERC in any of its operating areas. 
 As of December 31, 2016, Southwest purchased and distributed or transported natural gas to 1,984,000 residential, commercial, and industrial customers in geographically diverse portions of Arizona, Nevada, and California. Southwest added 28,000 net new customers during 2016. Southwest expects similar customer growth in 2017. 
 The table below lists the percentage of operating margin (operating revenues less net cost of gas) by major customer class for the years indicated: 
 

For the Year Ended | | Distribution | | Transportation
 | Residential andSmall Commercial | | Other SalesCustomers | 
December 31, 2016 | | 85% | | 3% | 12%
December 31, 2015 | | 85% | | 4% | 11%
December 31, 2014 | | 85% | | 4% | 11%

 Southwest is not dependent on any one or a few customers such that the loss of any one or several would have a significant adverse impact on earnings or cash flows. See Risk Factors below regarding impacts in the event of loss of significant customers in the construction services segment. 
 Transportation of customer-secured gas to end-users accounted for 47% of total system throughput in 2016, but only 12% of operating margin as shown in the table above. Customers who utilized this service transported 97 million dekatherms in 2016, 104 million dekatherms in 2015, and 91 million dekatherms in 2014. 
 The demand for natural gas is seasonal, with greater demand in the colder winter months and decreased demand in the warmer summer months. It is the opinion of management that comparisons of earnings for interim periods do not reliably reflect overall trends and changes in operations. The decoupled rate mechanisms in place in the three-state service territory are structured with seasonal variations. Also, earnings for interim periods can be significantly affected by the timing of general rate relief. 
 Rates and Regulation 
 Rates that Southwest is authorized to charge its distribution system customers are determined by the ACC, PUCN, and CPUC in general rate cases and are derived using rate base, cost of service, and cost of capital experienced in an historical test year, as adjusted in Arizona and Nevada, and projected for a future test year in California. The FERC regulates the northern Nevada transmission and liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage facilities of Paiute Pipeline Company (Paiute), a wholly owned subsidiary, and the rates it charges for transportation of gas directly to certain end-users and to various local distribution companies (LDCs). The LDCs transporting on the Paiute system are: NV Energy (serving Reno and Sparks, Nevada) and Southwest (serving Truckee, South and North Lake Tahoe in California and various locations throughout northern Nevada). 
 Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class and rate jurisdiction and are set at levels that are intended to allow for the recovery of all prudently incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt as well as a reasonable return on common equity. Rate base consists generally of the original cost of utility plant in service net of amounts associated with costs borne by third parties, plus certain other assets such as working capital and inventories, less accumulated depreciation on utility plant in service, net deferred income tax liabilities, and certain other deductions. 
 Rate structures in all service territories allow Southwest to separate or decouple the recovery of operating margin from natural gas consumption, though decoupled structures (alternative revenue programs), vary by state. In California, authorized operating margin levels vary by month. In Nevada, a decoupled rate structure applies to most customer classes providing stability in annual operating margin. In Arizona, a full revenue decoupling mechanism (currently, with a winter-period monthly weather adjuster) is in place for most customer classes. 
 
2 
 
Rate schedules in all service areas contain deferred energy or purchased gas adjustment provisions, which allow Southwest to file for rate adjustments as the cost of purchased gas changes. Deferred energy and purchased gas adjustment (collectively PGA) rate changes affect cash flows, but have no direct impact on profit margin. Filings to change rates in accordance with PGA clauses are subject to audit by the appropriate state regulatory commission staff. 
 Information with respect to recent general rate cases and PGA filings is included in the Rates and Regulatory Proceedings section of Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) in the 2016 Annual Report to Shareholders. 
 The table below lists recent docketed general rate filings and the status of such filing within each ratemaking area: 
 

Ratemaking Area | Type of Filing | Month Filed | Month Final Rates Effective

Paiute | General rate case | February 2014 | February 2015 

 While Southwest is subject to regulatory rules and oversight with regard to rates and operating requirements under its various state tariffs (and federal tariff, in the case of Paiute Pipeline), it is also subject to regulation with regard to the safety and integrity of its pipeline systems. The Department of Transportation (DOT) administers pipeline regulations through the Office of Pipeline Safety, within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). In recent years, various pieces of legislation have been passed in the areas of distribution pipeline integrity, control room management, and pipeline safety. The Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety (PIPES) Act of 2006 mandated, among other things, a graduated implementation program for control room management, a requirement to install excess flow valves on single-family residential customer locations, and a Distribution Integrity Management Program (DIMP), which was required to be in place by August 2011, and includes evaluation and mitigation of risks, as well as certain reporting requirements. Additionally, Congress passed the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the Bill), effective January 2012, which increased/strengthened previously existing safety requirements, including damage prevention programs, penalty provisions, and requirements related to automatic and remote-controlled shut-off valves, public awareness programs, incident notification, and maximum allowable operating pressure for certain facilities. The Bill required the DOT to conduct further study of existing programs and future requirements; these studies are nearing their completion and proposed regulation changes are anticipated in some form in 2017/2018. The PHMSA is in the process of proposing a series of significant rulemakings that are expected to further transform the regulatory requirements for pipelines. In October 2016, PHMSA issued a final rule regarding expanding the use of excess flow valves in natural gas distribution systems. The new rule has an effective date of April 2017. Southwest continues to evaluate potential impacts of this regulation on its operations and customers. Southwest continues to monitor changing pipeline safety legislation and participates to the extent possible in developing associated mandates and reporting requirements. Additionally, it works with its state and federal commissions, where possible, to develop customer rates that are responsive to incremental costs of compliance. However, due to the timing of when rates are implemented in response to new requirements, and as additional rules are developed, compliance requirements could impact expenses and the timing and amount of capital expenditures. 
 Demand for Natural Gas 
 Deliveries of natural gas by Southwest are made under a priority system established by state regulatory commissions. The priority system is intended to ensure that the gas requirements of higher-priority customers, primarily residential customers and other customers who use 500 therms or less of gas per day, are fully satisfied on a daily basis before lower-priority customers, primarily electric utility and large industrial customers able to use alternative fuels, are provided any quantity of gas or capacity. 
 Demand for natural gas is greatly affected by temperature. On cold days, use of gas by residential and commercial customers can be as much as seven times greater than on warm days because of increased use of gas for space heating. To fully satisfy this increased high-priority demand, gas is withdrawn from storage in certain service areas, or peaking supplies are purchased from suppliers. If necessary, service to interruptible lower-priority customers may be curtailed to provide the needed delivery system capacity. Southwest maintains no significant backlog on its orders for gas service.

Natural Gas Supply 
 Southwest is responsible for acquiring and arranging delivery of natural gas to its system in sufficient quantities to meet its sales customers needs. Southwests primary natural gas procurement objective is to ensure that adequate supplies of natural gas are available at a reasonable cost. Southwest acquires natural gas from a wide variety of sources and a mix of purchase provisions, which includes spot market and firm supplies. The purchases may have terms from one day to several years and utilize both fixed and indexed pricing. During 2016, Southwest acquired natural gas from 40 suppliers. Southwest regularly monitors the number of suppliers, their performance, and their relative contribution to the overall customer supply portfolio. New suppliers are contracted when possible, and solicitations for supplies are extended to the largest practicable list of suppliers, taking into account each suppliers creditworthiness. Competitive pricing, flexibility in meeting Southwests requirements, and demonstrated reliability of service are instrumental to any one suppliers inclusion in Southwests portfolio. The goal of this practice is to mitigate the risk of nonperformance by any one supplier and ensure competitive prices in the portfolio. 
 Balancing reliability with supply cost results in a continually changing mix of purchase provisions within the supply portfolios. To address the unique requirements of its various market areas, Southwest assembles and administers a separate natural gas supply portfolio for each of its jurisdictional areas. Southwest facilitates most natural gas purchases through competitive bid processes. 
 To mitigate customer exposure to short-term market price volatility, Southwest seeks to fix the price on a portion (up to 25% in the Arizona and California jurisdictions) of its forecasted annual normal-weather volume requirement, primarily using firm, fixed-price purchasing arrangements that are secured periodically throughout the year. Southwests price volatility mitigation program includes the use of financial derivatives, in the form of fixed-for-floating-index-price swaps combined with indexed-price physical purchases, to secure a portion of the fixed-price portfolio for the Arizona rate jurisdiction. The combination of fixed-price contracts and financial derivatives is designed to increase flexibility for Southwest and increase supplier diversification. The cost of such financial derivatives combined with the associated indexed-price physical purchases is recovered from customers through the PGA mechanism. 
 In late 2013, the utilization of fixed-for-floating-index-price swaps and fixed-price purchases pursuant to the Volatility Mitigation Program (VMP) was suspended for the Nevada territories served by Southwest. Management evaluates, on a quarterly basis, the suspension of Nevada VMP purchases in light of prevailing market fundamentals and regulatory conditions. Any future decision concerning Nevada VMP purchases will be documented and retained to facilitate regulatory review in accordance with a previous regulatory stipulation. Southwest schedules quarterly meetings with the PUCN Staff and the Bureau of Consumer Protection to discuss market fundamentals, along with any decision by management concerning VMP purchases for the Nevada service territories. 
 For the 2016/2017 heating season, fixed-price physical commodity purchases ranged from approximately $2.65 to approximately $4.15 per dekatherm. Southwest makes non-fixed-price natural gas purchases under variable-price contracts with firm quantities or on the spot market. Prices for these contracts are determined at the beginning of each month to reflect that months published first-of-month index price or based on a published daily price index. These monthly or daily index prices are not published or known until the purchase period begins. 
 The firm natural gas supply arrangements are structured such that a stated volume of natural gas is required to be nominated by Southwest and delivered by the supplier. Contracts provide for fixed or market-based penalties to be paid by the non-performing party. 
 Storage availability can influence the average annual price of natural gas, as storage allows a company to purchase natural gas quantities during the off-peak season and store it for use in high demand periods when prices may be greater or supplies/capacity tighter. Southwest currently has no storage availability in its southern Nevada rate jurisdiction. Limited storage availability exists in southern and northern California, northern Nevada, and the Arizona rate jurisdiction. 
 Southwest has a contract with Southern California Gas Company that is intended for delivery only within Southwests southern California rate jurisdiction. In addition, contracts with Paiute for its LNG facility allow for peaking capability only in northern Nevada and northern California. For all storage options, Southwest purchases natural gas for injection during the off-peak period for use in the high demand months, but these supplies have a limited impact on the overall price. 
 Southwest also has interruptible storage contracts with Northwest Pipeline Corporation (NWPL) for the northern Nevada and northern California rate jurisdictions. NWPL has the discretion to limit Southwests ability to inject or withdraw 
 
4 
 
 from this interruptible storage, which consequently limits Southwests use of this interruptible storage capacity. As such, this storage provides limited operational flexibility to adjust daily flowing supplies to meet demand, and has limited impact on the overall price of natural gas supplies. 
 Southwest also has an agreement for its Arizona rate jurisdiction with Enstor Grama Ridge Storage and Transportation, LLC (Enstor) which provides for a maximum quantity of 600,000 dekatherms of natural gas underground storage in New Mexico that is deliverable on the El Paso system. Southwest previously received approval to construct, operate and maintain a 233,000 dekatherm LNG facility in southern Arizona. This facility is intended to enhance service reliability and flexibility in natural gas deliveries in the southern Arizona area by providing a local storage option, operated by Southwest and connected directly to its distribution system. The site for the facility was purchased in October 2015. Southwest solicited requests for proposals for the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) phase of the project, and in October 2016 made a filing with the ACC to modify the previously issued Order to update the pre-approved costs to reflect a not-to-exceed amount of $80 million, which is intended to update the pre-approval to reflect the current pricing information made available through the recently completed EPC phase. The filing was approved by the ACC in December 2016. Through December 2016, Southwest has incurred approximately $4.1 million in capital expenditures toward the project (including land acquisition costs). Southwest included a proposal for the ratemaking treatment of facility costs as part of its current Arizona rate case filing. A settlement (contingent on ACC approval) in the general rate case was reached between several parties at a December 2016 settlement meeting and a formal draft settlement was filed with the ACC in January 2017. The draft settlement included an agreement to defer the revenue requirement associated with all costs incurred before December 31, 2020 for recovery in Southwests next general rate case proceeding and extended the authorization to defer costs through the same date. Any gas costs incurred that are not related to the initial construction and placement of the facility are to be recovered through the PGA mechanism. Construction is expected to be completed by the end of 2019. 
 Natural gas supplies for Southwests southern system (Arizona, southern Nevada, and southern California properties) are primarily obtained from producing regions in Colorado and New Mexico (San Juan basin), Texas (Permian basin), and Rocky Mountain areas. For its northern system (northern Nevada and northern California properties), Southwest primarily obtains natural gas from Rocky Mountain producing areas and from Canada. 
 The landscape for national natural gas supply is continuously changing. Advanced drilling techniques continue to provide access to abundant and sustainable natural gas supplies. The natural gas market has responded to the abundant supply of natural gas with reductions to both price volatility and the total price of the commodity. Forecasts show that an ample and diverse natural gas supply is available to Southwests customers at a highly competitive price when compared with competing forms of energy. 
 Southwest arranges for transportation of natural gas to its Arizona, Nevada, and California service territories through the pipeline systems of El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), Kern River Gas Transmission Company (Kern River), Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern), NWPL, Tuscarora Gas Pipeline Company (Tuscarora), Southern California Gas Company, and Paiute. Southwest regularly monitors short- and long-term supply and pipeline capacity availability to ensure the reliability of service to its customers. Southwest currently receives firm transportation service, both on a short- and long-term basis, for all of its service territories on the pipeline systems noted above. Southwest also contracts for firm natural gas supplies that are delivered to Southwests city gates to supplement its firm capacity on the interstate pipelines and to meet projected peak-day demands. Southwest could also utilize its interruptible contracts on the interstate pipelines for the transportation of additional natural gas supplies. 
 Southwest believes that the current levels of contracted firm interstate capacity and delivered purchases are sufficient to serve each of its service territories forecasted peak-day requirements. As the need arises to acquire additional capacity on one of the interstate pipeline transmission systems, primarily due to customer growth, Southwest will continue to consider available options to obtain that capacity, either through the use of firm contracts with a pipeline company, by purchasing capacity on the open market, or through the purchase of firm delivered natural gas supplies. 
 Competition 
 Electric utilities are the principal competitors of Southwest for the residential and small commercial markets throughout its service areas. Competition for space heating, general household, and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation phase when the customer/builder typically makes the decision as to which type of equipment to install and operate. The customer will generally continue to use the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment. Southwest interfaces directly with the various home builders and commercial property developers in its service territories to ensure that natural gas appliances are considered in new developments and commercial centers. As a result of its efforts, 
 
5 
 
 Southwest has continued to experience growth in the new construction market among residential and small commercial customer classes. 
 Unlike residential and small commercial customers, certain large commercial, industrial, and electric generation customers have the capability to switch to alternative energy sources. To date, Southwest has been successful in retaining most of these customers by setting rates (subject to conditions of the respective state tariffs) at levels competitive with commercially available alternative energy sources such as electricity, fuel oils, and coal. However, high natural gas prices can impact Southwests ability to retain some of these customers. Overall, management does not anticipate any material adverse impact on operating margin from fuel switching by these large customers. 
 Southwest competes with interstate transmission pipeline companies, such as El Paso, Kern River, Transwestern and Tuscarora, to provide service to certain large end-users. End-use customers located in proximity to these interstate pipelines pose a potential bypass threat. Southwest attempts to closely monitor each customer situation and provide competitive service in order to retain the customer. Southwest has remained competitive through the use of negotiated transportation contract rates (subject to conditions of the respective state tariffs), special long-term contracts with electric generation and cogeneration customers, and other tariff programs. These competitive response initiatives have mitigated the loss of margin earned from large customers. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment have a direct impact upon Southwest. Environmental efforts, with respect to matters such as storm water management, emissions of air pollutants, hazardous material management, protection of endangered species and archeological resources, directly impact the complexity and time required to obtain pipeline rights-of-way and construction permits. However, increased environmental legislation and regulation can also be beneficial to the natural gas industry. Natural gas is one of the most environmentally-friendly fossil fuels currently available and its use can help energy users to comply with stricter environmental air quality standards. 
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the State of California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal/EPA) have issued regulations that require the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from large sources and suppliers in order to facilitate the development of policies and programs to reduce GHGs. Southwest reports required information to the EPA and Cal/EPA under respective rules including the volumes of natural gas that it receives for distribution to LDC customers, and the GHG emissions that result from the operation of its LDC pipelines. While some aspects of the mandatory reporting rules do not apply to Southwest, other required information is being reported to the Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation, or is available in existing databases. Management also monitors the development of climate legislation (including the State of California Global Warming Solutions Act), which could result in additional requirements or have financial implications. 
 California Assembly Bill Number 32 and the regulations promulgated by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), require Southwest, as a covered entity, to comply with all of the requirements associated with the California GHG Emissions Reporting Program and the California Cap and Trade Program. The objective of these programs is to reduce California statewide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Southwest must report annual GHG emissions by April of each year and third-party verification of those reported amounts is required by September of each year. Starting in 2015, the CARB annually allocates to Southwest a certain number of allowances based on Southwests reported 2011 GHG emissions. Southwest received its allocation for 2016 in the third quarter of 2015 and, for 2017, in the third quarter of 2016. Of those allocated allowances, Southwest must consign a certain percentage to the CARB for auction. Southwest can use any allocated allowances that remain after consignment, along with allowances it can purchase through CARB auctions or reserve sales, or through over the counter (OTC) purchases with other market participants, to meet its compliance obligations. In addition to allowances, Southwest can satisfy a portion of its compliance obligation through the purchase of offsets, which are credits available in the OTC market from industries that generate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. 
 There are two triennial compliance periods; one ending in 2017 and the other ending in 2020. To meet its compliance obligations, during each triennial compliance period, Southwest must surrender a combination of allowances and offsets equal to 30% of its annual reported GHG emissions for the prior year by November 1 of each year (2016 through 2020). Also by November 1 of the year following each of the triennial compliance periods (2018 and 2021), Southwest must surrender a sufficient number of allowances and offsets to meet the amount of GHG emissions reported during that triennial compliance period, less the amount previously surrendered.

The CPUC has issued a decision that provides for the regulatory treatment of the program costs and there is no expected impact on earnings. 
 Employees 
 At December 31, 2016, Southwest had 2,247 regular full-time equivalent employees. Southwest believes it has a good relationship with its employees and that compensation, benefits, and working conditions afforded its employees are comparable to those generally found in the utility industry. No employees are represented by a union. 
CONSTRUCTION SERVICES 
 Centuri is a comprehensive construction services enterprise dedicated to meeting the growing demands of North American utilities, energy and industrial markets. Centuri derives revenue from installation, replacement, repair, and maintenance of energy distribution systems, and developing industrial construction solutions primarily for energy services utilities. Centuri contracts primarily with LDCs to install, repair, and maintain energy distribution systems from the town border station to the end-user. The primary focus of Centuri operations is distribution pipe and service hook-up replacements as well as line installations for new business development. Construction work varies from relatively small projects to the piping of entire communities. Construction activity is seasonal in most areas. Peak construction periods are the summer and fall months in colder climate areas, such as the North East, Midwest, and Canada. In the warmer climate areas, such as the southwestern United States, construction continues year round. 
 During the past few years, several factors have resulted in an increase in large multi-year distribution pipe replacement projects. The U.S. Department of Transportations PHMSA instituted DIMP which required operators of gas distribution pipelines to develop and implement integrity management programs to enhance safety by identifying and reducing pipeline integrity risks. Also contributing to the increase in replacement projects were bonus depreciation tax deduction incentives. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 extended 50% bonus depreciation tax deduction incentives through 2017 and at lesser rates through 2019. Finally, funding for customers planned replacement projects improved due to greater access to credit markets. 
 In connection with the increased construction activity, several large multi-year distribution pipe replacement projects were awarded to Centuri. Centuri was selected as the sole contractor on certain of these projects, or one of several contractors to work on others. Centuri continues to bid on pipe replacement projects throughout the United States and Canada and has made structural and transitional changes to match the increased size and complexity of the business. The amount of work completed by Centuri on these multi-year contracts will vary from year to year. 
 Centuris business activities are often concentrated in utility service territories where existing energy lines are scheduled for replacement. An LDC will typically contract with Centuri to provide pipe replacement services and new line installations. Contract terms generally specify unit-price or fixed-price arrangements. Unit-price contracts establish prices for all of the various services to be performed during the contract period. These contracts often have annual pricing reviews. During 2016, approximately 86% of revenue was earned under unit-price contracts. As of December 31, 2016, a backlog of approximately $88 million existed with respect to outstanding fixed-priced construction contracts. 
 Materials used by Centuri in its construction activities are typically specified, purchased, and supplied by Centuris customers. Construction contracts also contain provisions which make customers generally liable for remediating environmental hazards encountered during the construction process. Such hazards might include digging in an area that was contaminated prior to construction, finding endangered animals, digging in historically significant sites, etc. Otherwise, Centuris operations have limited environmental impact (dust control, normal waste disposal, handling harmful materials, etc.). 
 Competition within the industry has traditionally been limited to several regional and numerous local competitors in what has been a largely fragmented industry. Some national competitors also exist within the industry. Centuri currently operates in 20 major markets within the United States and also within the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Ontario. Its customers are primarily the principal LDCs in those markets. During 2015, Centuri served over 100 customers, with Southwest accounting for approximately 9% of total revenues. Additionally, two customers combined accounted for approximately 24% of total revenue, while four other customers individually accounted for 5% or more of total revenue.

Employment fluctuates between seasonal construction periods, which are normally heaviest in the summer and fall months. At December 31, 2016, Centuri had 4,030 regular full-time equivalent employees. Employment peaked in September 2016 when there were 5,938 employees. Most employees are represented by unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements, which is typical of the utility construction industry. 
 Centuris operations are conducted from 24 field locations throughout the United States and 12 field locations within Canada, with corporate headquarters located in Phoenix, Arizona. Buildings and equipment storage yards are normally leased from third parties. The lease terms are typically five years or less. 
 Centuri is not directly affected by regulations promulgated by the ACC, PUCN, CPUC, or FERC. Centuri is an unregulated subsidiary of the Company. However, because Centuri performs work for Southwest, its associated construction costs are subject indirectly to prudency reviews just as any other capital work that is performed by third parties or directly by Southwest. However, such prudency reviews would not bring Centuri under the regulatory jurisdiction of any of the commissions noted above. 
 Centuri has a 65% interest in IntelliChoice Energy, LLC (ICE) and consolidates ICE as a majority owned subsidiary. ICE was established in 2009 and markets natural gas engine-driven heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) technology and products. To date, ICE has not been a significant component of Centuri operating results. 
 Centuri, through its subsidiaries, holds a 50% interest in W.S. Nicholls Western Construction LTD. (Western), a Canadian construction services company that is a variable interest entity that specializes in construction of underground aviation fueling systems and storage tanks. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of Western; therefore, Western is not consolidated with Centuri and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Furthermore, Centuri, through its subsidiaries, also has a 25% interest in CCI-TBN Toronto, Inc., and a 50% interest in Matheson-Nicholls Joint Venture, subject to equity method accounting as well. To date, neither Western, CCI-TBN Toronto, Inc., nor Matheson-Nicholls Joint Venture have been a significant component of Centuris financial results.
