Item 1. Business.
Web.com Group, Inc. (referred to as "we", “the Company”, “Web.com Group, Inc.” or “Web.com” herein) provides a full range of Internet services to small businesses to help them compete and succeed online. Web.com meets the needs of small businesses anywhere along their lifecycle with affordable, subscription-based solutions including domains, hosting, website design and management, search engine optimization, online marketing campaigns, local sales leads, social media, mobile products and eCommerce solutions. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, Web.com is a publicly traded company (NASDAQ: WEB) serving approximately 3.5 million customers, primarily in North America, with approximately 3,600 employees in North America, South America and the United Kingdom.
Web.com was incorporated under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware on March 2, 1999 as Website Pros, Inc. We offered common stock to the public for the first time on November 1, 2005 as Website Pros (NASDAQ: WSPI) and began trading as Web.com (NASDAQ: WWWW) following our acquisition of the legacy Web.com business in September 2007. On November 9, 2015, the Company changed its trading symbol from WWWW to WEB, which continues to be traded on the NASDAQ. 
In March 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Yodle, Inc., a Delaware corporation, ("Yodle"). Yodle provides cloud-based local marketing solutions for small businesses with approximately 1,400 employees and 53,000 subscribers, which are reflected in the above headcount and customer totals. With the Yodle platform, we are able to provide our customers with an online, mobile and social presence and automate, manage and optimize our customers' marketing activities and other consumer interactions. Yodle's solutions are highly integrated and designed to be easy-to-use, helping businesses navigate the rapidly evolving, technologically challenging and highly fragmented digital marketing landscape without having to invest a significant amount of time and money. 
On January 31, 2017, Web.com acquired DonWeb.com, located in Rosario, Argentina and is a web hosting and domain registration company catering to the Latin American market. 
Market Opportunity
Web.com's focus is to help small businesses succeed online. Small business owners, including sole proprietors, have limited support staff and must devote most of their time to running the daily operations of their businesses. They often have limited knowledge of how to build a web presence and market their online businesses and limited time to acquire the skills to do so. At the same time, there is growing acceptance among these small business owners that an effective Internet presence is critical to their marketing efforts and there is evidence that these businesses are shifting their marketing budgets from traditional media to online channels.

What We Do 
Using a consultative approach, Web.com offers small businesses one-stop shopping for an array of effective, affordable online products and services that will help drive their businesses. We have positioned ourselves as a partner to small businesses across all phases of their adoption of Internet marketing, from their initial entry onto the web to more advanced online marketing solutions. As a global domain registrar, we enable small businesses to establish an online presence by buying a domain name. This basic service is the entry point to greater value-added offerings, which span the range of customer budgets and expertise, from inexpensive Do-It-Yourself ("DIY") websites and hosting to Do-It-For-Me ("DIFM") custom website design services, online marketing, social media and eCommerce solutions for those needing full service. We further differentiate our DIY offerings with a modified approach to the market, which is called "Do-It-With-Me" ("DIWM"), which provides our DIY customers with an opportunity to speak and work with us via chat, email or telephone while they are building their websites. We are frequently the technology enabler between small businesses and Internet innovators such as Google and Facebook, allowing the small business customer to take advantage of today’s online and social media outreach.
Through the combination of proprietary software, automated work flow processes, and specialized and high quality workforce development and management techniques, Web.com achieves production efficiencies that enable us to offer sophisticated web services at affordable, monthly subscription rates. 
Our Services and Products
Our goal is to provide a broad range of web services and products that enable small businesses to establish, maintain, promote, and optimize their online presence. Customers can subscribe to bundled products that meet a variety of needs, and which can be enhanced with additional services. Alternatively, they can choose to purchase ‘a la carte’ solutions for specific solutions.
As our customers demand more advanced products and consultative services, they move from low-priced domain registrations towards high-priced, value-added offerings. These DIFM offerings have relatively high barriers to entry, as they require sophisticated technological and business-process expertise. We are unique in having deployed our feature-rich DIFM website offerings at an unrivaled scale.
The acquisition of Yodle in March of 2016 brings vertically focused solutions that help small businesses attract new business and retain existing customers through cloud-based marketing platforms and that complement our service and product offerings. 
Domain Name Registration and Services
We are one of the largest domain name registrars in the world and offer .com and .net domains as well as the latest top-level domains. We also offer a full suite of domain name services, including domain name registration, transfers, renewals, expiration protection and privacy services. Domain name customers have a highly proprietary need to maintain their distinct Internet address, and our goal is to continue to be their resource for maintaining and extending their registration. Furthermore, these customers represent prime opportunities for more domain name sales, particularly as additional top-level domain names become available. Since online activity typically starts with a domain name, we anticipate continuing to be a market leader in selling and servicing these accounts.
Do-It-For-Me Web Solutions 
We created these services to allow Web.com to undertake virtually all of the work associated with building, maintaining, marketing and enhancing a business online to ultimately drive leads to the small business owner. Since access to these services is through an affordable monthly subscription, these proprietors can have an effective online presence with a minimum outlay of resources. We bundle the most needed products in an efficient manner so the small business owner can focus on his or her core business while the responsibility for making sure the website is optimized for business generation is outsourced to Web.com. Some of our DIFM solutions include:

• | Custom Website. A custom website with built-in marketing, analytics and hosting.


• | Ignite. Enables websites to be promoted in dozens of major directories.


• | Facebook. Design or update our customers' Business Profile page on Facebook including advertising and postings.

Online Marketing Services
Business success on the Internet begins with a compelling website, but is only fully realized when the website is “found,” prominently displayed by the various search engines, and ultimately when potential customers are motivated to contact the business. We sell a variety of products and services designed to increase the potential that a website receives prominence in the major search engines like Google TM , Yahoo! and Bing, and we have expertise in providing pay-per-click advertising as well. Our online marketing proficiency has been recognized by our selection as a Google Premier Partner and as a Yahoo! Local Ambassador. Some of our online marketing products include:

When prospects search for a service, they are driven to a lead generation site to request a quote, and then leads are delivered to the subscriber’s computer or phone for follow up.


• | Renovation Experts. Premium lead generation service specific to contractors, homebuilders and remodeling professionals. We provide a competitive marketplace that matches homeowners in need of remodeling services with qualified contractors in their local area.

Sales Channels
The sales organization for our web services and products comprises several distinct sales channels, including:
Online. We primarily promote our services through the Web.com, Network Solutions.com, Yodle.com and Register.com websites. To drive potential customers to these sites, we engage in online marketing and advertising campaigns, and participate in seminars targeting small businesses that wish to sell their services online. Our partners also promote our services by including our products on their websites and by including services in their ongoing marketing and promotional efforts with their customers.
Outbound and Inbound Telesales. We utilize our telesales organization to cross-sell and up-sell our full product offerings to our entire customer base. In addition, we target customer lists provided by companies with which we have strategic marketing relationships. We believe that the relationships our customers have with their strategic partners enhances the ability to reach a decision maker, make a presentation, have our offer considered, and close the sale during the initial call. In addition, we maintain a separate team of sales specialists specifically focused on responding to inbound inquiries generated by programs initiated by the company and its strategic marketing partners through a mix of e-mail, direct mail, website, direct response television (DRTV) and other marketing efforts to help promote services to prospective customers.
Direct Response Television and Radio. We often promote Do-It-For-Me products through television and radio advertising campaigns. In addition to legacy ads supporting our Custom Website and Facebook TM by Web.com solutions, we sometimes use branded DRTV spots, which describe us and feature real customers who have derived significant business value from our solutions. We expect the level of spending in this sales channel to decrease in 2017 as we have decreased our focus in this sales channel.
Local Direct Sales. We have a local sales initiative in approximately 20 geographic markets throughout the United States, and expect to expand our penetration by expanding our inside sales organization to complement the markets where we do not have a physical presence. Our local sales teams are equipped to sell a full complement of solutions including Leads by Web, Custom Website Design, Social Media and Paid Search programs. 
Branding. In 2012, we entered a 10-year agreement to become the umbrella sponsor of the renamed Web.com Tour (formerly the Nationwide Tour), and an official marketing partner of the PGA TOUR. As a sponsor, our brand name has gained heightened visibility, and we believe this relationship will help us reach our target market of small business owners. In addition, in many Web.com Tour, PGA TOUR, and Champions Tour markets we have hosted free, small educational seminars designed to help small businesses learn how to be successful on the Internet as part of an initiative to bring additional benefit to communities where events are held, which in turn helps reach more of our target market. 
Reseller, Affiliate Network and Private Label Partners. We have developed affiliate partners and resellers who sell our services and provide additional opportunities to up-sell and cross-sell Do-It-For-Me services. We have worked closely with these resellers to develop sales support and fulfillment processes that integrate with the resellers’ sales, service, support, and billing practices. We provide ongoing marketing and technical support for our partners to ensure a positive customer experience for their end customers. Additionally, we provide these resellers with training and sales materials to support the web services being offered.
Multi-location/Franchise Sales.  We have a sales channel that targets franchise networks and corporations.  These businesses are unique because they have a corporate organization that is affiliated with a network of small, local businesses or divisions.  Our sales resources in this channel are dedicated to selling to both the corporate entity and into individual locations, like franchisees, in the network.
Marketing
Our marketing activities are principally focused on acquiring new subscribers and promoting additional products and services to our existing customers. Our marketing activities include:

• | Websites: Web.com, NetworkSolutions.com, Register.com, Leads.com, Leads by Web.com, 1ShoppingCart.com, RenovationExperts.com, SolidCactus.com, Submitawebsite.com, Scoot.co.uk, and Snapnames.com;

•Search engine and other online advertising;
•Targeted e-mail and direct response campaigns to prospects and customers; 
•Affiliate programs; and
•Sponsorships.

Customers
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 3.5 million customers. We generally target small businesses with less than 20 employees. We seek to create long-term relationships with these businesses by helping them leverage the Internet as a channel to promote and grow their business. 
Data Security
We maintain major operational facilities in Jacksonville, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Herndon, Virginia; New York, New York; Spokane, Washington; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Barrie, Ontario; New Glasgow, Nova Scotia; and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia for most of our internal operations. These facilities are monitored through our redundant Network Operations Centers (NOC); which are staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The servers that provide our customers’ website data to the Internet are located within third-party co-location facilities in Jacksonville, Florida and Atlanta, Georgia. We are in the process of migrating the legacy Yodle co-location centers into our Atlanta and Jacksonville co-locations. These co-location facilities have a secured network infrastructure including intrusion detection at the router level, full network traffic monitoring, end point monitoring, data collection and event reporting. Our contract obligates our co-location provider to provide us a secured space within their overall data center. The facilities are secured through card-key numeric entry and biometric access. Infrared detectors are used throughout the facility. In addition, the co-location facilities are staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with experts to manage and monitor the carrier networks and network access. The co-location facilities also provide multiple Internet carriers to help ensure bandwidth is available to our customers. The availability of electric power at the co-location facilities is provided through multiple uninterruptible power supply and generator systems should power supply fail at any of our major facilities.
Customer data is redundant through the use of multiple application and web servers. Customer data is backed up to other disk arrays with fail-over to help ensure high availability. Customer data is also maintained at our national design center and can be republished from archival data at any time. Currently, this process could take approximately 24 hours. Our financial system reporting also uses redundant systems and can be reconstituted in approximately 12 hours. Our customer data is stored on systems that are compliant and certified to meet CISP and PCI security standards. Furthermore, we have a highly available redundant infrastructure, which provides disaster recovery backup to prevent a disruption to our customers.
We continue to work on plans to provide active load balancing and built in disaster-recovery operations between our Atlanta and Jacksonville co-location sites. Under this scenario, a full copy of data would be backed up at each site. Each co-location site would provide fail-over capability for the other to prevent a disruption of our customers’ websites should either co-location site become unavailable.
Competition
The market for web services is highly competitive and evolving. We expect competition to increase from existing competitors as well as new market entrants. Most existing competitors typically offer a limited number of specialized solutions and services, but may provide a more comprehensive set of services in the future. These competitors include, among others, website designers, domain name registrars, Internet service providers, Internet search engine providers, local business directory providers, eCommerce service providers, lead generation companies and hosting companies. Some of the companies we compete with are: GoDaddy, Wix.com, Ltd., 1&1 Internet and Endurance International Group. Some of our competitors have greater resources, more brand recognition, larger installed bases of customers than we do, and we cannot ensure that we will be able to compete favorably against them or our other competitors.
We believe the principal competitive factors in the small business segment of the web services, online marketing and lead generation industry include:

• | Value, breadth and flexibility of service offerings;


• | Proprietary workflow processes and customer relationship management software;


• | Brand name and reputation;


• | Price;


• | Quality of customer support;


• | Speed of customer service;


• | Ease of implementation, use and maintenance;


• | Industry expertise and focus; and


• | Trade shows.

Intellectual Property
Our success and ability to compete is dependent in significant part on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We currently rely primarily on a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 49 issued U.S. patents. We also have several additional patent applications pending but not yet issued. 
Due to the rapidly changing nature of applicable technologies, we believe that the improvement of existing offerings, reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how, and development of new offerings generally will continue to be our principal source of proprietary protection. While we have hired third-party contractors to help develop our software and design websites, we own the intellectual property created by these contractors. Our software is not substantially dependent on any third-party software, although our software does utilize open source code. Notwithstanding the use of this open source code, we do not believe our usage requires public disclosure of our own source code nor do we believe the use of open source code is material to our business.
We also have an ongoing service mark and trademark registration program pursuant to which we register some of our product names, slogans and logos in the United States and in some foreign countries. License agreements for our software include restrictions intended to protect our intellectual property. These licenses are generally non-transferable and are perpetual. In addition, we require all of our employees, contractors and many of those with whom we have business relationships to sign non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements and to assign to us in writing all inventions created while working for us. Some of our products also include third-party software that we obtain the rights to use through license agreements. In such cases, we have the right to distribute or sublicense the third-party software with our products.
We have entered into confidentiality and other agreements with our employees and contractors. We have also entered into nondisclosure agreements with suppliers, distributors and some customers to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. Nonetheless, neither the intellectual property laws nor contractual arrangements, nor any of the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property can ensure that others will not use our technology or that others will not develop similar technologies.
We license or lease from others, many technologies used in our services. We expect that we and our customers could be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of websites and third-party service providers for web-based businesses grows. Although we do not believe that our technologies or services infringe on the proprietary rights of any third parties, we cannot ensure that third parties will not assert claims against us in the future or that these claims will not be successful.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 3,600 employees. None of our employees are represented by unions. We consider the relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
Available Information
We make available free of charge on or through our investor relations website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities Exchange Commission ("SEC").
You may read and copy this Form 10-K at the SEC’s public reference room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the public reference room can be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding our filings at www.sec.gov.
