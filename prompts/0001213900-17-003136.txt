Item 1. Business.
 
Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms the “Company”, “Delta”, “we,” “our” and “us” refers to Delta International Oil & Gas Inc. and, as the context requires, its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Background
 
Delta was incorporated in Delaware on November 17, 1999. Our name was changed from Delta Mutual Inc. to our present name on October 29, 2013.
 
The primary focus of the Company’s business since 2008 has been its South American Hedge Fund, LLC (“SAHF”) subsidiary, which holds investments in oil and gas concessions in Argentina. Effective March 4, 2008, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in SAHF, and interests in four oil and gas investment operated by other firms were contributed to the Company as part of the acquisition. Under the terms of the operating agreements for these properties, SAHF has carried interests and was not required to make further investments in the development or operation of the properties. For accounting purposes, the transaction was treated as a recapitalization of the Company, as of March 4, 2008, with the parent of SAHF as the acquirer. SAHF maintains a branch office in Argentina, where it has conducted oil and gas exploration and development activities. Over the course of 2008 through 2013, six additional properties were acquired, all but one of which has been divested.
 
As a result of the review by our management team and our board of directors of oil and gas exploration and production operations in Argentina, and evaluation of a number of oil and gas properties over a period of several years, Delta did not find a suitable, economically viable oil and gas producing project in Argentina to acquire. The Company has shifted the focus of its efforts away from oil and gas investments and exploration in Argentina, plans to dispose of its Argentina properties, and has begun its entry into the technology sector. We have entered into an agreement as of January 3, 2017 to dispose of our investments in two oil and gas concessions (Tartagal and Morillo) in Argentina, as well as to transfer SAHF and the Valle de Lerma operating concession to third parties.

Our principal offices are located at 7272 E. Indian School Rd., Suite 540, Scottsdale, AZ 85251. Our telephone number is (480)483-0420. Our common stock is quoted on the Over-the-Counter Electronic Bulletin Board under the symbol “DLTZ”.
 
General
 
Our current operations are that of an independent oil and gas company engaged in oil and gas concession investments in Argentina discussed below.
 
We are in the process of transitioning to technology oriented business operations; we have made an initial investment in a company involved in the development of a technology for the transportation and desalination of water, using a specific propulsion technology that had been deemed uneconomic until present-day. Our investment was made in the first quarter of 2016.
 
Additionally, we are looking to make acquisitions of other technology-based companies with a long history of revenues and yielding positive operational cash flow. The first and second new acquisition candidates are under letters of intent as of the date of this filing.
 
Business Strategy
 
During 2014, we looked for other producing opportunities in Argentina, and expanded our search to the United States. During the first half of the year, Argentina’s economic and political situation deteriorated. During the second half of the year, the oil price had dropped by about 50% and the natural gas price was already low. As the oil prices began dropping, our management team then decided that it would be in the best interest of the shareholders to explore options in other industries.
 
During 2015, Delta discussed with several potential buyers the sale of its stake in its subsidiary, SAHF., as well as evaluated over 30 opportunities involving projects, company acquisitions, and reverse mergers to propel the company into its next stage. By the end of 2015, Argentina’s political landscape had changed dramatically to a more market-friendly government and its consequences will take years to unfold. Simultaneously, Delta had been in negotiations with a potential buyer to purchase the oil and gas properties held by SAHF.
 
During 2016, Delta negotiated with High Luck Group for the sale of SAHF’s stake in the Tartagal Oriental and Morillo concessions. Delta also invested in a water transportation technology company and helped it finish its simulations and prototype. Additionally, Delta evaluated potential reverse merger candidates and acquisition partners to solidify the future of the Company.
 
As of January 3, 2017, we have entered into a definitive agreement with High Luck Group Limited for the potential sale of our stake in our remaining investment properties in Argentina (the Tartagal Oriental and Morillo concessions). In the transaction, Delta would, following the sale of these properties, dispose of SAHF, which holds the Valle de Lerma concession, to a third party. Closing under the High Luck Group agreement is subject to various closing conditions, and no assurances can be provided that this transaction will be completed. As of March 31, 2017, the agreement to transfer SAHF to an undisclosed buyer was signed along with the release of 1/4th of the funds relating to the sale of Tartagal Oriental and Morillo.

On February 15, 2017, the Company signed a letter of intent for the acquisition of Naptech Test Equipment, Inc. This Letter of Intent also serves the purpose of bringing two corporate acquisitions experts along with several advisors into the Company so that it can adequately execute on its technology acquisition strategy. On March 22, 2017, the Company signed a letter of intent for the acquisition of Cardinal Electronics, Inc. to complement the Naptech acquisition. Both of these acquisitions are subject to due diligence by the parties and the execution of definitive agreements.
 
Our Oil and Gas Investments
 
SAHF has held interests in a total of ten oil and gas concessions in northern Argentina acquired in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2011. Currently, SAHF holds an interest in three concessions. The concession joint venture operators (of which SAHF is the operator of only the Valle de Lerma concession) have undergone all the required processes to obtain the necessary government and environmental operating permits for the commercial exploitation of the concessions. While we are not the operator of two of these concessions, we have representation on the operating committees that are responsible for managing the business affairs of the concessions.
 
At December 31, 2016 the SAHF participations in the Argentina concessions are as follows:
 

Block | Province | Status | Delta [SAHF] % | Partner(s) 
-------------------+----------+------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------
Tartagal | Salta | 2 Work over wells drilled; 2 exploratory wells to be drilled | 18% CO | New Times Energy (HK), Maxipetrol, JHP 
Morillo | Salta | 3D seismic interpretation; 2 exploratory wells to be drilled | 18% CO | New Times Energy (HK), Maxipetrol, JHP 
Valle de Lerma | Salta | Workover deemed undrillable | 30.6% | Remsa, PetroNexus, Grasta, New Times Energy (HK) 

 
*CO means a carryover interest in the project.
 ** In the Tartagal and Morillo concessions the carry over mode relieved SAHF from the payment of canons, landlord fees of any kind or any other expense until production is realized. In the exploratory area Valle de Lerma, proportional exploratory canons were paid as explained in the financials included in this report.

Tartagal and Morillo Concessions
 
Tartagal Oriental - The Tartagal Oriental (“Tartagal”) exploration license area, extended to March 2016, covers 7,065 square kilometers in Salta Province, located in the northern part of Argentina. Exploration dates back into the mid-20th century, and 22 wells, some oil producers, have been drilled in Tartagal Oriental since the 1960s. Of the 22 wells that have been drilled in Tartagal Oriental in the past decades, several were judged to be workover candidates by High Luck Group, the operator and majority owner. High Luck has invested approximately $60 million to date on: 1) geological studies, 2) 2D and 3D seismic surveys on both blocks, 3) two work-over drills, and 4)an exploratory well drill in Tartagal. Production from the two Campo Alcoba test wells commenced in 2011, continued into 2012, and then shut down due to large quantities of water in the oil. One more exploratory well is planned by the major partner.
 
Morillo - The Morillo exploration license area covers 3,518 square kilometers in Salta Province, contiguous with and south of the Tartagal Oriental license. Granted at the same time as Tartagal Oriental, the Morillo license was also extended to February 2016. In 2011, High Luck ordered a 274 square kilometer 3D seismic to be shot in the southwestern corner of the property because of a recent discovery made by Petrobras in an adjacent block. Once the data is processed, a decision will be made as to further drilling.
 
SAHF had 9% ownership of the Tartagal and Morillo oil and gas concessions located in Salta Province, Argentina, at December 31, 2010. Subsequent to year end, our ownership interest was increased to 18% in March 2011, and we sold 50% of that interest to PPL in 2012. Because of PPL’s default on payments, SAHF has retained its full 18% interest, to which it has clear title, in Tartagal and Morillo. In early 2016, SAHF and PPL cancelled all of their agreements with no further obligations to either side.
 
Terms of Carryover Arrangements- The Tartagal and Morillo interest was a carry-over interest from inception, May 15, 2007. The carrying party for Tartagal and Morillo concessions is currently High Luck Group Limited.
 
Under the terms of the carry over, 50% of the production profits will be applied to the investment payment. The balance of the production profits (50%) will be distributed proportionally according to the respective interests of the JV members. These terms only apply to the Tartagal and Morillo concessions. Once the exploration term is over, then the respective UTE members are subject to capital calls in the production term of the concession.
 
Current Status- As of March, 2016, the Tartagal and Morillo UTE was granted an exploration term extension of 18 months with around 6,000 work unit commitments, most of which are in the exploratory drilling category. The UTE has committed to drill four exploratory wells by September, 2017. It is expected to drill two of the committed wells by summer of 2017, and subsequently, the UTE will apply for another extension.
 
As of January 3, 2017, Delta signed an agreement with High Luck Group, the Tartagal Oriental and Morillo UTE operators, for the sale of 100% of SAHF’s interest in the Tartagal Oriental and Morillo concessions.

Valle de Lerma Concession
 
On August 10, 2011, SAHF and its partners, Remsa, PetroNexus, and Grasta SA, won the bid to explore and produce hydrocarbons in the block known as “Valle de Lerma” in the province of Salta, Argentina.
 
The Valle de Lerma block is located in the province of Salta in the northwestern region of Argentina and has an area of 5259 km2. SAHF has done the measurement and survey study and filed an environmental impact study, which was approved. Upon completion of the study, it was determined that the actual well site was within the boundaries of the City of Salta, where government restrictions do not allow oil to be produced. There is an additional commitment of 231 work units in Valle de Lerma outstanding.
 
SAHF is the responsible operator. The exploration terms are four years for the first period, three years for the second and two years for the last period.
 
SAHF currently owns 30.6% of the rights to explore Valle de Lerma; Grasta owns 5%; PetroNEXUS owns 30%; and Remsa owns 5%. 29.4% of the rights were sold to PPL under the PPL Agreement and High Luck Group was included in the UTE as 29.4% owners and 50% liable for all expenses as requested by PPL. However, the official government decree acknowledging High Luck Group as an owner has not yet been made.
 
Delta has spent about $500,000 and complied with about $800,000 of work unit commitments in relation to Valle de Lerma for which High Luck Group is liable for 50%. Additionally, the end of the first period for Valle de Lerma is in March 2016- which the UTE is not looking to extend.
 
Once the contract with High Luck Group is completed, SAHF will be transferred with Valle de Lerma to a third party that is interested in purchasing the company and concession. As of March 31, 2017, Delta signed a sale of SAHF agreement with Enrique Vidal representing an undisclosed buyer which is expected to close within 10 days of the issuance of the government decree accepting the transfer of the Tartagal Oriental and Morillo concessions.
 
Agreement with High Luck Group
 
On May 12, 2016, Delta and New Times Energy reached an agreement in principle for the sale of Delta’s 18% interest in the Tartagal Oriental and Morillo concessions.
 
The parties agreed to a total consideration of $US4,000,000 for the 18% interest in Tartagal Oriental and Morillo. The initial payment of US$2,000,000 will be placed in escrow at the signing and will be released when the official transfer of the interest in the properties is completed. Additionally, Delta would receive 3% of gross revenues of production of both oil and gas in the two concessions until an additional US$2 million is paid. New Times has committed to drill 4 exploratory wells in the next nine months in the Tartagal and Morillo concessions.
 
On January 3, 2017, a final agreement was signed between SAHF and High Luck. There is no assurance that the sale of the two concessions to High Luck Group, and the disposal of SAHF and the Valle de Lerma property to third parties, will be completed, given the closing conditions precedent and necessity of certain governmental actions in Argentina.
 
As of March 31, 2017, High Luck requested the release of $500,000 from the Escrow Agent in favor of Delta for the sale of Tartagal Oriental and Morillo. Most of the closing conditions have been completed, and the rest are currently being addressed. High Luck and SAHF formally applied for the decree allowing the transfer of Tartagal Oriental and Morillo on March 24, 2017. The decree is expected to be published in April, 2017.

Title to Properties
 
We believe we have satisfactory title in all of our properties; and we investigate title and title opinions from counsel only when we acquire properties or before commencement of drilling operations. All of our current properties have been acquired directly from the government. As all of our current property titles are issued by the Argentine government (Department of Energy), we believe that we are in full compliance with the title requirements for each of our properties.
Governmental Regulation
 
The Company’s operations in Argentina are subject to various laws, taxes and regulations governing the oil and gas industry. SAHF is registered in the Public Registry of Commerce, and the conduct and dealing of SAHF are governed by the commercial code and supplementary laws and regulations. Taxes generally include income taxes, value added taxes, export taxes, and other production taxes such as provincial production taxes and turnover taxes. Labor laws and provincial environmental regulations are also in place.
Exchange Controls
 
As a result of the devaluation of the Argentine peso at the beginning of 2002, several foreign exchange regulations were issued to limit the transfer of money abroad.
 
On October 13, 2011, the Argentine government launched a series of regulations to control the sale of foreign currency. The measures were aimed at slowing the rise in value of the North American dollar, of which the Argentine Central Bank has had to reduce its reserves in order to avoid the continuing devaluation of the Argentine peso against the dollar.
 
In January 2014, the government devalued the Argentine peso to the greatest extent since 2002, the year the government abandoned a one-to-one peg with the U.S. dollar following a record $95 billion default. Exchange control restrictions were eased following the January 2014 devaluation.
 
Since Mauricio Macri was sworn in as president on December 10, 2015, the country has been going through an aggressive reform agenda. On December 14, 2015, the government removed taxes on agricultural products such as wheat, beef and corn and reduced them on soybeans. On December 16, the new finance minister, Alfonso Prat-Gay, lifted currency controls on the Argentinean peso letting it float freely, as well as lifting the dollar purchasing restriction to $2,000,000 a month for corporations and individuals.  The reforms continued in January 2016 when Macri removed most utility subsidies and raised tariffs on wholesale energy prices, which had been stagnant for more than 10 years. Argentina also got a $5 billion loan to refill the central bank’s vault with international reserves and negotiated an agreement with U.S. hedge funds to settle the long-standing default legal conflict.
 
In the oil and energy sector, the President has focused on replacing key officials in the Energy Department across the country. He is also in the process of replacing part of the top management and board of directors at the national oil company – YPF. Currently, the oil and natural gas prices applicable domestically are artificially set at $63.00/bbl and up to $7.50/MCF, respectively, in order to keep exploration attractive and to meet domestic energy needs. The oil price is expected to be lowered by about $8.00/bbl by July, 2017.

On February 29, 2016, the government reached a settlement with four of its largest external creditors. Currently, the deal is being presented to Congress for final approval.
 
There are no restrictions for the payment abroad of interest, dividends or profits, royalties and other commercial payments duly supported by the corresponding documentation. There are presently no restrictions on foreign investment in the capital of local corporations.
 
Research and Development
 
We over the past several years we have not performed, and do not anticipate performing, any significant product research and development.


Investment in MHD Technology
 
The investment that Delta made into MHD Tech was primarily for research and development purposes. MHD Tech is a technology company that is focusing on the application of Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) forces on various industries. The current focus of the company is a product that applies an electric field and a perpendicular magnetic field to a pipeline in order to have salt water run through it. The objective would be to desalinate closer to the point of delivery, rather than the point of origin.
 
Delta observed that MHD Tech spent a large portion of its investment in overhead expenses. This, along with delays of the simulation, has caused MHD to need to raise additional capital to continue its research and development.
 
During 2016, MHD tech focused on developing a proof-of-concept prototype; running simulations; developing client and supplier relationships; and raising capital. After reprioritizing their original plans, MHD Tech completed its first project in October- developing a simulation video. This video, which is targeted towards potential customers, explains how the technology would theoretically work and discusses potential flow rates.
 
As of March 6, 2017, MHD Technology produced a demonstration video of its “proof-of-concept” prototype. This prototype demonstrated water being moved through a small pipeline using MHD propulsion, getting desalinated, and going into a different reservoir. The desalination was measured by a change in the pH balance of the water.
 
The working prototype is expected to serve various functions: gather more information regarding the technical specifications of the unit, raising additional capital for the first full-scale prototype development, forge partnerships to help develop the full-scale prototype, and increase interest in product licensing.


Employees
 
Currently, we have two management employees in Delta: Santiago L. Peralta, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, and Pablo D. Peralta, Director of Operations. In Delta’s subsidiary, SAHF, Alberto MacMullen is the manager of the SAHF’s Argentina branch. In the past, we have used temporary independent contractors while in oil drilling operations.
