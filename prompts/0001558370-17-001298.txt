     Overview
     RMG goes beyond traditional communications to help businesses increase productivity, efficiency, and engagement through intelligent digital signage messaging. By combining leading software, hardware, business applications, and services, we offer a single point of accountability for integrated data visualization and real-time performance management. We are headquartered in Addison, Texas, with additional offices in the United States, United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates.
     We provide enterprise communication solutions that empower organizations to visualize critical business data to better run their business in contact center, supply chain, internal communications, hospitality, retail and other applications primarily in the financial services, telecommunications, manufacturing, healthcare, pharmaceutical, utility and transportation industries, and for federal, state and local governments. We differentiate ourselves through dynamic business data visualization delivering real-time intelligent visual content that enhances the ways in which organizations communicate with employees and customers. The solutions we provide are designed to integrate seamlessly with a customer’s IT infrastructure and data and security environments. Our solutions are comprised of a suite of products that include proprietary software, software-embedded hardware, maintenance and support services, content and creative services, installation services and third-party displays.
     We power thousands of digital screens and end-points, and the diversity of products that we offer and our technical expertise provide our customers and partners with business data visualization solutions that differentiate us from our competitors. We are led by an experienced senior management team with a proven track record of building and successfully running and growing technology and services companies.
     Our operations span over 30 years with our principal subsidiary having been in operation since 1980.
     History
     We were incorporated in Delaware on January 5, 2011 as a “blank check company” for the purpose of effecting a business combination with one or more businesses. On April 8, 2013, we consummated the acquisition of RMG Networks Holdings, Inc., f/k/a Reach Media Group Holdings, Inc. (“Reach Media Group”), which became our Media business, pursuant to a merger agreement, dated as of January 11, 2013, as amended. On April 19, 2013, we consummated the acquisition of RMG Enterprise Holdings Corporation, f/k/a Symon Holdings Corporation (“Symon”), which became our Enterprise Solutions business, pursuant to a merger agreement, dated as of March 1, 2013. As a result of the Reach Media Group and Symon acquisitions, Reach Media Group and Symon became our subsidiaries, and the businesses and assets of Reach Media Group, Symon and their subsidiaries became our only operations. Symon was considered to be our predecessor for accounting purposes. On July 1, 2015, we sold the assets of our Airline Media Network to an unaffiliated third party, effectively exiting what were the legacy operations of our Media business.     Industry
     We believe digital signage in business environments allows companies to engage targeted audiences, such as employees and consumers, more effectively than traditional communications. The digital signage industry is comprised of software, hardware, content, and professional services that create solutions for business customers. Frost & Sullivan, in its 2015 Analysis of the Global Digital Signage Systems Market report, estimated that the market for digital signage system technology in 2014 was approximately $1.5 billion and expects the market to grow from 2014 to 2020 at a compound annual growth rate of 13.2%. Others, such as IHS, Inc. estimate that aggregate global digital signage expenditures, including ancillary components, approached $14 billion in 2014.
     As digital signage systems have evolved, they have become more cost effective and are able to provide richer media content. The initial costs of planning and deploying digital signage infrastructure have dropped, reducing a significant barrier to growth. Today’s solutions support remote manageability, energy efficiency and the ability to process and blend rich media content. We believe customers are increasingly recognizing the flexibility and cost-effectiveness digital signage can provide compared to other forms of communication.

     A key market driver that is dramatically impacting the traditional digital signage industry and driving increased utilization of digital signage solutions is a demand for real-time information. Because of increased technology enablement, both organizations and individual consumers expect information to be more available and timely. Digital signage solutions are increasingly providing organizations with multiple ways of distributing and collecting data in real time, often in an interactive manner.
     Competitive Strengths
     We believe that the following factors differentiate us from our competitors and position us for continued growth:
     We provide dynamic “real time” business data visualization. Differentiated from digital signage solutions that only offer the capability to place a set loop of content onto one or a few display endpoints, we offer solutions to dynamically visualize critical business data and content that help companies track and measure their operations or communicate with target audiences more efficiently and effectively. Our technology platform and integrated solutions can interface with a customers’ disparate business systems, assemble data, apply business logic and display the output in real-time on thousands of end points across a global network.
     Our products can be easily adapted to satisfy a wide array of customer applications. Our solutions encompass a full array of key consumer-facing, corporate and advertising network types. We believe our solutions add significant value and provide a definable return on investment across a diverse set of business applications such as real-time reporting and alerting for contact centers, supply chain warehousing and manufacturing. Other enterprise uses include company news and “real time” information for employee or corporate communications. Our products are also commonly used in public-facing environments, such as retail operations, hotels, convention centers, hospitals, universities, casinos and government facilities. Our enterprise software suite incorporates leading network security features and is both robust and scalable. Our solutions meet the requirements of many of the largest financial services and telecommunications companies in the United States. Our data-integration components ensure that nearly any external source can be leveraged in a solution, including databases, telephony, interactive kiosks, POS, RSS and web content, among others.
     We offer comprehensive, configurable solutions and not just individual solution components. One key to our market leadership is our robust software suite that offers flexibility for nearly any client application. This includes installations ranging from a single display to many hundreds or even thousands of end-points. This platform allows us to build, manage, maintain and monetize comprehensive visual communication solutions for our customers. To accomplish this, we approach the market with a full complement of integrated ready-to-use technologies, including our proprietary software and software-embedded appliances, and a wide range of proprietary and third-party flat screen displays, kiosks, video walls, mobile devices and other digital signage endpoints. We also provide a wide range of professional services including installation and training, software and hardware maintenance and support, and creative content. We are typically the prime source globally for technical resources for implementations that feature our proprietary software and software-embedded appliances. We maintain strong customer support groups in the United States and internationally offering around-the-clock client support. In addition, we have a full-time global team of content writers, video producers, graphic designers and editors who develop both original and subscription content as required by customers.
     We are trusted by some of the largest organizations in the world. Some of the largest and most demanding organizations, including a majority of Fortune 100 companies, count on our solutions every day to inform, educate and motivate their employees and customers and to build their brands. Because of our product’s ability to integrate with mission critical software applications, our solution is required to pass a higher level of security testing. We have found that add-on sales opportunities and customer longevity are very high when our hardware and software have been authorized by customers to work behind their firewalls. Being a trusted solution provider to large multi-national corporations also affords us the opportunity to efficiently cross sell throughout a customer’s global footprint and sell solutions for additional application areas into a single organization.
     We serve customers through a global footprint. We have offices or personnel focused on developing business located in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. We service thousands of customers worldwide and estimate that hundreds of thousands of people globally view our content each day on our customers’ installations. Our global presence enables us to satisfy the worldwide requirements of our multi-national customers and to pursue market opportunities in high-growth geographies outside of North America. To efficiently utilize our global footprint, we have well-established relationships with leading business partners and resellers around the world.

          Products and Solutions
     We provide enterprise communication solutions that empower organizations to visualize critical business data to better run their businesses. Our proprietary software platform seamlessly integrates with our customers’ existing mission critical departmental applications and offers premise-based or hosted content management, content subscription services and mobility solutions. We work closely with leading global technology partners, developing proprietary technical interfaces. Our solutions portfolio, comprised of solutions for Intelligent Contact Center, Visual Internal Communications, Visual Supply Chain and consumer-facing retail, financial services, higher education and hospitality applications, is assembled from the following product components:
     Enterprise Server (“ES”) is a robust software application server used to collect content from various application and other data sources, organize the content according to business rules and distribute the content to a variety of end-points, including our proprietary media players, PCs and mobile devices. Our data collectors, collectively called portal services, connect ES with customers’ enterprise applications to retrieve real-time data. Our data collectors give us a distinct advantage by being able to deliver solutions more quickly, less expensively and with higher quality than the competition.
     Media Players/Smart Digital Appliances (“SDA”) are media players with our software pre-loaded that function as the content storage and rendering hardware between our ES content engine and the visual display end-points (LED displays, HD TVs or PCs). SDAs “pull” content and content rules and parameters from ES and then render the content on the displays according to established rules and layouts.
     Design Studio (“DS”) is a software offering that is either a full-function application installed on the client’s PC (DS) used to design the look, feel, function and timing of how content is played on end-point displays. The software features a set of pre-designed templates that can be combined with external content feeds that are provided by us or other external content providers.
     InView™ software is a fully integrated internal communications software product delivering real-time business data and other content across all employee devices, including desktop, laptop, mobile and tablet. InView is a messaging platform that enables real time communication of rich media, including business data, to all or a subset of connected corporate

users. Automatic message delivery ensures employees are aware of critical events, for example call volumes spikes or emergency weather conditions, allowing them to quickly respond with appropriate actions to exceed established company goals.
     Subscription Content Services provides syndicated “business-appropriate” news and current information, created by our editors. In addition, weather, stock information, airport flight data and over 100 ticker feeds allow clients to customize the desired output in almost any manner they require. This service is hosted by us, and it complements customers’ messaging by keeping their audience engaged with fresh news and information throughout the day.
     Electronic Displays (“ED”) include a line of displays designed by us, such as door displays that are architected to work seamlessly with our content management software. We also offer a large portfolio of third-party displays from some of the most recognizable brands in screen and electronic display technology.
     MAX LED (“MAX”) includes a line of customizable LED display solutions for indoor and outdoor market applications. RMG’s MAX series offers full custom LED solution that scale to HD-quality image support, 4K and beyond, in addition to delivering embedded audio, energy efficiency, low heat emissions and an industry-leading 1.2mm pixel pitch. RMG MAX LED visual solutions integrate with RMG’s current software and creative content media players to further leverage the strength of existing platforms. 
     Global Sales Model
     We sell products and services through a worldwide professional sales force, as well as through a select group of resellers and local partners. In North America, approximately 92% of sales were generated solely by our sales team, with approximately 8% through resellers in the year ended December 31, 2016. Outside of the United States, the situation is reversed, with approximately 66% of sales coming from the reseller channel. Overall, approximately 75% of global sales were derived from direct sales, with the remaining 25% generated through indirect partner channels.
     Our global sales team includes approximately 41 sales representatives and sales support staff as of December 31, 2016. The sales representatives each have multiple years of specific experience in selling complex enterprise technology solutions. The sales team is supported in the pre-sales process by a team of highly skilled subject matter experts and sales engineers, who help to present solutions that meet each customer’s specific needs. In general, the sales compensation structure for the sales staff is approximately half base salary and half commissions. The amount of payment of commissions is dependent on representatives reaching their quarterly and annual sales objectives. In addition, commissions are modified by the overall profitability of the mix of products that are sold. Our resellers globally are generally supported by one or more of our sales team members to assist them with proposing unique solutions for clients and prospects.
     Customers
     Customers around the world purchase our enterprise communication solutions including software, hardware and services. For larger customers, a master services agreement is individually negotiated when necessary. Upon approval of the customer’s or reseller’s credit, customers purchase a solution which includes licensed software, hardware, installation services, training services, maintenance services and/or content services. Maintenance and content services are sold on an annualized basis, creating an annuity income stream and a close business relationship. Our resellers purchase products and services from us to resell to their clients. In general, we assist resellers with installation, training services and on-going support in partnership with our resellers.     Competition
     Holding a strong, competitive position in the market for intelligent visual solutions requires maintaining a diverse product portfolio that addresses a wide variety of customer needs. We believe we have been a leading global provider of such products and services for more than 30 years. Our customers include many of the largest organizations in the world and, as a result, our brand is well established globally. The worldwide digital signage market is vast and diverse. In addition to the scope of our product and service portfolio, we compete based upon commercial availability, price, visual performance, brand reputation and customer service. Customer requirements vary as to products and services, and as to the size and geographic location of the solutions.

 We compete with a broad range of companies, including local, national and international organizations. Some competitors offer a range of products and services; others offer only a single part of the overall digital signage solution. Though our direct competitors are numerous, diverse and vary greatly in size, we view our principal competitors as Cisco, Samsung, Broadsign, Four Winds Interactive, Inova, Janus Displays, John Ryan & Associates, Nanonation, Navori, S.A., Scala, Stratacache, Nanolumens and Visix.
     Our competitive strategy is built around our ability to provide end-to-end solutions; extensive software and hardware options; a consultative sales and partnership approach that delivers optimized customer solutions; a highly qualified staff of installation, integration and creative design professionals; seamless integration with customers’ IT infrastructure, data, and security environments; custom screen and content design; and post-sale customer service and global technical support. We believe that our relative size and competitive strategy gives us an advantage in the markets we serve.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2016, we had 161 global employees, with 113 in our North American operations and 48 employees in our international operations. Our U.S. employees are not covered by any collective bargaining units and we have never experienced a work stoppage in the U.S. Our international employees are also not covered by any national union contracts.     Intellectual Property and Trademarks
     We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, unfair competition and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and contractual restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology. We generally require employees, consultants, customers, suppliers and partners to execute confidentiality agreements with us that restrict the disclosure of our intellectual property. We also generally require our employees and consultants to execute invention assignment agreements with us that protect our intellectual property rights. Despite these precautions, third parties may obtain and use without our consent intellectual property that we own or license. Any unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.
     As of December 31, 2016, we had four issued patents expiring between 2019 and 2023 in the United States. None of these patents are material to our business. We cannot ensure that any future patent applications will be granted or that any of our issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property. In addition, third parties could claim invalidity or co-inventorship, or make similar claims with respect to any of our currently issued patents or any patents that may be issued to us in the future. Any such claims, whether or not successful, could be extremely costly to defend, divert management’s time, attention, and resources, damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business.
     We expect that we and others in the industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products and services overlaps. Our competitors could make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our products and underlying technology. Third parties may currently have, or may eventually be issued, patents upon which our current solution or future technology infringe. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
     Government Regulation
     We are subject to varied federal, state and local government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including tax laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees, public health and safety, zoning, and fire codes. We operate each of our offices, and distribution operations in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws, codes and regulations.
     We import and export products into and from the United States. These activities are subject to laws and regulations, including those issued and/or enforced by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure compliance with the applicable laws and regulations in these areas.
