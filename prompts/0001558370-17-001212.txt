     Activated Carbon and Service. The sale of activated carbon is the principal component of the Activated Carbon and Service business segment.  The Company is recognized as the leading manufacturer of bituminous coal-based granular activated carbon.  Activated carbon is a porous material that removes organic compounds from liquids and gases by a process known as “adsorption.”  In adsorption, undesirable organic molecules contained in a liquid or gas are attracted and bound to the surface of the pores of the activated carbon as the liquid or gas is passed through.
     The primary raw material used in the production of the Company’s activated carbons is bituminous coal, which is crushed, sized and then processed in rotary kilns followed by high temperature furnaces.  This heating process is known as “activation” and develops the pore structure of the carbon.  Through adjustments in the activation process, pores of the required size and number are developed for a particular purification application.  The Company’s technological expertise in adjusting the pore structure in the activation process has been one of a number of factors enabling the Company to develop many special types of activated carbon available in several particle sizes.  The Company also markets activated carbons from other raw materials, including coconut shell and wood.

     The Activated Carbon and Service business segment produces and sells a broad range of activated, impregnated or acid washed carbons in granular, powdered or pellet form.  Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) particles are irregular in shape and generally used in fixed filter beds for continuous flow purification processes.  Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) is carbon that has been pulverized into powder and is often used in batch purification processes, in municipal water treatment applications and for flue gas emissions control.  Pelletized activated carbons are extruded particles, cylindrical in shape, and are typically used for gas phase applications due to the low pressure drop, high mechanical strength, and low dust content of the product.
     Another important component of the Activated Carbon and Service business segment is the optional services that the Company makes available to purchasers of its products and systems.  It offers a variety of treatment services for customers including carbon supply, equipment leasing, installation and demobilization, transportation, and spent carbon reactivation.  Other services include feasibility testing, process design, performance monitoring, and major maintenance of Company-owned adsorption equipment.
     Spent carbon reactivation and re-supply is a key focus of the Company’s service business.  In the reactivation process, the spent GAC is subjected to high temperature remanufacturing conditions that destroy the adsorbed organics and ensure that the activated carbon is returned to usable quality.  The Company is permitted to handle and reactivate spent carbons containing hazardous and non-hazardous organic compounds.
     Granular carbon reactivation is conducted at numerous locations throughout the world.  It is valuable to a customer for both environmental and economic reasons, allowing them to reuse carbon cost-effectively without purchasing more expensive new carbon, and, at the same time, protecting natural resources.  The Company provides reactivation services in packages ranging from a fifty-five gallon drum to truckload quantities.
     The Company’s custom reactivation process for United States (U.S.) municipal drinking water treatment plants is specially tailored to meet the unique demands of the drinking water industry.  Activated carbon reactivation for use in drinking water treatment facilities in the U.S. must adhere to requirements of the American Water Works Association (AWWA) standard B605.  Perhaps the most important requirement of this standard is that the reactivator must return to the municipality/water provider its own activated carbon that has been reactivated.  Unlike industrial activated carbon reactivation practiced by a number of carbon companies, where carbons from different customers can be co-mingled and reactivated as a pooled material, drinking water carbons are carefully segregated.  This means that a drinking water provider’s activated carbon is kept separate not only from industrial customers’ carbons, but from the activated carbon of other providers’ activated carbon as well, to avoid any potential cross-contamination.  The Company maintains the integrity of each drinking water provider’s carbon, and its potable reactivation facilities and procedures strictly adhere to AWWA B605.  The Company’s Blue Lake, California, Columbus, Ohio, North Tonawanda, New York, and Gila Bend, Arizona plants have received certification from the National Sanitation Foundation International (NSF) under NSF/ANSI Standard 61: Drinking Water System Components - Health Effects for custom reactivated carbon for potable water applications.  NSF International is an independent, not-for-profit organization committed to protecting and improving public health and the environment.
     European custom reactivation process maintains the segregation of drinking water provider’s activated carbon and ensures returned product fulfills the requirements of European Standard EN12015 as well as specific additional requirements as found in the United Kingdom Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) approval list of products and in the KIWA-ATA certification.  Custom reactivation for European municipal drinking water treatment plants is performed in reactivation facilities in Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Italy.  The site in Feluy, Belgium, which is accredited ISO9001 and ISO14001 for Quality and Environmental management systems, is the only carbon reactivation facility in the world with ISO22000 accreditation for Food Safety Management System (FSMS).
     Transportation services are offered via bulk activated carbon deliveries and spent carbon returns through the Company’s private fleet of trailers, capable of transporting both hazardous and non-hazardous material.  The Company will arrange transportation for packaged and smaller volumes of activated carbon in appropriate containers and small returnable equipment through a network of commercial and less-than-truckload carriers.
     Sales for the Activated Carbon and Service segment were $454.6 million, $486.5 million, and $498.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

 Equipment. Along with providing activated carbon products, the Company has developed a portfolio of standardized, pre-engineered, activated carbon adsorption systems—for both liquid and vapor applications—which can be quickly delivered and easily installed at treatment sites.  Liquid phase equipment systems are used for potable water treatment, process purification, wastewater treatment, groundwater remediation, and de-chlorination.  Vapor phase equipment systems are used to control volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, off gases from air strippers, and landfill gas production.
     Through its UV Technologies LLC subsidiary, the Company also manufactures and sells a broad line of UV (ultraviolet) light disinfection equipment.  Following the Company’s introduction of an advanced UV oxidation process to remediate contaminated groundwater, in 1998, its scientists invented a UV disinfection process used to inactivate Cryptosporidium, Giardia and other similar pathogens in surface water, rendering them harmless to humans.  In combination with hydrogen peroxide, UV light is effective in destroying many contaminants common in groundwater remediation applications.  The Company participates in the marketplace for innovative UV technologies with its Sentinel® line designed to protect municipal drinking water supplies from pathogens, the C3 Series™ open-channel wastewater disinfection product line for municipal wastewater disinfection, and Rayox® UV advanced oxidation equipment for treatment of contaminants in groundwater, process water, and industrial wastewater. UV oxidation equipment can also be combined with activated carbon to provide effective solutions for taste and odor removal in municipal drinking water and for water reuse.
     Under the trade name Hyde Marine, which was acquired in 2010, the Company also manufactures and sells UV ballast water management systems (BWMS) that combine filtration and UV disinfection to treat and disinfect the ballast water taken in by a ship in one location, and discharged in another, to prevent the spread of non-indigenous aquatic organisms.  Invasion of non-native species via ballast water is considered to be one of the greatest threats to the world’s waterways and marine environment. The Company competes in this market with its Hyde GUARDIAN® BWMS – an easy-to-use, cost-effective, and chemical-free ballast water management solution.  The International Maritime Organization (IMO) type approved system meets the needs of ship owners committed to operating their vessels in a responsible, sustainable, and economic way through its proven reliability, flexible and compact design, and low operating costs.  In 2017, the Company is planning to complete the testing of its BWMS in order to apply to become type approved by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) for treating ballast water discharged in U.S. waterways.
     The Company also manufactures and sells fixed bed and continuous ion exchange equipment.  The proprietary continuous ISEP® (Ionic Separator) and CSEP® (Chromatographic Separator) units are used for the purification, separation and recovery of many products in the food and beverage, pharmaceutical, mining, chemical, and biotechnology industries.  The ISEP® and CSEP® systems are currently used in installations worldwide for a variety of applications in industrial settings, as well as in selected environmental applications including perchlorate and nitrate removal from drinking water.  The core technology of these systems is the proprietary rotary distribution valve.  This valve technology is offered in combination with a turntable for movement of media vessels, or with static media vessels where vessel-movement is simulated by recent advances in valve technology. 
     The Company assembles its equipment using parts that are both manufactured internally as well as purchased from other suppliers.  During periods of heightened demand, manufacturing and assembly may be outsourced to other qualified manufacturers.  
     Sales for the Equipment segment were $38.9 million, $39.3 million, and $45.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
     Consumer. The primary product offered in the Consumer segment is carbon cloth.  Carbon cloth, which is activated carbon in cloth form, is manufactured in the United Kingdom (UK) and sold to the medical, military, and specialty markets.  First developed in the 1970’s, activated carbon cloth was originally used in military clothing and masks to protect wearers against nuclear, biological and chemical agents.  Today, activated carbon cloth can be used in numerous additional applications, including sensor protection, filters for ostomy bags, wound dressings, conservation of artifacts, and respiratory masks.
     Sales for the Consumer segment were $8.7 million, $9.2 million, and $11.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Its capabilities include both food grade and industrial grade reactivation kilns.
     The remainder of the New Business is related to the manufacture of diatomaceous earth (DE) and perlite filtration media products.  These products, which are primarily used as filter aids in beverage, food, and industrial applications, are marketed and distributed across the European region in relatively close proximity to their manufacturing locations.
     For the production of DE products, the New Business is vertically integrated from the raw material source to the final product, as it owns two mineral deposit quarry sources which provide raw materials for its DE manufacturing processes.  DE is manufactured from diatomite, which is a lightweight and porous rock formed over many years by the successive accumulation and fossilization of the skeletal remains of single-cell algae – or diatoms – that lived in lakes, and were able to fix soluble silica on their shells.  These owned quarries each have 20 or more years of raw material reserves available.  The Company manufactures DE through a multi-step process that includes crushing, milling, calcination, and packaging.  The New Business’ DE products are sold throughout the European region under the broadly recognized Clarcel® brand name. 
     The New Business’ perlite products, widely known in Europe as Randalite® and Randafil™, are manufactured from perlite oar, which is a silica rock of volcanic origin that contains fine water droplets.  Through the New Business’ manufacturing process it is expanded at high temperature then crushed and grated into final product form.  The Company obtains its raw material for perlite manufacturing from mines located in the Mediterranean region.
