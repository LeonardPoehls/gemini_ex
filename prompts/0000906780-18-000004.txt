Item 1. | Business.

Overview
Empire Resorts, Inc. (“Empire,” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “us,” “our” or “we”) was organized as a Delaware corporation on March 19, 1993, and since that time has served as a holding company for various subsidiaries engaged in the hospitality and gaming industries. 
 Our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Montreign Operating Company, LLC, doing business as Resorts World Catskills ("Montreign Operating"), owns and operates Resorts World Catskills, a casino resort (the "Casino"), which is located in Sullivan County, New York approximately 90 miles from New York City. Montreign Operating is the sole holder of a gaming license (a "Gaming Facility License") issued by the New York State Gaming Commission ("NYSGC") in the Hudson Valley-Catskill region, which consists of Columbia, Delaware, Dutchess, Greene, Orange, Sullivan and Ulster counties in New York State. 
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Monticello Raceway Management, Inc. ("MRMI"), we own and operate Monticello Casino and Raceway, which began racing operations in 1958 in Monticello, New York, which is proximate to the Casino. Monticello Casino and Raceway currently features a video gaming machine ("VGM") and harness horseracing facility. We also generate racing revenues through pari-mutuel wagering on the running of live harness horse races, the import simulcasting of harness and thoroughbred horse races from racetracks across the country and internationally, and the export simulcasting of our races to offsite pari-mutuel wagering facilities.
 Gaming operations
Resorts World Catskills
Resorts World Catskills is located at the site of a four-season destination resort (“Destination Resort”) being developed on approximately 1,700 acres (the “EPT Property”) in the Town of Thompson, New York. The EPT Property is owned by EPT Concord II, LLC (“EPT”) and EPR Concord II, L.P. (“EPR LP”), two wholly-owned subsidiaries of EPR Properties, which is unrelated to the Company. The Casino is located in the Catskill region of New York State, which has historically been a resort area. The Destination Resort has a dedicated interchange off of New York State Route 17 at Exit 106 that delivers guests directly into the Destination Resort. Our casino operations are overseen by the NYSGC. Gaming at the Casino is permitted 24 hours a day and is limited to persons over the age of 21. Smoking is not permitted in the Casino.

Portions of the Casino opened to the public on February 5, 2018. When complete, the Casino is expected to include:

Resorts World Casino (1) | Number of Guest Rooms and Suites (2) | Approximate Casino Square Footage (3) | Slots | Gaming Tables
 | 332 | 100,000 | 2,151 | 154 

(1) This table reflects the amenities expected to be available once the Casino is fully opened.
(2) When complete, the number of guest rooms and suites will include eight 1,000-1,200-square foot garden suites, seven 2,400-square foot two-story townhouse villas, and 12 penthouse-level suites. The penthouse-level suites, and several rooms beneath the penthouse level, are expected to be completed in late 2018.
(3) The casino floor includes a 6,500-square foot poker room, a 3,800 square-foot VIP/high limit area located on the main gaming floor and a separate 4,000-square foot private gaming area containing private VIP gaming salons.
Monticello Casino and Raceway
Monticello Casino and Raceway is a VGM and year-round harness horseracing facility. Monticello Casino and Raceway is approximately three miles away from the Destination Resort, is directly adjacent to New York State Route 17 and has highly visible signage and convenient access from Exit 104 of New York State Route 17. 

VGM Operations
Monticello Casino and Raceway operates VGMs, which includes video lottery terminals (“VLTs”) and electronic table game positions (“ETGs”). VGMs are similar to slot machines, but they are connected to a central system and report financial information to the central system. ETGs include the games of roulette, blackjack and 3-card poker. Monticello Casino and Raceway currently features 1,070 VLTs and 40 ETGs (collectively 1,110 VGMs) on a 45,000-square foot gaming floor with a separate high stakes VGM area. Monticello Casino and Raceway also has three dining options which include a food court, restaurant and sports bar.

The VGMs at Monticello Casino and Raceway are owned by New York State and are overseen by the NYSGC. Revenues derived from our VGM operations consist of VGM revenues and food and beverage revenues. Gross VGM revenues consist of the total amount wagered at our VGMs, less prizes awarded. Video lottery gaming is permitted for no more than 20 consecutive hours per day and on no day can such operation be conducted past 6:00 a.m.
Raceway Operations, Simulcasting and Pari-mutuel Wagering Activities
Raceway operations, which include live harness horseracing, simulcasting and pari-mutuel wagering activities in New York State, are overseen by the NYSGC. In a letter dated December 15, 2017, the NYSGC approved MRMI’s racetrack and simulcast license renewal applications for calendar year 2018. Generally, the annual license renewal process requires the NYSGC to review the financial responsibility, experience, character and general fitness of MRMI and its management. 
We derive our racing, simulcasting and pari-mutuel wagering revenue principally from the following:

• | wagering at Monticello Casino and Raceway on live races run at Monticello Casino and Raceway and races broadcast from out-of-state racetracks using import simulcasting;


• | fees from wagering at out-of-state locations and internationally on races run at Monticello Casino and Raceway

using export simulcasting; and 

• | revenue allocations, as prescribed by law, from betting activity at off-track betting facilities in New York State.

Simulcasting is the process by which a live horse race held at one facility (the “host track”) is transmitted to another location that allows patrons of such other location to wager on that race. Amounts wagered at each off-track betting location are combined into the appropriate pools at the host track’s tote facility where the final odds and payouts are determined. With the exception of a few holidays, we offer year-round simulcast wagering from racetracks across the country. In addition, races of national interest, such as the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Breeders’ Cup supplement our regular simulcast programming. We also export live broadcasts of our own races to race tracks, casinos and off-track betting facilities in the United States and internationally.
In pari-mutuel wagering, patrons bet against each other rather than against the operator of the facility or with pre-set odds. The amounts wagered form a pool of funds from which winnings are paid based on odds determined by the wagering activity. 
2

The racetrack acts as a stakeholder for the wagering patrons and deducts from the amounts wagered a “take-out” or gross commission from which the racetrack pays state and county taxes and racing purses. Our pari-mutuel commission rates are fixed as a percentage of the total handle or amounts wagered.
Marketing
     Our marketing efforts are conducted through various channels. These channels include radio, television, print, outdoor and digital throughout the Hudson-Valley Catskill region and the larger New York City metropolitan area. Our more targeted marketing efforts are conducted through direct mail and email. We maintain websites to inform individuals about Resorts World Catskills and Monticello Casino and Raceway and utilize several social media sites to promote our brands, unique events, and special deals. Further, our direct marketing efforts utilize advanced analytic techniques that identify patron preferences to allow us to make more relevant offers to patrons, influence incremental visits, and help build lasting patron relationships. 
Resorts World Catskills
We expect Resorts World Casino will receive patronage from adults residing within the metropolitan New York City area, including New York City, northern and northwestern suburbs of New York City, northern New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania. The Casino has an overall drive-time advantage relative to other full-scale gaming facilities from the northern and northwestern suburbs of New York City and the Company will focus on servicing what we believe is an unmet demand in the New York metropolitan market. 
When complete, the Casino will have a range of high-end offerings, including 600 square-foot hotel suites, private gaming salons, poolside townhouse villas and garden suites and a VIP reception area and players’ lounge with private elevator, which are designed to appeal to higher-end gaming patrons in the market. The Casino is integrated into the master-planned Destination Resort, which will feature a range of year-round amenities. The Casino is also convenient to recreational offerings in the Catskill Mountains. 
We will leverage the Resorts World and Genting brands, which are well-known hospitality brands in the Asian markets, to target the large regional Asian gaming market and high-end Asian players. The Casino will offer various Asian-themed amenities, including table games and slot machines, an Asian gaming pit, high-end gaming and private gaming salons, and various authentic Asian food options.
We introduced a patron loyalty program to encourage patron relationships with Resorts World Catskills and increase loyalty to the Resorts World brand through unique benefits and rewards, while promoting our brand. When expanded, the patron loyalty program will include a rewards program that will allow patrons to qualify for benefits at participating Resorts World-branded resorts and in both gaming and non-gaming areas. Members may earn points for their gaming play which can be redeemed at participating properties. Information from the loyalty and rewards programs will be used to analyze patron usage and preferences by segment and individual player profile.
Monticello Casino and Raceway
Monticello Casino and Raceway receives patronage from adults residing within the surrounding counties of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The average drive-time of our current patrons is up to 60 minutes and therefore we focus on a convenience gaming market.
Monticello Casino and Raceway's mid-range offerings include gaming and dining options designed to appeal to locals and patrons interested in a more intimate and comfortable setting. Our Players' Club enables patrons to earn points that can be used for free slot play, complimentary food, merchandise, special offers, promotions, VIP invitations, discounts and coupons. The Players' Club also enables patrons to earn points when wagering on racing at Monticello Casino and Raceway.
Seasonality
The gaming market in the northeastern United States is seasonal in nature, with winter weather affecting patrons' ability to reach our facilities. However, because of the overnight accommodations at the Casino, we expect the adverse affects of winter weather to decline.

Competition
The casino entertainment industry is highly competitive. The industry is comprised of a diverse group of competitors that vary considerably in size and geographic diversity, quality of facilities and amenities available, marketing and growth strategies, and financial condition. Generally, we compete directly with casino and VGM facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding areas. Due to the geographic proximity, the Casino and Monticello Casino and Raceway may compete, in part, with each other for gaming patrons. The Casino will compete with other gaming and non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, various other entertainment businesses, and will also compete with other retail facilities, amusement attractions, food and beverage offerings, and entertainment venues.
In addition to competition from traditional gaming facilities, which is discussed in more detail below, the Casino and Monticello Casino and Raceway face competition from existing and prospective Internet gaming operations and sports wagering. In the United States, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 ("UIGEA") prohibits, among other things, the acceptance by a business of a wager by means of the Internet where such wager is prohibited by any applicable law where initiated, received or otherwise made. Under UIGEA, severe criminal and civil sanctions may be imposed on the owners and operators of such systems and on financial institutions that process wagering transactions in violation of UIGEA. The law contains a safe harbor provision for wagers placed within a single state (disregarding intermediate routing of the transmission) where the method of placing the bet and receiving the bet is authorized by that state's law, provided the underlying regulations establish appropriate age and location verification. For example, New Jersey law permits Atlantic City casinos to conduct Internet gaming by accepting wagers from individuals who are physically present in New Jersey. Additionally, mobile gaming is permitted in any area located within the property boundaries of a casino hotel facility, including any recreation or swimming pool and excluding parking garages and parking areas. Further, New Jersey law permits racetrack patrons to place bets on live or simulcast racing while they are on racetrack property, including the restaurants and outdoor areas, such as the paddock. New Jersey gaming regulations also authorized skill-based gaming options that appeal to a new generation of players. In October 2017, Pennsylvania signed into law new legislation also authorizes interactive gaming in the form of Internet gaming and up to five video gaming terminals at qualified truck stops. The legislation additionally authorizes fantasy sports wagering if and when it is permitted under federal law. 
A number of other states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation to specifically authorize Internet poker and Internet gambling. In February 2018, the governors of New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware announced an agreement to allow Internet poker operators to pool players with partner sites in those states. New York legislators have introduced bills related to Internet gaming and Internet poker. Additionally, two state lotteries offer (and other state lotteries are considering offering) Internet instant game sales to in-state lottery customers and a number of other states, including New York, allow subscription sales of lottery draw games over the Internet. We are unable to determine whether and which, if any, legislation will be enacted and what effect it would have on our current operations. 
In addition, the outcome of a U.S. Supreme Court case argued in December 2017, Governor Christopher J. Christie, et al., v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, et al., may affect state and federal policies with respect to sports wagering. This case is expected to address the question of whether the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, a federal statute enacted to stop the spread of state-sponsored sports gambling, impermissibly commandeers the regulatory power of the states. In anticipation of that outcome, certain states, including New York, have adopted or are considering adopting legislation to legalize sports betting, subject to federal restrictions on sports wagering being lifted. On August 3, 2016, New York Governor Cuomo signed legislation to legalize interactive fantasy sports. The Casino is able to offer sports wagering if and when it is permitted under federal law. 
Other states, such as Pennsylvania, recently passed a broad gaming expansion bill, which, among other things, authorized Internet gambling in the form of slot machines, table games and poker. This new legislation also authorized Pennsylvania's lottery to distribute lottery products, including instant ticket games, through numerous channels including web applications, mobile applications, mobile web, tablets and social media. In addition, this new Pennsylvania bill authorized land-based and Internet sports wagering in the event the federal restrictions on sports wagering are lifted. We expect Internet gaming and sport wagering to continue to be the topic of additional legislation, including the expansion of legalization efforts within New York State to venues other than holders of Gaming Facility Licenses. We are unable to determine whether and which, if any, legislation will be enacted and what effect it will have on our operations and our prospects.

Resorts World Catskills

We face competition in and from the northeastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut gaming markets in marketing to and attracting patrons from the New York City metropolitan area. Pennsylvania casinos are the competitors located closest to our Casino. Pennsylvania casinos operate table games and slot machines, grant casino credit and have access to unlimited non-taxable free play. The competing Pennsylvania facilities include the following: Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, located approximately 95 miles southwest of Monticello; Mount Airy Casino Resort in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, approximately 70 miles southwest of Monticello; and Sands Casino Resort in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, located approximately 95 miles southwest of Monticello. In addition, in October 2017, Pennsylvania signed into law new legislation that authorized a number of gaming expansion opportunities. The legislation authorized up to 10 new casino satellite facilities, which would operate between 300 to 750 slot machines and up to 50 table games each. Licenses for these new facilities are awarded through an auction process that began in January 2018. This legislation also authorizes interactive gaming in the form of Internet gaming and up to five video gaming terminals at qualified truck stops. The legislation additionally authorizes fantasy sports wagering if and when it is permitted under federal law. New York State has regulatory limitations on the amount of taxable free play that may be offered to patrons. This could impact our competitiveness as compared to casinos in neighboring jurisdictions. 
In addition to facing potential competition from the casinos in Atlantic City, legislators in New Jersey have reviewed options to expand gaming to various locations in northern New Jersey which could increase competition. Although New Jersey voters previously defeated a referendum to amend the New Jersey State Constitution to permit two casinos in northern New Jersey, another referendum could be introduced in the future. We are unable to predict the impact additional gaming opportunities in northern New Jersey will have on our operations. 
We face competition from Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Resort Casino, both of which are located on tribal reservations in Connecticut, and from certain VGM facilities in New York State, including VGM facilities located at Yonkers Raceway and Aqueduct Racetrack, both of which are within the New York City metropolitan area.
Further, we also face potential competition from the current or future expansion of state-licensed and tribal gaming in the northeastern United States. Commercial casino gaming has expanded in the northeastern United States and is poised to expand further. These expansions, many of which are convenience gaming facilities as opposed to destination gaming facilities, may affect our revenues.
Monticello Casino and Raceway
In New York State, we face competition for our VGM guests from Orange, Dutchess and Ulster counties in New York and from a VGM facility at Yonkers Raceway. To a lesser extent, Monticello Casino and Raceway faces competition from the Pennsylvania casinos, Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs and Mount Airy Casino Resort. These facilities are discussed above.
Generally, Monticello Casino and Raceway does not compete directly with other harness racing tracks in New York State for live racing patrons. However, Monticello Casino and Raceway does face intense competition for off-track and other legalized wagering at numerous gaming sites within New York State and the surrounding region. The inability to compete with larger purses for the races at Monticello Casino and Raceway and the limitation on other forms of legalized wagering that Monticello Casino and Raceway may offer has been a significant limitation on our ability to compete for off-track and other legalized wagering revenues.
Development
The Golf Course Project and the Entertainment Project
In addition to the Casino, Empire Resorts Real Estate I, LLC ("ERREI") and Empire Resorts Real Estate II, LLC ("ERREII" and, together with Montreign Operating and ERREI, the "Project Parties"), each of which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Montreign Operating, are developing an entertainment village (the "Entertainment Project") and a golf course (the "Golf Course Project" and, together with the Casino and the Entertainment Project, the "Development Projects"), respectively, at the site of the Destination Resort. 
On May 24, 2017, the Company received final site plan approval from the Town of Thompson Planning Board ("Planning Board") for the Entertainment Project, which will consist of a non-gaming hotel with 100-200 guest rooms, as well as dining, entertainment and retail offerings. Further, the Planning Board approved a minor amendment to the Entertainment Project's final site plan on February 14, 2018. The Company expects construction of the Entertainment Project to begin in March 2018. Montreign Operating entered into a construction manager agreement with Arc Building Partners, LLC., which is a standard construction 
5

manager agreement, with normal and customary terms, and addresses, among other things, the guaranteed maximum price of approximately $32.7 million for the Entertainment Project, completion commitments and MWBE participation in the Entertainment Project. 
The Company has obtained final site approval from the Planning Board for, and has begun site preparation of, the redesign of the Golf Course Project. The Planning Board extended this site plan approval until June 2018 to allow the Company to coordinate the commencement of construction and to obtain final approval of updates to the wetlands permits from the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, if required.
In addition to the Development Projects, the Destination Resort will include a waterpark lodge, which subsidiaries of EPR Properties are responsible for developing (the “Waterpark” and, together with the Development Projects, the “Initial Projects”). 
Master Development Agreement and Completion Guaranties
On December 28, 2015 (the “MDA Effective Date”), the Project Parties, on the one hand, and EPT, EPR LP and Adelaar Developer, LLC (the “Destination Resort Developer,” together with EPT and EPR LP collectively, “EPR”), on the other hand, entered into an Amended and Restated Master Development Agreement (as amended, the “MDA”), which amends and restates that certain master development agreement by and between EPT and MRMI originally executed on December 14, 2012. The MDA defines and governs the overall relationship between EPR and the Project Parties with respect to the development, construction, operation, management and disposition of the Initial Projects.
In accordance with the terms of the MDA, EPR is responsible for the development and construction of the Waterpark and the common infrastructure-related improvements (such as streets, sidewalks, sanitary and storm sewer lines, water, gas, electric, telephone and other utility lines, systems, conduits and other similar facilities) for the Destination Resort. EPR has agreed to make a minimum capital investment of $120 million with respect to the Waterpark and the infrastructure for the Destination Resort. On December 28, 2015, EPR Properties, a real estate investment trust and the parent company of EPR, entered into a Completion Guaranty, guaranteeing completion of the development and construction obligations of EPR described in this paragraph.
Neither party has the right to terminate the MDA unless Montreign Operating fails to exercise the Purchase Option (as defined below) prior to its expiration in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Purchase Option Agreement (as defined below).
On January 24, 2017, the MDA was amended to (a) reflect that EPR has secured bond financing in connection with its infrastructure development obligations and (b) account for increases in the common infrastructure budget (and corresponding increases in Empire’s common infrastructure cap amount) in connection with the development of additional roads and increase in the budgeted amounts for New York State electric and gas costs. EPR financed the costs of the infrastructure by the issuance of tax-exempt bonds by a local development corporation. The debt service for these infrastructure bonds will be funded through special district tax assessments, a portion of which will be allocated to each of the parcels on which the Initial Projects are being built. EPR and the Project Parties have agreed to a capped dollar amount on the special district tax assessment for each of the parcels on which the Development Projects are being built, above which the Project Parties will not be responsible. The changes to Empire’s common infrastructure cap amount were also reflected in each of the amendments to the Casino Lease, Golf Course Lease and Entertainment Project Lease.
On January 24, 2017, Empire agreed to issue a completion guaranty of up to $30 million for the Casino, under the terms of a term loan agreement negotiated for the construction of the Casino. 
Intellectual Property
RWS License Agreement
On March 31, 2017, Montreign Operating entered into a license agreement (the “RWS License Agreement”) with RW Services Pte Ltd (“RWS”). RWS is an affiliate of Tan Sri Lim Kok Thay, who is a beneficiary of and controls Kien Huat Realty III Limited ("Kien Huat"), Empire's largest stockholder. Pursuant to the RWS License Agreement, RWS granted Montreign Operating the non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable and limited right to use certain “Genting” and “Resorts World” trademarks (the “RWS Licensed Marks”) in connection with the development, marketing, sales, management and operation (the “Permitted Uses”) of the Development Projects. The right to use the RWS Licensed Marks may be assigned or sublicensed only in certain limited circumstances. However, any use of the RWS Licensed Marks for a purpose other than the Permitted Uses will require the prior written consent of RWS. The name of the Casino is “Resorts World Catskills,” and, notwithstanding the foregoing, the use 
6

of such name is exclusive to Montreign Operating and may be used in connection with on-line gaming in addition to the Permitted Uses.
The initial term of the RWS License Agreement will expire on December 31, 2027, and will be extended automatically for additional terms of 12 months each, up to a maximum of 39 additional terms, unless either of the parties provides notice to terminate the RWS License Agreement or upon the mutual written consent of both parties. Montreign Operating’s rights and obligations under the RWS License Agreement are subject to and governed by the rules and regulations applicable to Montreign Operating’s gaming operations at the Casino, and the fiduciary obligations of the boards of directors of Montreign Operating and Empire, as well as the fiduciary obligations of Kien Huat. Beginning on the date on which the Casino opened to the public, Montreign Operating pays to RWS a fee equivalent to a percentage of Net Revenue (as such term is defined in the RWS License Agreement) generated in each calendar year from (i) all activity at the Casino, (ii) each specific use of the RWS Licensed Marks in the Entertainment Project or Golf Course and (iii) each specific use of the name Resorts World Catskills in connection with on-line gaming. The percentage of Net Revenue payable as the fee is a low single digit percentage that will increase incrementally between the third year and sixth year of the term of the RWS License Agreement and will remain a low single digit percentage during the entire term of the RWS License Agreement.
During the term of the RWS License Agreement, Montreign Operating may participate in the Genting Rewards Alliance loyalty program (the “Alliance”), which would provide central marketing and cross-promotion opportunities for the Development Projects with other members of the Alliance. Montreign Operating’s participation in the Alliance is subject to the provisions of a separate agreement, which is currently being negotiated by the parties.
Trademarks
Our principal intellectual property consists of trademarks for Montreign Operating and Monticello Casino and Raceway and includes the license agreement to use the RWS Licensed Marks. These trademarks are brand names under which we market our properties, venues and services. We consider these brand names to be important to our business since they have the effect of developing brand identification. We believe that the name recognition, reputation and image that we develop will attract patrons to our facilities.It is our intent to pursue and maintain the trademark registrations consistent with our goals for brand development and identification, and enforcement of our rights.
Employees and Labor Relations
As of March 15, 2018, we had approximately 1,600 full-time and 150 part-time employees, which includes employees hired in connection with the Casino. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 428 full-time and 37 part-time employees. We had collective bargaining agreements with unions covering approximately 94 of our employees as of December 31, 2017. The collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 75 employees at Monticello Casino and Raceway is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2018. We will begin negotiations with a bargaining unit for a collective bargaining agreement for certain employee groups at Resorts World Catskills. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Regulation and Licensing
The gaming industry is highly regulated and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. The Casino and Monticello Casino and Raceway are subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules, and regulations of New York State. These laws, rules, and regulations generally concern the conduct of operations as well as the responsibility, financial stability, and character of the facilities, owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Individuals and entities, including investors and vendors conducting business with us, must file license/registration applications with the NYSGC, and in some instances must submit to background investigations by the New York State Police in order to prove suitability for licensure/registration. Application, fingerprinting and investigative fees must be paid by us or by the individual or entity seeking licensure or registration. Failure to obtain and maintain a license or registration, as applicable, could require us to sever our relationship with such individuals and/or entities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations or the Development Projects. 
Our businesses are also subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations, in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, construction, land use, and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and federal anti-money laundering ("AML") laws, as further discussed below. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, 
7

or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operations or the Development Projects. 
Gaming Act and Gaming Facility License
The operations of the Casino are subject to regulation by the NYSGC, Division of Gaming. The Upstate New York Gaming and Economic Development Act ("Gaming Act") provides, among other things, the statutory framework for the regulation of full-scale casino gaming. The Gaming Act authorized the NYSGC to award up to four Gaming Facility Licenses. Effective March 1, 2016, the NYSGC awarded Montreign Operating the sole Gaming Facility License in the Hudson Valley-Catskills region. The Gaming Facility License has an initial duration of 10 years from March 1, 2016 and will be renewable thereafter for a period of at least an additional 10 years, as determined by the NYSGC. The NYSGC also awarded one Gaming Facility License in the Albany region and two Gaming Facility Licenses in the eastern Southern Tier/Finger Lakes region. The Gaming Act provides that no casinos shall be authorized in Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens or Richmond counties. New York State may, however, legislatively authorize additional Gaming Facility Licenses.
The Gaming Act provides for a seven-year exclusivity period for holders of Gaming Facility Licenses, commencing March 1, 2016, during which no further Gaming Facilities can be licensed by the NYSGC without legislative action. If the New York State legislature authorizes additional Gaming Facility Licenses within this exclusivity period, holders of the original four Gaming Facility Licenses shall have the right to recover a pro rata portion of the license fee paid. 
The Gaming Act imposes a $500 annual fee on each slot machine and table game. The tax rate on slot machines at the Casino is 39% and the tax rate on table games is 10%. Although free play allowances are not established by the Gaming Act, the NYSGC has promulgated a regulation that limits non-taxable free play to 15%, although the NYSGC may, at its discretion, authorize deviations from these limitations. 
Moreover, the Gaming Act deems the Casino to be a New York State agency for its capital projects for the purpose of participation by minority-owned and woman-owned business enterprises ("MWBEs") and the NYSGC regulations require all contracts with Montreign Operating that are in excess of $25,000 to be reviewed by the NYSGC for the purpose of MWBE participation. 
Regulatory Permits and Approvals Relating to the Development Projects
The Casino

The Casino received all approvals and permits required to begin construction in February 2015 and began construction soon thereafter. In June 2015, Montreign Operating submitted certain changes in the design of the Casino, which received approval in July 2015. As of February 5, 2018, Montreign Operating had received its Operation Certificate in order to begin gaming operations at the Casino, which is subject to NYSGC's authority to revoke, suspend, limit or otherwise alter such Operation Certificate and shall remain in full force and effect as long as Montreign Operating remains licensed.
Entertainment Project and Golf Course Project
On December 8, 2016, the Company submitted to the Planning Board an application for site plan approval for the hotel to be located within the Entertainment Project. On May 24, 2017, the Planning Board adopted a resolution granting final site plan approval with conditions for the hotel. The Planning Board approved a minor amendment to the final site plan on February 14, 2018. The Company expects construction of the Entertainment Project to begin in March 2018.
The Company has obtained final site approval from the Planning Board for, and has begun site preparation of, the redesign of the Golf Course Project. The Planning Board extended this site plan approval until June 2018 to allow the Company to coordinate the commencement of construction and to obtain final approval of updates to the wetlands permits from the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, if required.
    
VGM and Racing Operations
Our VGM, harness horseracing and simulcast activities in New York State are overseen by the NYSGC, Division of Lottery and Division of Horse Racing and Pari-Mutuel Wagering, respectively. The NYSGC has the authority and responsibility to promulgate rules and regulations that affect the operations of our business. In a letter dated December 15, 2017, the NYSGC approved MRMI’s racetrack and simulcast license renewal applications for calendar year 2018. Generally, the annual license 
8

renewal process requires the NYSGC to review the financial responsibility, experience, character and general fitness of MRMI and its management.
We generate revenue from our VGM operations by receiving a commission on the gross revenue generated by the VGMs. The rate of this commission is set by statute. From April 1, 2008 until March 31, 2018, the statute provides that 41% of gross VGM revenue be distributed to us as a commission. Effective as of April 1, 2018, the statute would reduce the commission rate to 39% of gross VGM revenue. However, with the arrival of casinos into the regions in which VGM facilities are currently operating in New York State, the Gaming Act provides that the commission payable to VGM facilities will be increased over the statutory amount and equalized to the blended tax rate payable by holders of Gaming Facilities Licenses with respect to gross gaming revenue generated on table games and slot machines. Accordingly, we expect the commission we receive on our VGM operations for the period following the opening of the Casino will equal the blended tax rate on the Casino's gross gaming revenue. There is also a marketing allowance for racetracks operating video lottery programs of 10% on the first $100 million of net revenues generated and 8% thereafter. In addition, the statute provides for subsidized free play allowance of 15%.
The Gaming Act includes provisions intended to minimize the impact on horsemen of declining revenue at VGM facilities as a result of the introduction of casinos into the region. If VGM facilities are unable to maintain required purse support payments to horsemen at licensed racetracks in amounts equal to at least the 2013 payment amounts, as adjusted for the consumer price index, the holder of a Gaming Facility License in the region in which the licensed racetrack is located is required to make whole the deficit. Accordingly, if the purse support payments from Monticello Casino and Raceway to the horsemen are below the dollar levels realized in 2013, then the Casino must make whole the deficit.
Anti-Money Laundering Laws
        The operations of the Casino and Monticello Casino and Raceway are subject to federal AML laws. The AML laws relate to the reporting of large cash transactions and suspicious activity and include screening transactions against lists maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control in order to prevent the processing of transactions to or from certain countries, individuals, nationals and entities. Our AML policy was developed by applying a risk-based approach and is tailored to our business activities and patron risk profiles. The risk assessment will be updated and revised to reflect changes in our business to ensure sufficiency and effectiveness of our AML policy. Failure to comply with the AML laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties.
