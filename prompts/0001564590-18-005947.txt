Item 1. Business 
Summary 
 We are a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing differentiated anti-infectives for the hospital and select non-hospital, or community, settings that address the need for effective treatments for infections due to resistant gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. We currently market four antibiotics to treat a variety of infections caused by these resistant bacteria.
 Melinta was formed as a private company in October 2000, and operated using funds from licensing and collaboration agreements, private equity placements and debt until 2017. We received approval for our first drug, Baxdela™ (delafloxacin), in June 2017. We began sales of Baxdela in January 2018. On November 3, 2017, we completed a reverse merger with Cempra, Inc., as a result of which the registrant Cempra, Inc. was re-named Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. and we became a publicly-traded company. See “Corporate History and information” below for further information.
 We operate and manage our business as one operating segment and all of our operations are in North America. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
 Acquisition of the Infectious Disease Businesses of The Medicines Company
 On January 5, 2018, we acquired the Infectious Disease Businesses (“IDB”) from The Medicines Company (“Medicines”), including the capital stock of certain subsidiaries of Medicines and certain assets related to its infectious disease business (the “IDB Transaction”), including the pharmaceutical products containing (i) meropenem and vaborbactam as the active pharmaceutical ingredient and distributed under the brand name Vabomere™  (“Vabomere”), (ii) oritavancin as the active pharmaceutical ingredient and distributed under the brand name Orbactiv® (“Orbactiv”) and (iii) minocycline as the active pharmaceutical ingredient and distributed under the brand name Minocin® for Injection (“Minocin”) and line extensions of such products (the “Products” and together with Baxdela, the “Product Portfolio”). In addition to the Products acquired in the IDB Transaction, we added approximately 135 individuals from Medicines to our team. The new team members bring with them significant experience specific to infectious diseases and better position Melinta to effectively execute our commercial and other activities.
Market Opportunity
 The relentless evolution of bacterial antibiotic resistance, coupled with the dearth of effective new antibiotics, has created an urgent public health threat. The integration of the acquired Products within our existing portfolio further strengthens our ability to serve the needs of providers treating patients with serious bacterial infections across the healthcare delivery continuum. Our combined Product Portfolio, pipeline, resources and people has created a standalone entity with the ability to help address the significant need for new antibiotics to treat serious infections across multiple healthcare channels, while exercising a firm commitment to antibiotic stewardship.
 The combined Product Portfolio supports our multi-channel strategy of delivering antibiotics for serious gram-positive and gram-negative infections due to resistant bacteria within the hospital, emergency department, and community settings. We believe that each product has distinct value in the antibiotic marketplace, and that we are uniquely positioned to deliver this value:

Combined Antibiotic Portfolio
 Melinta has a deep pipeline of commercial, clinical and preclinical antibiotic assets across multiple approved and potential indications, and has a platform for long-term, durable growth and a strategy to expand the anti-infective portfolio over time, providing the opportunity for multiple layers of revenue growth.

Our marketed products are expected to deliver a distinct value proposition across the antibiotic care continuum:
 

Baxdela (delafloxacin)
 Baxdela is a commercial-stage asset that offers a new option for monotherapy treatment of adult patients with acute bacterial skin or skin structure infections (“ABSSSI”) in oral and intravenous (“IV”) formulations. Baxdela is a novel fluoroquinolone that exhibits activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, is unique among quinolones in that it is effective against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureaus (“MRSA”), and is available to initiate therapy on either the IV or oral formulation. In clinical trials, Baxdela demonstrated a differentiated safety and tolerability profile as compared to vancomycin plus aztreonam. On June 19, 2017, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved the use of Baxdela as a treatment of adult patients with ABSSSI. The commercial launch of Baxdela for the adult patient treatment of ABSSSI occurred in the first quarter of 2018.
 The FDA also confirmed Baxdela’s status as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (“QIDP”) under the provisions of the 2012 Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now Act (the “GAIN Act”), and extended by five years the five-year exclusivity granted to Baxdela as a new chemical entity (“NCE”), for a total of ten years in the United States. Consequently, and because we believe Baxdela has utility across many different infection types, we have commenced Phase 3 clinical development for community acquired bacterial pneumonia (“CABP”) and may pursue additional indications for Baxdela in the future. Baxdela has the potential to address a variety of bacterial infections in the United States. In addition, we have partnered with leading multinational pharmaceutical firms for distribution of Baxdela in markets outside the United States, including with Menarini IFR SrL for Europe and Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan) and with Eurofarma Laboratórios S.A. for Central and South America. We may obtain additional funds through the achievement of regulatory, commercial and sales-based milestones, as well as royalties on sales of Baxdela outside the United States.
 We believe that the pricing strategy for Baxdela is supportive of ensuring appropriate clinical use. We have initially priced Baxdela at a Wholesale Average Cost of $265 per treatment day for the IV formulation and $135 per treatment day for the oral formulation. Based on research with hospital administrators, clinicians and payors, we believe we can support both appropriate stewardship and a compelling economic value.
 Vabomere (meropenem and vaborbactam)
 Vabomere is the combination of meropenem, the leading carbapenem used in treatment of gram-negative infections, and vaborbactam, a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits certain types of resistance mechanisms used by bacteria. Vabomere received FDA approval on August 29, 2017, for the treatment of patients 18 years of age and older with complicated urinary tract infections (“cUTI”), including pyelonephritis, caused by designated susceptible Enterobacteriaceae and became commercially available in the fourth quarter of 2017. Vabomere was specifically developed to address gram-negative bacteria that produce beta-
 4


lactamase enzymes, particularly the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (“KPC”) enzyme. KPC-producing bacteria are responsible for a large majority of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the United States and are classified by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) to be an urgent antimicrobial resistance threat. With its approval, the FDA also confirmed that Vabomere is eligible for the five-year GAIN Act extension of exclusivity under the provisions of the GAIN Act, though the question of whether Vabomere would be eligible for a five-year NCE exclusivity or three-year exclusivity was referred to the Exclusivity Board of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”). The new drug application (“NDA”) for Vabomere was based upon the TANGO-1 study, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of Vabomere versus piperacillin/tazobactam in cUTI and acute pyelonephritis due to susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. In the TANGO-1 study, 98.4% of patients on the Vabomere arm met the primary endpoint of clinical success at the end of IV treatment, compared to 94% of patients in the piperacillin/tazobactam arm. Patients in the Vabomere arm of the study had fewer discontinuations due to AEs as compared to the piperacillin/tazobactam arm (2.9% vs. 5.1%), and the type of AEs seen in the trial were similar to that of meropenem alone.
 On July 25, 2017, Medicines announced positive results from a planned interim analysis of the TANGO-2 trial, a multi-center, randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial. The TANGO-2 trial compared Vabomere to best available therapy (“BAT”) in the treatment of infections caused by CRE and is the only trial that evaluated a monotherapy option in CRE. Randomization in the trial was stopped early, following a recommendation by the Drug Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”). The recommendation was based upon an interim analysis of 72 patients, including 43 with microbiologically evaluable CRE infections of blood, lung urinary tract and abdominal organs. The DSMB concluded that the benefit-risk ratio no longer supported randomization of patients to the BAT arm due to results seen in patients in the Vabomere arm. The data showed a higher cure rate at test of cure and end of therapy as well as lower all-cause mortality versus BAT across all infection types. In addition, Vabomere had a lower rate of drug-related AEs versus BAT (24% vs. 44%).
 Vabomere is indicated for cUTI and we believe the profile represents a leading therapy for treatment of serious infections due to gram-negative bacteria, including KPC-mediated CRE, which is Vabomere’s focus:
 Approved for cUTI
 Key Focus for Vabomere –KPC-mediated CRE
 
We have continued the launch of Vabomere with a sales force that primarily interacts with infectious disease and critical care physicians, microbiologists and hospital pharmacists, including infectious disease clinical pharmacists. We are leveraging our presence in the hospital setting to promote Vabomere, as well as our other products. Additionally, we have a team of medical science liaisons across the United States to meet with and educate infectious disease and critical care key opinion leaders.
 We believe Melinta is capable of distinguishing Vabomere’s economic value proposition through a pricing strategy that is in line with currently branded therapies used in the treatment of such serious gram-negative infections and designed to facilitate access within the hospital. Market research with hospital pharmacy directors has confirmed that Vabomere’s launch price of $990/day will allow access within the hospital while also capturing the incremental value the product has over currently available therapies. In addition, we believe the economic value proposition of Vabomere is expected to be demonstrated through health economic outcomes analyses and a budget impact model that show a lower cost per patient compared to best available therapies.
 Orbactiv
 Orbactiv is a long-acting IV antibiotic of the lipoglycopeptide class that allows for single infusion for the treatment of adult patients with ABSSSIs caused or suspected to be caused by susceptible gram-positive bacteria, with no dose adjustment for mild/moderate renal or hepatic impairment or for age, weight, gender, or race. It provides an alternative solution to hospital admission or multiple days of therapy in outpatient setting. In contrast to the current standard of care (6 to 10 days of IV therapy), single-dose 
 5


ABSSSI therapy with Orbactiv alternative increases patient convenience, helps to ensure patient adherence with a single dose, and allows for treatment in alternative, lower cost care settings. We are leveraging our community-based sales force infrastructure to maximize Orbactiv’s potential.
 Minocin for injection
 Minocin is an IV antibiotic of the tetracycline class with broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. A new formulation was launched in 2015, which improved tolerability and convenience in administration, owing to a smaller required infusion volume. Minocin is one of the few agents approved for treatment of Acinetobacter spp. Acinetobacter infections are generally seen in the intensive care unit (“ICU”), particularly in mechanically ventilated and immunocompromised patients. We are leveraging our hospital-based sales force infrastructure to maximize Minocin’s potential.
 Solithromycin
 Solithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that was acquired by Melinta in the merger with Cempra. Prior to the time of the merger, Cempra advanced solithromycin through Phase 3 studies for an indication in adults with CABP. After Cempra received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA in December 2016, Cempra worked with the FDA to determine a path forward, which included a pre-approval safety study that would include 7,200 subjects and a post-approval commitment to study an additional 3,600 subjects. Management estimated that the combined cost of the pre- and post-approval studies would be approximately $140.0 million. Given the significant cost of the trial, management determined that the trial would only be pursued if non-dilutive funding were available to fund the cost of the trial. After working unsuccessfully to identify non-dilutive funding, management has made the election to not pursue this study. We are also conducting a pediatric CABP trial, which is being funded by with the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”). A pediatric indication would only be pursued if an adult indication was likely. Melinta held a discussion with BARDA on March 15, 2018, and the parties jointly agreed to wind down this pediatric study.  
 Solithromycin is also being studied by Toyama, our partner in Japan. Toyama has made significant progress to date across multiple clinical trials. We will continue to support Toyama’s efforts to commercialize solithromycin in Japan.
 Fusidic Acid
 Fusidic Acid was also a pipeline program acquired in the merger transaction with Cempra. Cempra completed one successful Phase 3 program for fusidic acid for ABSSSI. A second Phase 3 trial would be required to obtain approval for fusidic acid. We have no current plans to initiate the additional Phase 3 study that would be required.
 Prior to the merger, Cempra had also initiated a Phase 2 program, studying fusidic acid as chronic suppressive treatment in refractory staphylococcal bone and joint infections.  In a single arm study of 30 patients, clinical success was seen in 60% of patients after six months of treatment. Investigators may elect to keep patients on treatment for up to two years. Fusidic acid has been well tolerated, but resistance developed in some patients with this long-term use.  Resistance development over long-term use is a known risk with extended use antibiotics. Given this finding, we do not intend to pursue further clinical development for fusidic acid in bone and joint infections.  
 Key Business Strategies
 We are focused on development and commercialization of new antibiotics that enable patients with serious, life-threatening bacterial infections to be successfully treated. We plan to carefully evaluate our capital allocation strategy to maximize shareholder value around the recent launches of Baxdela and Vabomere, and the marketing of Orbactiv and Minocin, while maintaining a capital efficient approach to investing in our development programs and other opportunities. The critical components of our business strategy are:

1. | Commercialize Baxdela for ABSSSI in the United States. In the first quarter of 2018, we launched Baxdela in the United States with an efficient, targeted sales force consisting of approximately 50 sales territories, prioritizing high-value hospital accounts. In addition, sales representatives target other market channels, such as the emergency department and select community settings in an attempt to realize the full market potential of Baxdela.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Commercialize Vabomere for cUTI in the United States. We market Vabomere in the United States with an efficient, targeted sales force consisting of approximately 85 sales territories, prioritizing high-value hospital accounts, focusing on infectious disease and critical care physicians.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Optimize commercialization of Orbactiv and Minocin within the United States. We are leveraging our sales force presence within the hospital to appropriately position Minocin for the treatment of serious infections due to Acinetobacter. In addition, sales representatives target emergency department and community market channels to realize the full market potential of Orbactiv in the treatment of ABSSSI.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Pursue additional indications and regional approvals, leveraging our robust product portfolio and 10-year market exclusivity periods, as applicable, in the United States. We may pursue additional indications for 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6


 
existing products, leveraging the existing exclusivity period and are pursuing regional approvals both directly and in cooperation with commercialization partners outside the United States.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Leverage Melinta’s discovery platform and proprietary understanding of the ribosome to deliver novel drugs that can address the continuous need to combat bacterial resistance. Our discovery platform has the potential to drive significant long-term value by providing a continual stream of novel antibiotics that meet the constantly evolving challenge of bacterial resistance. Our discovery platform is capable of both producing improvements to existing classes of drugs, as well as, developing new antibiotics. We and our partner have advanced radezolid, an improved oxazolidonone class antibiotic discovered by Melinta, into Phase 2 for the treatment of acne. We have also received QIDP designation for radezolid for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis and are currently in the preclinical stage for this indication. We are advancing its research efforts in the antibacterial space led by our ESKAPE pathogen program targeting “superbugs,” and are evaluating the potential of other platform opportunities in antifungals, antiparasitics and oncology. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Optimize partnerships to maximize the value of the product portfolio. We have a number of partnerships, including established partnerships for Baxdela in Europe and Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan) with Menarini IFR Srl, and in Central and South America with Eurofarma Laboratórios S.A. We have also secured a development partnership with a contract research organization (“CRO”) for our pipeline asset, radezolid, which is focused on the topical dermatology space, and we have a relationship related to solithromycin with Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd. (“Toyama”) in Japan. Opportunities exist to leverage existing or new partnerships for the combined Product Portfolio. We plan to evaluate the potential of existing and new business development opportunities to further generate non-dilutive capital and enhance shareholder value.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These partnerships are already progressing towards producing revenue. Menarini IFR Srl announced on March 8, 2017, that they had submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency for delafloxacin (to be marketed under the trade name Quofenix in Europe) for the treatment of adult patients with ABSSSI.  In South America, Eurofarma has submitted an application for approval to market Baxdela in Argentina and is preparing applications to several other countries.
  
7. | Follow a rigorous process that will determine which programs and at what pace additional programs will be advanced. With the combination of Melinta, the assets of Cempra and the assets of the IDB business, we have a rich portfolio of candidates for development. We intend to follow a disciplined and financially prudent process to determine the optimal timing to advance additional products or indications. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8. | Leverage the enterprise’s commercial organization to promote complementary internally or externally developed products upon achievement of FDA regulatory approval. With an experienced team and commercial infrastructure in place, we are well positioned to add either internally or externally developed products to our portfolio while adding minimal new costs. We may selectively pursue the addition of externally developed products to our existing marketed products and pipeline, leveraging our commercial infrastructure. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition 
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
 In many cases, however, we believe that competition often will be determined by antibiotic class and any limitations of that antibiotic class in general, and the antibiotic specifically, in treating a particular disease or population.  We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of product candidates that we develop or acquire are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, convenience in dosing, price and reimbursement.
 Intellectual Property 
 Due to the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products to market, biopharmaceutical companies have traditionally placed considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for significant new technologies, products and processes. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by Patent Term Adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent. In the United States, and certain other countries, the patent’s term may also be lengthened by patent term extension or restoration, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays in granting a regulatory approval by the FDA, or similar agency in other countries. 
 7


While we pursue patent protection and enforcement of all our products and product candidates, and aspects of our technologies when appropriate, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain our competitive position. To protect this competitive position, we regularly enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with third parties, including employees, independent contractors, suppliers and collaborators. Our employment policy requires each new employee to enter into an agreement containing provisions generally prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of our company and providing that any invention conceived by an employee within the scope of his or her employment duties is our exclusive property. We have a similar policy with respect to independent contractors, generally requiring independent contractors to enter into agreements containing provisions generally prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of our company and providing that any invention conceived by an independent contractor within the scope of his or her services is our exclusive property with the exception of contracts with universities and colleges that may be unable to make such assignments. Furthermore, our know-how that is accessed by third parties through collaborations and research and development contracts and through our relationships with scientific consultants is generally protected through confidentiality agreements with the appropriate parties. 
 Baxdela
 We have a license, both exclusive and nonexclusive, from Wakunaga Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd. to certain patents and patent applications, and to certain patents and patent applications of AbbVie. We have also licensed technology from CyDex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (now a wholly owned subsidiary of Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated) for the use of Captisol, a sulfobutylether beta-cyclodextrin excipient, in connection with Baxdela. We have developed and patented additional technology independently.  The patent portfolio for Baxdela and delafloxacin meglumine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Baxdela, is related to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, manufacturing methods and methods of use. In addition to the licensed and owned issued U.S. patents, the portfolio includes pending U.S. patent applications and corresponding foreign national or regional counterpart patents or applications. We expect that the patents and the patent applications in the portfolio, if issued, will expire between 2025 and 2034.
 Minocin for injection
 As a result of our acquisition of IDB, we acquired a patent portfolio relating to certain minocycline formulations and certain methods of administering minocycline. We have patents relating to the Minocin IV composition and certain methods of administering minocycline, each of which is set to expire in May 2031. We are also prosecuting other patent applications relating to minocycline formulations and methods of treatment in the United States and in certain foreign countries.
 Orbactiv
 As a result of our acquisition of IDB, we obtained an exclusive license from Eli Lilly to patents relating to Orbactiv, its uses, formulations and methods of manufacture. The earliest-filed patent for Orbactiv that we acquired in our acquisition of Targanta, which relates to the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Orbactiv, will expire in the United States in November 2020. The Medicines Company also developed and patented additional technology.  We acquired from Medicines U.S. patents relating to methods of treatment expiring in 2029 and 2030, as well as a patent co-owned with AbbVie relating to high purity oritavancin that expires in 2035. Numerous foreign counterparts have been filed, including in Europe and Eurasia, for these more recent methods of treatment and compositions. We are also prosecuting a number of patent applications relating to Orbactiv and its uses in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions.
Vabomere
 As a result of our acquisition of IDB, we acquired a portfolio of patents and patent applications relating to Vabomere, including the vaborbactam compound, the Vabomere composition, and methods of use. We are currently prosecuting related patent applications relating to Vabomere’s pharmaceutical composition and its use in the United States and in certain foreign countries.  In addition, patent applications are pending for synthesis intermediates, manufacturing flow processes and additional methods of use, which, if issued, would expire between 2035 and 2038.
Collaborations and Commercial Agreements
 See Notes 8 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on certain of our collaboration and commercial agreements.
 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of the products in our product portfolio, or for the other product candidates that we might develop, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, API and finished products for commercial sales, as well as for our pre-clinical research and clinical trials. We employ internal resources and third-party consultants to manage our manufacturing contractors. 
 8


To date, we have ordered pre-clinical and clinical supplies under short-term contract orders. We do not have long-term contracts for the commercial supply of any of the products we sell, except for certain contracts for the production of ingredients of Vabomere. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are marketing or developing. All of our approved products are subject to extensive regulation, and our antibiotic product candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. 
U.S. Drug Development and Review Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | Completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices or other applicable regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s current good clinical practices (“cGCP”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”) to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product.  The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices.  The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol.  Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans.  If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.  Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator.  Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.  Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients.  The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (“IRB”) for approval.  An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.

Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap.  In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness.  Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks.  If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug.  In most cases FDA requires two adequate and well‑controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug.  A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious or life-threatening disease in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access.  
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA.  FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S.  The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls.  The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial.  The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, which is typically increased annually.  
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review.  Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review.  The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of new drug applications.  Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months.  Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists.  The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee – typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts – for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved.  The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.  Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.  Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured.  FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 After FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter.  A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application.  If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter.  FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.  As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks.  REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”).  ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries.  The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug.  Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy.  Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biological products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on the website www.clintrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of a clinical trial are then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of clinical trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of clinical development programs as well as clinical trial design.
Pediatric Information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective.  The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data.  Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.  
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”) provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity – patent or non-patent – for a drug if certain conditions are met.  Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe.  Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications.
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, a portion of a product’s U.S. patent term that was lost during clinical development and regulatory review by the FDA may be restored. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide a process for listing patents pertaining to approved products in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the “Orange Book”) and for a competitor seeking approval of an application that references a product with listed patents to make certifications pertaining to such patents. In addition, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments provide for a statutory protection, known as non-patent exclusivity, against the FDA’s acceptance or approval of certain competitor applications.
Patent Term Restoration
 Patent term restoration can compensate for time lost during product development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. Patent term restorations, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims covering the applicant’s product or method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents identified in the application for the drug are then published in the FDA’s Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a Section VIII statement certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 11


A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been filed by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 An applicant submitting an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, is required to certify to the FDA regarding any patents listed in the Orange Book for the approved product it references to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
 Market Exclusivity
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE. A drug is entitled to NCE exclusivity if it contains a drug substance no active moiety of which has been previously approved by the FDA. This means that, in the case of a fixed-dose combination product, the FDA makes the NCE exclusivity determination for each drug substance in the drug product and not for the drug product as a whole. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification. For a drug that has been previously approved by the FDA, the FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the new conditions of use and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs for the original conditions of use, such as the originally approved indication. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Antibiotic Exclusivity 
 Under the GAIN Act, upon NDA approval, a drug product designated by FDA as a QIDP receives a five-year extension of any five-year NCE exclusivity, three-year exclusivity, or seven-year orphan drug exclusivity.  This exclusivity applies only with respect to drugs that are first approved on or after July 9, 2012.  An efficacy supplement to an approved NDA is not eligible for the five-year exclusivity extension if the application that is being supplemented has previously received the five-year GAIN exclusivity extension.  A QIDP is defined as an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by (1) an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens or (2) qualifying pathogens, which are defined as those that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health and that are included in a list established and maintained by FDA.
 A drug sponsor may request that FDA designate its product as a QIDP at any time prior to NDA submission.  FDA must make a QIDP determination within 60 days of receiving the designation request.  The first NDA for a specific drug product and indication for which QIDP designation was granted will automatically be granted priority review.  A subsequent application from the same sponsor for the same product and indication will receive priority review designation only if it otherwise meets the criteria for priority review.
 12


Post-Approval Requirements in the United States
 Any drug product for which we receive FDA approval will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, cGMP requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and consistent with the provisions of the approved labeling. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, beginning in 2018, the applicant under an approved NDA is subject to a substantial annual program fee (replacing the previous product and establishment fees) for each prescription drug product.
 Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”), a part of the FDCA. In addition, Title II of the Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act or the DSCSA, has imposed new “track and trace” requirements on the distribution of prescription drug products by manufacturers, distributors, and other entities in the drug supply chain. These requirements are being phased in over a ten-year period. The DSCSA ultimately will require product identifiers (i.e., serialization) on prescription drug products in order to establish an electronic interoperable prescription product system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States. The DSCSA replaced the prior drug “pedigree” requirements under the PDMA, and preempts existing state drug pedigree laws and regulations. The DSCSA also establishes new requirements for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third-party logistic providers. These licensing requirements preempt states from imposing licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or otherwise encompassed by standards established by FDA pursuant to the DSCSA. Until FDA promulgates regulations to address the DSCSA’s new national licensing standard, current state licensing requirements typically remain in effect.
 The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems (quality or safety) occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown quality, safety, or other problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties. 
 In addition, from time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. For example, in September 2007, the FDAAA was enacted giving the FDA enhanced post-market authority, including the authority to require post-market studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information and compliance with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. Failure to comply with any requirements under the new law may result in significant penalties. The law also authorized significant civil money penalties for the dissemination of false or misleading direct-to-consumer advertisements and allows the FDA to require companies to submit direct-to-consumer television drug advertisements for FDA review prior to public dissemination. In addition to this legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws and Other Regulatory Matters
 In the United States, in addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years.  These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, and other statutes pertaining to health care fraud and abuse.  The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs.  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, “ACA”), amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it.  This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other.  Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.  Although 
 13


there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.
 Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid.  This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule.  Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product.  In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws.  Additionally, the ACA amended the federal false claims law such that a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal false claims law.  The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror/payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the healthcare fraud statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services.
 Pursuant to the ACA, manufacturers of prescription drugs are required to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reports are due on an annual basis, and the reported data is posted in searchable form on a public website.  Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.  
 There are also an increasing number of state laws with requirements for manufacturers and/or marketers of pharmaceutical products.  Some states require the reporting of expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and the reporting of gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states.  Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals.  Still other states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to, and justification of, price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging.  In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes.  Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, as discussed below, a similar federal requirement requires manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state, and soon federal, authorities.
 Government Programs for Marketed Drugs
 Medicaid, the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and Medicare
 Federal law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer, as a condition of having its products receive federal reimbursement under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, must pay rebates to state Medicaid programs for all units of its covered outpatient drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program under either a fee-for-service arrangement or through a managed care organization. This federal requirement is effectuated through a Medicaid drug rebate agreement between the manufacturer and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) administers the Medicaid drug rebate agreements, which provide, among other things, that the drug manufacturer will pay rebates to each state Medicaid agency on a quarterly basis and report certain price information on a monthly and quarterly basis. The rebates are based on prices reported to CMS by manufacturers for their covered outpatient drugs. For innovator products, that is, drugs that are marketed under approved NDAs, the basic rebate amount is the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price (“AMP”) for the quarter or the difference between such AMP and the best price for that same quarter. The AMP is the weighted average of prices paid to the manufacturer (1) directly by retail community pharmacies and (2) by wholesalers for drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies. The best price is essentially the lowest price available to non-governmental entities. Innovator products are also subject to an additional rebate that is based on the amount, if any, by which the product’s current AMP has increased over the baseline AMP, which is the AMP for the first full quarter after launch, adjusted for inflation. For non-innovator products, generally generic drugs marketed under approved abbreviated new drug applications, the basic rebate amount is 13% of the AMP for the quarter. Until recent amendments to the statute, this was the only rebate applicable to non-innovator products. However, as a result of a November 2015 
 14


amendment, non-innovator products are also subject to the additional rebate. The additional rebate is similar to that discussed above for innovator products, except that the baseline AMP quarter is the fifth full quarter after launch (for non-innovator multiple source drugs launched on April 1, 2013 or later) or the third quarter of 2014 (for those launched before April 1, 2013). The statutory definition of AMP was amended in 2010 by the ACA. In February 2016, CMS published a final rule to further define AMP and provide clarification on other parts of the rebate program.  The terms of participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in additional or lesser rebate liability, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates, if a manufacturer were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information.
 A manufacturer must also participate in a federal program known as the 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available to pay for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Under this program, the participating manufacturer agrees to charge certain safety net healthcare providers no more than an established discounted price for its covered outpatient drugs. The formula for determining the discounted price is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and the unit rebate amount as calculated under the Medicaid drug rebate program, discussed above. Manufacturers have not been required to report any pricing information to the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”), but HRSA issued a notice proposing to collect such information from manufacturers on a quarterly basis and is in the process of preparing a system to operationalize this requirement. HRSA has also issued regulations relating to the calculation of the ceiling price as well as imposition of civil monetary penalties for each instance of knowingly and intentionally overcharging a 340B covered entity.
 Federal law also requires that manufacturers report data on a quarterly basis to CMS regarding the pricing of drugs that are separately reimbursable under Medicare Part B. These are generally drugs, such as injectable products, that are administered “incident to” a physician service and are not generally self-administered. The pricing information submitted by manufacturers is the basis for reimbursement to physicians and suppliers for drugs covered under Medicare Part B. As with the Medicaid drug rebate program, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information.
 Medicare Part D provides prescription drug benefits for seniors and people with disabilities. Medicare Part D beneficiaries have a gap in their coverage (between the initial coverage limit and the point at which catastrophic coverage begins) where Medicare does not cover their prescription drug costs, known as the coverage gap. However, by 2020, Medicare Part D beneficiaries will pay 25% of drug costs after they reach the initial coverage limit - the same percentage they were responsible for before they reached that limit - thereby closing the coverage gap. The cost of closing the coverage gap is being borne by innovator companies and the government through subsidies. Beginning in 2011, each manufacturer of drugs approved under NDAs was required to enter into a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount agreement and provide a 50% discount on those drugs dispensed to Medicare beneficiaries in the coverage gap, in order for its drugs to be reimbursed by Medicare Part D.  The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the manufacturer’s subsidy under the program from 50% to 70% of the negotiated price, beginning in 2019.  
 Federal Contracting/Pricing Requirements
 Manufacturers are also required to make their covered drugs, which are generally drugs approved under NDAs, available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”), of the General Services Administration. The law also requires manufacturers to offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing for purchases of their covered drugs by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense (“DoD”), the Coast Guard, and the Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service) in order for federal funding to be available for reimbursement or purchase of the manufacturer’s drugs under certain federal programs. FSS pricing to those four federal agencies for covered drugs must be no more than the Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”), which is at least 24% below the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (“Non-FAMP”) for the prior year. The Non-FAMP is the average price for covered drugs sold to wholesalers or other middlemen, net of any price reductions.
 The accuracy of a manufacturer’s reported Non-FAMPs, FCPs, or FSS contract prices may be audited by the government. Among the remedies available to the government for inaccuracies is recoupment of any overcharges to the four specified federal agencies based on those inaccuracies. If a manufacturer were found to have knowingly reported false prices, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the law provides for civil monetary penalties of $100,000 per incorrect item. Finally, manufacturers are required to disclose in FSS contract proposals all commercial pricing that is equal to or less than the proposed FSS pricing, and subsequent to award of an FSS contract, manufacturers are required to monitor certain commercial price reductions and extend commensurate price reductions to the government, under the terms of the FSS contract Price Reductions Clause. Among the remedies available to the government for any failure to properly disclose commercial pricing and/or to extend FSS contract price reductions is recoupment of any FSS overcharges that may result from such omissions.

Tricare Retail Pharmacy Network Program
 The DoD provides pharmacy benefits to current and retired military service members and their families through the Tricare healthcare program. When a Tricare beneficiary obtains a prescription drug through a retail pharmacy, the DoD reimburses the pharmacy at the retail price for the drug rather than procuring it from the manufacturer at the discounted FCP discussed above. In order for the DoD to realize discounted prices for covered drugs (generally drugs approved under NDAs), federal law requires manufacturers to pay refunds on utilization of their covered drugs sold to Tricare beneficiaries through retail pharmacies in DoD’s Tricare network. These refunds are generally the difference between the Non-FAMP and the FCP and are due on a quarterly basis. Absent an agreement from the manufacturer to provide such refunds, DoD will designate the manufacturer’s products as Tier 3 (non-formulary) and require that beneficiaries obtain prior authorization in order for the products to be dispensed at a Tricare retail network pharmacy. However, refunds are due whether or not the manufacturer has entered into such an agreement.
Branded Pharmaceutical Fee
 A branded pharmaceutical fee is imposed on manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs (including authorized generics), generally drugs approved under NDAs (excluding orphan drugs). In each year between 2011 and 2018, the aggregate fee for all such manufacturers will range from $2.5 billion to $4.1 billion, and then will remain at $2.8 billion in 2019 and subsequent years. This annual fee is apportioned among the participating companies based on each company’s sales of qualifying products to or utilization by certain U.S. government programs during the preceding calendar year. The fee became effective January 1, 2011, and is not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Utilization of generic drugs, generally drugs approved under ANDAs, is not included in a manufacturer’s sales used to calculate its portion of the fee.Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Our primary strategy is to find partners that operate in foreign countries and collaborate with them to seek approval for, and market, our products, generating royalty and licensing revenue.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend considerably on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our products may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 In 2003, the U.S. government enacted legislation providing a prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. In March 2010, the ACA, as amended, became law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. We anticipate that this legislation will result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product. Federal, state and local governments in the United States continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of health care costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing. 
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of 
 16


these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of our particular drug products to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Corporate History and Information 
 On November 3, 2017, Cempra, Inc. merged with privately-held Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. in a reverse triangular merger, wherein the former Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. became a subsidiary of Cempra, Inc. and was re-named Melinta Subsidiary Corp. As a result of the merger, the holders of preferred and common shares of the former Melinta Therapeutics, Inc., as well as, holders of convertible notes issued by the former Melinta Therapeutics, Inc., became holders of shares of common stock of Cempra, Inc. Immediately after the merger, Cempra, Inc. was renamed Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. Our stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol MLNT.
 Cempra, Inc. was originally formed as Cempra Holdings, LLC, a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware, on May 16, 2008. Cempra Holdings, LLC was formed in connection with a reorganization whereby the shareholders of Cempra Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 18, 2005, exchanged their shares of Cempra Pharmaceuticals, Inc. stock for shares of Cempra Holdings, LLC, pursuant to a merger of a subsidiary of Cempra Holdings, LLC with and into Cempra Pharmaceuticals, Inc., as a result of which Cempra Pharmaceuticals, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cempra Holdings, LLC. 
 On February 2, 2012, Cempra Holdings, LLC converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation and was renamed Cempra, Inc. As a result of the corporate conversion, the holders of common shares of Cempra Holdings, LLC became holders of shares of common stock of Cempra, Inc. and the holders of preferred shares of Cempra Holdings, LLC became holders of shares of common stock of Cempra, Inc.
