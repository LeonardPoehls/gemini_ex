Unless otherwise provided in this report, all references in this report to “we,” “us,” “MagneGas,” “our Company,” “our,” or the “Company” refer to MagneGas Corporation and our subsidiaries.
 
Overview
 
MagneGas Corporation is a technology company that utilizes a plasma based system for the gasification and sterilization of liquid waste. A byproduct of our process is a hydrogen-based fuel called “MagneGas2®” that we sell for metal cutting as an alternative to acetylene. We also market, for sale or licensure, our proprietary plasma arc technology for the processing of liquid waste (the “Plasma Arc Flow® System”). We have established a retail and distribution platform to sell our fuel for use in the metalworking industries. We have also developed a global network of brokers to sell our system for processing liquid waste. In addition, we are conducting research and development regarding the use of our fuel for co-combustion with hydrocarbon fuels to reduce emissions. Finally, we have and intend to continue to acquire complementary gas distribution businesses in order to become a larger distributor of MagneGas2®, other industrial gases and related equipment.
 
In October of 2014, we purchased Equipment Sales and Services, Inc. (“ESSI”) for $3 million cash. ESSI is a full line seller of industrial gases and equipment for the welding and metal cutting industries. Since acquiring ESSI, we have opened three additional retail locations and distribute our proprietary MagneGas2® product as well as other gases and welding supplies through ESSI, our wholly owned subsidiary.
 
In 2017, the Company began de-emphasizing its research and development activities so it could focus on increasing sales, growing ESSI and acquiring other new welding supply businesses, primarily in Texas and California.
 
On February 1, 2017, the Company formed two wholly owned subsidiaries in the State of Delaware called MagneGas Energy Solutions, LLC and MagneGas Welding Supply, LLC, respectively. MagneGas Energy Solutions, LLC was formed to acquire another company but the acquisition did not occur, so the Company will be used for future purposes. Magnegas Welding Supply, LLC was formed to be the holding company for all of the Company’s other welding supply companies, ESSI, Complete Welding and Trico.

On March 3, 2017, the Company formed three wholly owned subsidiaries in the State of Delaware called MagneGas Real Estate Holdings, LLC, MagneGas IP, LLC and MagneGas Production, LLC, respectively. Magnegas Real Estate Holdings, LLC was formed to hold all future real estate for risk management purposes. Magnegas IP, LLC was formed to be the company that holds all of the consolidated entity’s intellectual property and Magnegas Production, LLC is the company where the gas is actually produced.
 
On December 13, 2017, the Company formed NG Enterprises Acquisition, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary formed under the laws of the State of California, for the purpose of acquiring all of the assets of GGNG Enterprises, Inc. The Company completed the acquisition on January 19, 2018, and commenced operations in San Diego, California, doing business under the name “Complete Welding San Diego”.
 
On February 12, 2018, the Company formed MWS Green Arc Acquisition, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary formed under the laws of the State of Texas for the purpose of acquiring all of the assets of Green Arc Supply, L.L.C. The Company completed the acquisition of the Green Arc Supply, L.L.C. assets on February 16, 2018 and commenced business operations in Texas and Louisiana doing business as “Green Arc Supply”.
 
Products
 
We currently sell two products: (i) our proprietary fuel, MagneGas2®, for use in the metal working industry, (ii) the machines that produce MagneGas2®, known as Plasma Arc Flow® refineries. In addition, the Company sells metal cutting fuels and ancillary products through ESSI, Complete Welding San Diego and Green Arc Supply.
Fuel
 
In the United States, we currently produce MagneGas2®, which is comprised primarily of hydrogen. The fuel can be used as an alternative to natural gas for metal cutting and other commercial uses. After production, the fuel is stored in hydrogen cylinders which are then sold to market on a rotating basis. Tests have confirmed that MagneGas2® cuts metal 38% faster than acetylene. The fuel has similar properties as acetylene making it easier for end users to adopt with limited training.
 
Our original fuel for the metal working industry was known as MagneGas®, however, we started selling MagneGas2® in July 2014 and stopped selling MagneGas® in March 2015.
 
Equipment
 
Our Plasma Arc Flow® System can gasify many forms of liquids and liquid waste such as used vegetable oils, ethylene glycol and sewage and sludge. The Plasma Arc Flow® refinery forces a high volume flow of liquid waste through an electric arc between carbon electrodes, which sterilizes the bio-contaminants within the waste without the need to add any chemical disinfecting agents. Another advantage of the Plasma Arc Flow® refinery is that it releases a clean burning fuel while sterilizing the liquid. We have configured our Plasma Arc Flow® refineries in various sizes from 50kw to 500kw for broad applications. Plasma Arc Flow® refineries range in price from $500,000 to $5 million.
Strategy
 
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available and that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision–making group in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer. The Company discusses three major marketing initiatives below. Even though we discuss discrete initiatives they are actually three product offerings and in fact the Company operates in one segments.

Research and Development
 
Sterilization System for Agricultural Use
 
In early 2015, the Company completed a new generation of mobile systems for use with the sterilization of manures and sewage waste. It has developed a new 50kw Venturi® System which was tested at a major hog farm in Indiana. The Company conducted multiple successful tests at the farm with increasing flow and efficiency rates. The pilot plant achieved what was expected, namely, full sterilization of manures processed through the 50kw pilot system. The Company made a presentation regarding this new sterilization system to officials from the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) in early 2016. The officials indicated that there are grant programs available for these types of projects and the Company retained a consultant to assist it in the grant application process. The Company submitted an initial grant application on May 10, 2016. On June 13, 2017, the Company was awarded a $431,874 grant from the USDA. The grant will be used to accelerate the commercialization of MagneGas’ plasma arc Venturi® sterilization system for the treatment of pathogens and nutrients found in animal biosolid wastes.
Increased System Efficiency for Greater Fuel Output
 
The Company continues to explore methods to increase efficiency and reduce the cost of the production of its fuels. This effort is ongoing and includes exploring various power systems, filtration systems and conversion of certain byproducts into electricity for reduced operational cost.
 
MagneGas2 ® for the Co-Combustion of Hydro-Carbon Fuels to Reduce Emissions
 
The Company has completed internal testing both in the United States and Australia on the effect of combusting MagneGas2® with hydrocarbon fuel exhaust and has demonstrated reduced hydrocarbon emissions and increased heat with the co-combustion of coal and other hydrocarbon fuels and MagneGas2®.
 
On September 13, 2014 the Company and FuturEnergy PTY, LTD of Australia signed a term sheet to form a Joint Venture (“JV LLC Australia”) for the purposes of pursuing the co-combustion of MagneGas2® fuel with hydrocarbon fuels to reduce emissions through co-combustion of MagneGas2® fuel including diesel, gasoline and coal. On March 20, 2015, the Company and FuturEnergy PTY, LTD finalized a term sheet (the “March 2015 Term Sheet”) with a confidential party from Michigan for a tri-party joint venture implemented through a Delaware limited liability company (the “JV LLC”). Each party owns one-third of the JV LLC which is engaged in the worldwide testing, development, and pursuit of the co-combustion of MagneGas2® with coal and coal by-products in the electric power plant industry. The March 2015 Term Sheet was due to expire on December 31, 2015 unless the three parties agreed to extend the term. On December 26, 2015, the parties agreed to extend the March 2015 Term Sheet until December 31, 2016. The extension allows the parties to attain verification by an independent agency of the co-combustion technology by December 31, 2016.
