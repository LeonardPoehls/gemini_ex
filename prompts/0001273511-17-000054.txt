Item 1.
Business

We are primarily engaged in acquiring mineral assets and applying green innovation to traditional mining methods and combining renewable energy and technology into the process. 

Overview

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 21, 2005, under the name Nava Resources, Inc. for the purpose of conducting mineral exploration activities. We were authorized to issue 400,000,000 shares of common stock, having a par value of $0.001 per share. On January 4, 2007, we obtained written consent from our shareholders to amend our Articles of Incorporation to change the par value of our common stock from $0.001 to $0.00001 per share, which change was effected on February 28, 2007. Effective July 30, 2013, we changed our name from Nava Resources, Inc. to Blox Inc..

Description of Property

Mansounia Property, Guinea, West Africa

On August 6, 2014, we announced that we entered into a Deed of Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated July 24, 2014 (the "Assumption Agreement") with Joseph Boampong Memorial Institute Ltd. ("JBMIL") and Equus Mining Ltd. ("EML"), Burey Gold Guinee sarl ("BGGs") and Burey Gold Limited ("BGL") and, collectively with EML and BGGs, (the "Vendors"), pursuant to which we agreed to assume JBMIL's right to acquire a 78% beneficial interest in the Mansounia Concession (the "Mansounia Property") from the Vendors, which right was exercised. 

The Mansounia Property lies in the southwest margin of the Siguiri Basin, in the Kouroussa Prefecture, Kankan Region, in Guinea, West Africa and covers a surface area of 145 square kilometres. The Mansounia Property is located approximately 80 kilometres west, by road, from the country's third largest city, Kankan. The Mansounia Property has a mineral resource estimate of 1.29Moz above a 0.4 g/t Au cut-off grade classified as indicated and inferred (reported by Runge Limited in accordance with the JORC guidelines and code for the Reporting or Mineral Resource Estimates, 2011). The total concession covers an area of 145km2 and is largely unexplored.

An exploration permit for the Mansounia Property was granted by the Ministère des Mines et de la Géologie on August 20, 2013. On October 25, 2016, an exploration permit extension was granted for a period of 12-months. The purpose of the extension was to provide time to complete the required feasibility study and environmental impact assessment that will be submitted to Ministre des Mines et de la Géologie and the La Ministre de lEnvironnement, des Eaux et Forêts. Work has commenced on the feasibility study and a consultant has been engaged to commence the environmental impact assessment. It is our intention to obtain an exploitation permit, which would give us the exclusive right to mine and dispose of minerals for 15 years, with a possible five-year extension. In February 2017, our directors and management teams from Vancouver and Guinea met in Accra, Ghana, to further the process of advancing a project viability study for the Mansounia Property. The environmental impact assessment of the concession is in progress. Once completed, the results of these two studies will be presented to the Guinea Ministry of Mines and Geology and the Environmental Protection Agency in Guinea, with a view to advancing towards an exploitation license. 

In consideration for the acquisition of the interest in the Mansounia Property, we paid $100,000 to BGL and $40,000 to EML and on July 31, 2014, issued BGL and EML an aggregate of 6,514,350 shares of common stock of our company (the "First Tranche Shares"), at a deemed price of $0.1765 per share, for an aggregate deemed value of $1,150,000. The First Tranche Shares were issued to BGL and EML in the proportions of 71.43% and 28.57%, respectively. For accounting purposes, we recorded the cash payment of $150,000 plus $781,722 as the fair value of the First Tranche Shares in mineral interest. The fair value of the First Tranche Shares was based on the closing price of our shares on the OTCQB on July 24, 2014.

Within 14 days of commercial gold production being publicly declared from ore mined from the Mansounia Property, we will issue BGL and EML a second tranche of shares of our common stock (the "Second Tranche Shares"). The number of Second Tranche Shares to be issued shall be calculated by dividing $1,150,000 by the volume weighted average share price of our common stock over a 20-day period preceding the issuance date. The Second Tranche Shares shall be issued to BGL and EML in the proportions of 71.43% and 28.57%, respectively.

The field program scheduled last year for the Mansounia Property has now been completed with results pending. Crews were on the ground at Mansounia undertaking geological traverses and collecting soil and rock grab samples. Those samples have now been sent to the laboratory for analysis. No results were available as at the date of this Form 10-K Annual Report.

In May 2017, we announced the results of a field reconnaissance program over our central and southern Mansounia Property areas, which has resulted in confirmation of the existence of local anomalism for gold and minor occurrences of free gold (in-excess of 20ppb - geological background values). For full results, see the table below. The results are preliminary in nature and not conclusive evidence of the likelihood of the occurrence of a mineral deposit.

Based on the highly encouraging results obtained from historical soils geochemical programs and in-line with recent desktop and field studies undertaken by Spiers Geological Consultants (SGC 2016), a number of key target areas were identified for follow-up field activities. Our understanding of the deposit and surrounding areas continues to grow with each field season, and, to date, robust geological and structural context for the area/s have been developed using modelling software. The model is based on, and continually refined, using the pre-existing regional geochemical soil and rock chip sampling and drill-hole data from the Mansounia Property area. Further funding is required to explore these new target areas, which is now a priority for management.

Pramkese, Osenase and Asamankese, Ghana, West Africa

On June 22, 2013, we entered into a share purchase agreement with Waratah Investments Limited (Waratah) whereby we agreed purchase all of Waratahs right, title, and interest in the Quivira Gold (Quivira) shares, of which Waratah holds 100% of the outstanding shares. As consideration for the Quivira shares, we agreed to issue to Waratah 60,000,000 shares of common stock and 60,000,000 warrants. Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one additional common share at $0.05 for a period of five years from the closing date. Quivira, a subsidiary of Waratah, owns and operates gold and diamond mining properties in Ghana.

The closing of the agreement is subject to the completion of a private placement financing of up to $1,500,000, consisting of units priced at $0.05 per unit, with each unit to be comprised of one common share and one share purchase warrant, exercisable at $0.05 for five years. Closing the Agreement is also conditional upon receiving legal opinions of Ghana counsel confirming various matters relating to the laws of Ghana, including corporate and title opinions; the Company receiving legal opinions of Australian counsel confirming various matters relating to the laws of Australia, including corporate and title opinions; completion of certain ongoing transactions by Quivira relating to the transfer of title to certain assets and to an assignment of debt; and preparation of U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statements for Quivira.

Our directors conducted their first visit to Ghana in August 2015, when they visited the Birim Region where the three Ghanaian concessions are located. The objective was to carry out a geological reconnaissance over the areas to identify potentially favourable lithologies. The directors inspected the existing field programs in Ghana and oversaw the planning and implementation of programs for the near future.

Research and Development Activities

In addition to activities associated with the Mansounia Project, we have been involved with research and development studies relating to the other key pillars of the business, namely: technology, energy and expansion in Africa. Management is keen to develop new businesses in these key areas as they form part of our overall mandate. Diversifying into new (non-mining) markets, such as energy and technology, and expanding our presence in Africa offers a range of potential benefits. It is the opinion of management that establishing new revenue streams in several arenas will not only benefit our company as a whole but will also help insulate it from fluctuations in the price of precious metals.

We are currently working closely with strategic partners to develop our own, in-house tenement management software system to provide semi-automated, accurate, timely and compliant reporting on our four mining concessions in West Africa. As part of the Quivira Gold acquisition that also included Strategic Marketing Australia and the bespoke ERP software system, Abacus, we also have the right to acquire a 50% interest in Post One, an electronic document transfer system. Although Post One is still in the research and development stage, management believes that it has the potential to fill a gap in the manner in which professionals exchange sensitive and notarised documents and could create a potential future income stream for the Company.

Since inception, we have been committed to greening the mining process through the utilisation of new, clean and sustainable technologies. Our aim is to significantly reduce the carbon emissions from any future mining operations, where possible and efficacious, to produce green gold and market it as such. Initially, this can be partially achieved with the use of alternative energy sources at the mine site and camp. Guinea is the watershed of West Africa and we plan to work with experts to explore the option of investing in hydro-electric power for our Mansounia Property, to initially replace part, and ultimately all, of the conventional diesel power generation or coal-fired grid power that will be utilised in our future operations. 
 
Green or small-scale hydropower is deemed in the USA to be a plant that generates less than 30MW. Hydropower utilizes moving water to generate electricity and has been used  particularly in isolated areas  for many decades. Small-scale hydropower systems can be installed in small rivers, streams or in the existing water supply networks. As opposed to large-scale hydropower systems, small-scale hydropower can be installed with negligible environmental impact on existing ecosystems.

In the first instance, we will aim to supply approximately 2.5MW to satisfy the demand of the initial power requirements of the project. With additional funding, it may be possible to scale this up to 10MW to allow for expansion of our production. A 20MW hydroelectric power plant would offer the potential to sell excess power (surplus to mine requirements) into the Guinean power grid and return an additional income to our company. A scoping study to examine the opportunities for small-scale hydropower around Mansounia will be commenced in the near future.

We also have a strong commitment to wealth creation, prosperity and education for locals within the catchment areas of our concessions both in Guinea and Ghana. Part of our mandate includes:

·
 providing education and training to allow locals to gain employment on our future mine sites;
 ·
 offering English language and mathematics courses;
 ·
 providing additional infrastructure such as housing, roads and energy where possible, in accordance with our sustainability goals; and
 ·
 implementing the United Nations 17 goals for Sustainable Development and Growth (UN17 SDG) across all our projects for the benefit of locals and as examples of how green, responsible mining can be carried out.

Geological and Technical Consultants 

Robert Spiers has held a number of senior Geologist and mine management positions, over the last 25 years, with companies in Australia and across the world, operating in a broad range of commodities, including gold. He has a vast degree of experience in all aspects of project valuation, resource estimation, exploration planning and management, resource development programs, construction and application of 3D geological models with utilization in the estimation and extraction of ore bodies. Mr. Spiers is also a Competent Person (Qualified Person) under the JORC 2012 Code & Guidelines and the NI 43-101 instrument for the reporting of Mineral Resource Estimates. 

We also intend to retain qualified persons on a contract basis as needed to assist us with our exploration activities, including the survey, exploration, excavation of any mineral property we may acquire. We do not presently have any verbal or written agreement regarding the retention of any such persons.

Competitive Conditions

The mineral exploration business is an extremely competitive industry. We are competing with many other exploration companies looking for minerals. We are a very early stage mineral exploration company and a very small participant in the mineral exploration business. Being a junior mineral exploration company, we compete with other companies like ours for financing and joint venture partners. Additionally, we compete for resources such as professional geologists, camp staff, helicopters and mineral exploration supplies. 
Government Approvals and Recommendations

Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national and local laws and regulations in West Africa, which govern prospecting, development, exploitation, production, export, taxes, labour standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We intend to secure all necessary permits for the Mansounia Property.

Our activities are also subject to various federal and state/provincial laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. We intend to conduct business with a view to safeguarding public health and the environment and operating in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We will generally be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, resloping and revegetating various portions of a site after mining operations are completed. These reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. Changes to current l laws and regulations in West Africa could in the future require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects.

Guineas National Transition Council (CTN) amended its mining code in April 2013, in an effort to improve its investment record. The amendments brought profit taxes down to 30 percent, and cut the tax on bauxite to 0.15 percent of the international market price for aluminum. However, the new version still contains the controversial clause, which grants the government a free 15-percent stake in mining projects, as well as the option of purchasing an additional 20 percent stake. The clause is designed to encourage companies to process raw materials inside the sovereigns borders, rather than just shipping the ore out. The states stake in the projects is said to shrink as the portion of value added inside the countrys borders increases. 

Under the new mining code, an industrial exploitation or operating permit will be granted for 15 years. It can be renewed for five-year periods, provided the holder of the title complies with its obligations. Upon non-commencement of work within a year of the issuance of an exploitation permit for industrial operations, the previous monthly fine of GNF5m has been revised to GNF10m, imposed for the first three months, with a monthly increase of 10 percent of the penalty amount thereafter.

Mining convention: The granting of a mining concession and an exploitation permit must be accompanied by the mining convention. The maximum duration of a mining convention is 25 years, renewable for one or several periods of 10 years. Mining conventions are subject to an executive order and will be signed by the Minister of Mines, following the advice of the National Mining Committee and the authorization of the Council of Ministers. Mining conventions will then be submitted for the legal opinion of the Supreme Court and ratified by Parliament.

Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws

Although we currently have no costs to comply with environmental laws concerning our mineral property, we will have to sustain the cost of reclamation and environmental remediation for all work undertaken which causes sufficient surface disturbance to necessitate reclamation work.  Both reclamation and environmental remediation refer to putting disturbed ground back as close to its original state as possible.  Other potential pollution or damage must be cleaned and renewed along standard guidelines outlined in the usual permits.  Reclamation is the process of bringing the land back to a natural state after completion of exploration activities.  Environmental remediation refers to the physical activity of taking steps to remediate, or remedy, any environmental damage caused, i.e. refilling trenches after sampling or cleaning up fuel spills.  At this time, we do not require any reclamation or remediation other than minor clean up and removal of supplies because of minimal disturbance to the ground.  The amount of these costs is not known at this time as we do not know the extent of the exploration program we will undertake.  Because there is presently no information on the size, tenor, or quality of any resource or reserve at this time, it is impossible to assess the impact of any capital expenditures on our earnings or competitive position in the event a potentially economic deposit is discovered.
Employees

We currently have no employees. Our officers and directors provide consulting services to us on a part time basis. We intend to retain the services of geologists, prospectors and consultants on a contract basis to conduct the exploration programs on our mineral claims and to assist with regulatory compliance and preparation of financial statements.
