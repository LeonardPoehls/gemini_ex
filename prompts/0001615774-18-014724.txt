As part of the Assets acquired, we acquired ownership of FOREXWARE, the primary software suite and technology solution which powers the FXDD brand globally today. We also have ownership of the FOREXWARE brand name. We have also acquired ownership of the customer interface and other software trading solutions being used by FXDD.com. By virtue of our relationship with FXDD Malta and FXDirectDealer LLC (“FXDIRECT”), we provide turnkey software and technology solutions for FXDD.com. We offer the customers of FXDD 24 hour, five days a week direct access to the global over the counter (“OTC”) FX market, which is a decentralized market in which participants trade directly with one another, rather than through a central exchange.
 
In an FX trade, participants effectively buy one currency and simultaneously sell another currency, with the two currencies that make up the trade being referred to as a “currency pair”. Our software and technology solutions enable FXDD to present its customers with price quotations on over the counter tradeable instruments, including over the counter currency pairs, and also provide our customers the ability to trade FX derivative contracts on currency pairs through a product referred to as Contracts for Difference (“CFD”). Our software solutions also offer other CFD products, including CFDs on metals, such as gold, and on futures linked to other products.
 
We currently plan to seek for acquisitions that bring shareholder value both in the short term and long term. Our goal is to create an industry leading sector consolidated platform, combining strong global retail and institutional trading flows covering FX, commodities, futures, CFD and equities, with a cutting edge technological product suite, turnkey software and technological development capabilities.

The Market Opportunity
 
The FX market is a global, decentralized market for the trading of currencies. FX trading involves the simultaneous buying and selling of a currency pair for the purposes of hedging currency risk or to generate a profit. The FX market, once limited to large financial institutions, has expanded and matured over the past decade, and now captures a wide range of participants, including central banks, commercial banks, non-bank corporations, hedge funds, brokers and individual investors / traders. The market’s expansion has helped lead to a significant increase in trading activity. In addition to the increase in the breadth of market participants, key factors driving higher trading volumes include the adoption of electronic and high frequency trading, tighter trading spreads, rising volatility among currencies and enhanced access to FX trading markets – primarily through online brokers, such as FXDD – for retail investors.
 
FX trading, initially utilized primarily for hedging purposes, has evolved as investor sophistication levels have risen, trading costs have fallen, and as currencies have become increasingly viewed as a viable investment asset class. FX’s low, (or even negative) correlation among certain other portfolio assets, namely equities and fixed income, may help investors reduce overall portfolio volatility. As such, we believe that currencies are often viewed as an important portfolio diversification tool.
 
Fueled by the growing adoption of the internet, the retail segment of the FX market began to emerge in the late 1990s. Developing online brokerage firms provided individual investors with direct access to the global FX markets. Prior to the development of these trading platforms, individual retail investors were effectively locked out of the FX market as minimum trade sizes were typically too high for individual retail investors. Online FX brokers lowered the minimum volume barriers and transactions costs for retail trading, allowing individuals to establish trading accounts with much lower initial deposits. We believe the retail FX segment now represents the fastest growing portion of the overall FX market. We believe this growth will be driven by a handful of key market trends, including:
 

● | Increased investor demand for exposure to currencies;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing internet adoption across the globe;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | Growing engagement of the “offline” market;
--+--------------------------------------------


● | Development of emerging markets and the emergence of an affluent middle class; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing regulation resulting in greater confidence.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 
Participants in the retail FX market are geographically dispersed. Retail FX brokers, such as FXDD are seeking to expand their presence in projected high growth regional areas, such as Asia and the Middle East.

Nukkleus, by arrangement pursuant to our services agreement with FXDD Malta Limited and FXDIRECT, provides to FXDD Malta Limited clients an introducing broker (IB) network spread across China, Japan and the Middle East. Our approach to the retail FX market is to focus on the development of relationships with independent local referring brokers who provide a recurring source of new customers. These referring brokers do not have an exclusive relationship with us, but are offered a competitive commission structure to deliver new customers to us. Our account managers primarily focus on building relationships with referring brokers, and master referring brokers (who refer other referring brokers to us), as well as with customers referred to us by referring brokers and acquired by us directly. We believe this approach, in contrast to retail FX brokers that focus solely or primarily on acquiring accounts through online marketing campaigns, has allowed us to provide services to FXDD Malta Limited, which allows entities to achieve strong levels of net trading income, and accounts, as well as lower up front customer acquisition costs and greater customer satisfaction. Referring brokers are typically either individuals who are current or former FX traders or individuals or companies active in the area of FX trading and education and investment services advisory business.

We obtained the services of account managers by virtue of our services agreement with FXDirectDealer LLC. Account managers are compensated to a significant degree based on their performance, measured by net deposits inflows, new accounts funded and trading volume generated by customers. We believe that this compensation structure motivates our account managers and leads to more active communication with our referring brokers and customers, an improved customer trading experience, improved referring broker and customer retention and increased deposits.

The XWare Liquidity Bridge: With the XWare liquidity bridge, brokers can automatically submit trade requests to the liquidity provider of choice and receive confirmation prior to sending an accept or reject message to the broker’s client.

Brokers can create unique price streams from aggregated liquidity with sophisticated control over liquidity sources, pricing models, execution models and risk management.
