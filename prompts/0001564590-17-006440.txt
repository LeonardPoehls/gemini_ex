Overview
 We are a leading provider of enterprise-class, cloud-based incentive compensation solutions for employee and sales performance management. We address a critical business need: to incentivize employees and align their behaviors with company goals. Our solutions allow organizations to make better strategic decisions, optimize behaviors, increase sales and employee performance, improve margins, increase operational efficiencies, mitigate risk, design better incentive compensation plans and reduce error rates in incentive compensation calculations. We were the first 100% cloud-based, multi-tenant provider focusing solely on the incentive compensation and employee and sales performance management market and we achieved our leadership position through domain expertise and innovative technology. We deliver our solutions through a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business model.
 We believe that our solutions are strategic for our customers. We go beyond automation by providing our customers with commercially actionable insights so that they can optimize their employees’ behaviors. We believe that we are the first and only company to make commercially available insights derived from an empirical set of aggregated and anonymized data which helps customers make fact-based decisions to motivate employees and drive business performance. Our solutions help executives design, manage and analyze incentive programs and provide visibility into employee and incentive program performance. At the same time, employees use our solutions to monitor, estimate and track their own and their team’s performance in real-time and modify their behaviors to maximize their payout consistent with company goals.
 The design and management of incentive compensation is often highly complex. Traditional systems such as spreadsheets, manual processes and homegrown solutions are inadequate to deal with the complexity associated with variable forms of pay, such as commissions, bonuses and non-cash rewards. According to an August 2014 research study by Aon Hewitt, 91% of organizations currently offer a variable pay program for their broad based employee populations and expect to spend 13% of payroll on variable pay. Further, according to Aon Hewitt, variable pay budgets and spending have nearly doubled in the last 20 years.
 We have a diverse and rapidly growing customer base ranging from FORTUNE 50 enterprises to small, emerging companies in a variety of industries such as business & financial services, communications, high-tech manufacturing, life sciences, retail, travel & hospitality, media & internet and SaaS & traditional software, which provides us with large, unique, industry-specific data sets. Customers use our solutions to manage and incent a broad range of employees, from bank tellers to post office employees to sales people.
 We strive to be a thought leader in incentives and employee performance, identifying and interpreting emerging trends, shaping and guiding industry dialogue, and creating and sharing best practices. Our thought leadership is based on our big-data insights as well as our significant industry experience. We deliver our thought leadership and innovation through the expertise of our employees as well as the authoring and dissemination of information about incentives that complement and leverage our technology solutions. We believe our thought leadership differentiates us and allows us to increase the value of our solutions to our customers.
 As of January 31, 2017, we had approximately 297,000 subscribers, compared to approximately 266,000 subscribers as of January 31, 2016, representing an increase of approximately 12%. While approximately 56% of our customers were enterprise and mid-market companies, we derived approximately 92% of our revenue from enterprise and mid-market customers for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017. As of January 31, 2017, we had approximately 980 customers.
 We offer our solutions on a subscription basis, typically through non-cancellable contracts with one to three year terms, which provides us with visibility into a substantial portion of our future revenue. We had total revenue of $95.5 million, $76.0 million and $61.1 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, resulting in year-over-year increases of 26% and 24%. Our subscription revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $73.0 million, $59.2 million and $47.3 million, respectively, resulting in year-over-year increases of 23% and 25%. Our professional services revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $22.5 million, $16.8 million and $13.8 million, respectively, resulting in year-over-

year increases of 34% and 22%. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017, our subscription services revenue accounted for 76% of total revenue and our professional services revenue accounted for the remaining 24%. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments to support our growth and public company requirements, and accordingly have incurred net losses of $16.9 million, $24.7 million and $18.5 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 Our Solutions
 We provide cloud-based incentive compensation solutions for employee and sales performance management. Our solutions include the following key attributes:
  
• | Automation. A fundamental purpose of automating incentive processes is to reduce errors and inefficiencies that result from manual or spreadsheet based systems. Our solutions automate costly and cumbersome processes, such as estimating and calculating commissions and bonuses, assigning sales territories, forecasting accruals and modeling business outcomes. As a result, our solutions enhance productivity by allowing companies to focus on the strategic aspects of incentive compensation. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Intuitive user experience. We designed the user interface and user workflows of our solutions to align with the way users naturally think and act. Our solutions are designed for use by the entire workforce, including top executives, sales, finance and human resources employees. Our focus on an intuitive and simple user experience enables the adoption of our solutions by even novice users with minimal training. We believe that we enable our customers to generate higher productivity and better business results through broad access to more timely and reliable information. For example, our solutions include gamification elements, such as leaderboards and badges, which encourage employees to exceed goals. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mobility. We offer mobile solutions for phones and tablets across the major operating systems so our subscribers have convenient, anytime, anywhere access to real-time performance information, allowing them to optimize their performance no matter where and when. We believe these characteristics result in greater user adoption and higher utilization of our solutions. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalable, secure and reliable cloud architecture. Our solutions are 100% cloud-based, built upon a multi-tenant, single instance architecture. A multi-tenant architecture is one that allows multiple customers to use the same hardware and software infrastructure. Our platform architecture allows all of our customers to use a single and most updated version of our solutions, which enables us to accelerate our speed of implementation, upgrades and support. Because we do not need to customize, make improvements or upgrade our solutions for individual customers, our customers benefit from greater scalability, reliability and performance. Our customers have access to Xactly Trust, our trust site that provides real-time availability monitoring of our solutions, including privacy and security information and uptime. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Data integration with other business applications. Our open application program interfaces (APIs) allow our customers to integrate our solutions into their existing business processes and systems. Our customers use our APIs to import data into our solutions from customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), human capital management (HCM) and configure price quote (CPQ) solutions, such as those provided by Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), Oracle Corporation (Oracle), salesforce.com, inc. (Salesforce), SAP AG (SAP) and Workday, Inc. (Workday), as well as to extract data from our solutions for use in CRM, finance and payroll solutions such as those provided by Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Ceridian HCM Holding Inc. (Ceridian) and Paychex, Inc. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Actionable big data. We believe that we are the only company that has empirical incentive compensation data combined with the associated metadata across companies and multiple industries. We anonymize and aggregate the data from the billions of transactions we process annually, allowing us to provide value-added, commercially actionable insights. Our customers can use this information to design optimal incentive compensation programs to drive the right behaviors and maximize business results. Metadata is the information necessary to interpret large amounts of data and relate sets of data to others to determine correlations. Without this metadata, it is extremely difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from big data.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technology Infrastructure and Operations
 We believe that our cloud-based, SaaS solutions enable us to develop and deliver functionality to customers more efficiently than traditional on-premise enterprise software vendors can. We have designed true multi-tenant cloud solutions and we have built our solutions on a modular, secure, highly available and scalable platform.
 We build our solutions using service-oriented architecture principles and employ proprietary and third-party technologies. Our applications are written in industry-standard software programming languages including a standardized Java-based development environment, Hadoop and SQL relational database query language. We use commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary, open source and commercially available software to provide our service. We have a purpose-built, modular, service-oriented platform that allows us to 
 9


balance customer workloads tuned to our specific environment, allowing us to continue to scale in a fault-tolerant fashion. The platform architecture is designed to allow us to provide the high levels of uptime required by our customers, and to meet or exceed our 99.7% uptime commitment in our service-level agreements, excluding planned downtime. Our customers can access our solutions through mobile devices or through any certified web browser without installing or downloading applets.
 Our solutions treat all customers as logically separate tenants utilizing shared application services and databases. We are able to spread the cost of delivering our service across our user base. In addition, because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications or application versions with their own business logic and database schemas, we can rapidly scale our business. As a result, we are able to simultaneously and seamlessly update our solutions for all our customers.
 Our solution is flexible. Every page is dynamically rendered for each user, adhering to role-based security settings, including dynamic currency conversion support. As a result, our solution can display different views of data based on a number of factors, including user, department and area of responsibility in the company. We have also developed extensive reporting and analytics functionality that provides near real-time analysis of a customer’s data.
 Our solutions can be integrated into other applications using secure internet network protocols. Through our platform, we allow customers and partners to insert, update, delete and query information in our solutions. We also have mechanisms to protect and govern the use of our solutions to ensure that all customers, regardless of size, have access to our solutions.
 Security is central to our solutions and includes physical security, network security, application security and security at our third-party data centers. Our security measures are audited as part of our Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16 (SSAE-16) SOC 1 Type II attestations by a third-party auditor. In addition, our customers only interact with our solutions over secure internet protocols.
 We serve all our customers and subscribers from primary data centers located in Virginia and Northern California. Both data centers are SSAE-16 SOC 2 Type II and SOC 1 Type II audited and are secured by around-the-clock guards, biometric access screening and escort-controlled access, and are supported by on-site backup generators in the event of a power failure, with fully redundant heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems.
 Research and Development
 Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development and our ability to rapidly introduce new applications, technologies, features and functionality into our solutions. Our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing our existing service offerings by working closely with our customers, conducting quality assurance testing and improving our core technology as well as developing new proprietary services and solutions. Performance, security, functional depth and breadth, and usability of our solutions drive our technology decisions and product development.
 We devote a significant portion of our resources to research and development. Research and development expenses were $18.2 million, $15.7 million and $11.9 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 Competition
 The market for incentive compensation solutions for employee and sales performance management is evolving, highly competitive and significantly fragmented. With the introduction of new technologies and the potential entry of new competitors into the market, we expect competition to increase and intensify in the future, which could harm our ability to increase sales, maintain or increase renewals and maintain our prices.
 We compete primarily with companies offering incentive compensation and employee and sales performance management applications via hybrid cloud-based and on-premise solutions. We also compete with spreadsheets, homegrown systems, and toolsets and products developed by software providers that allow customers to build new 
 10


applications that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our competitors include Callidus Software Inc. (Callidus), Cognos, a division of International Business Machines Corporation (Cognos) and Oracle, as well as several other privately held companies.
 We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
  
• | technology architecture (multi-tenant SaaS versus on-premise or hosted);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | level of customer satisfaction;
--+--------------------------------


• | ease of deployment;
--+--------------------


• | ease of use;
--+-------------


• | breadth and depth of application functionality;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | total costs of ownership;
--+--------------------------


• | pricing of solutions;
--+----------------------


• | brand awareness and reputation;
--+--------------------------------


• | sophistication of technology platform;
--+---------------------------------------


• | actionable insights through big data analytics;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | capability for customization, configurability, integration, security, scalability and reliability of applications;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | providing automated solutions instead of spreadsheets to address changes in accounting standards;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | domain expertise;
--+------------------


• | size of customer base and level of user adoption; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to integrate with legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our solutions and services. As of March 31, 2017, we had two issued U.S. patents and seven pending U.S. patent applications. We intend to pursue additional patent protection. We have registered trademarks for “Xactly,” the Xactly logo, “Inspire Performance,” and certain other marks in the U.S. and several other jurisdictions. We are also the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include “xactlycorp.com” and similar variations. We license software from third parties for integration into our solutions, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. All our employees and independent contractors are required to sign agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf are our property and assigning to us any ownership that they may claim in those works. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information.
Government Regulation
 We are subject to a number of federal, state and international laws and regulations regarding data governance and the privacy and protection of consumer data that affect companies conducting business on the internet. In particular, we historically relied upon the U.S.-EU and U.S. Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, related to personal data of European Union (EU) residents. In October 2015, the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor was invalidated by the EU Court of Justice and as a result, we are in the process of undertaking appropriate changes to our practices with respect to personal data as a result of this ruling. The U.S. and EU have recently agreed to a data transfer agreement referred to as the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield, designed to replace the invalidated U.S.-EU Safe Harbor. The 
 11


U.S.-EU Privacy Shield has recently become effective, but it is not clear that we will find it appropriate to utilize as a mechanism to legitimize data transfers from the European Economic Area (EEA) to the U.S. We are engaging in other measures to legitimize our transfers of personal data from the EEA to the U.S. in the interim. 
 In addition, many of our customers and potential customers, including those in the healthcare, financial services and other industries are subject to substantial regulation in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions regarding their collection, use and protection of data and may be the subject of further regulation in the future. These various laws and regulations are often evolving and sometimes conflict. Many international and domestic laws require notification to users when there is a security breach of their sensitive personal data. Other domestic and foreign laws and regulations require the adoption and maintenance of information security standards to protect certain types of data. We expect the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations to increase in the future as a result of additional laws and regulations and changes in legal interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations, or any laws or regulations that may be promulgated in the future, may subject us to significant liabilities and fines.
 Employees
 As of January 31, 2017, we had 450 employees, with 119 in research and development, 160 in sales and marketing, 128 in operations, customer support and professional services and 43 in general and administrative.

 In May 2015, we established the XactlyOne Foundation as a non-profit organization, and we issued 50,000 shares of our common stock to it. The proposed programs of the XactlyOne Foundation include grants, volunteerism and other projects. We believe the XactlyOne Foundation will foster employee morale, strengthen our community presence and provide increased brand visibility. We incurred a non-cash expense of $0.5 million in fiscal 2016 equal to the fair value of the shares of our common stock issued to the XactlyOne Foundation.
