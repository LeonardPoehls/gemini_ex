ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Overview 
 
Bravatek Solutions, Inc., a Colorado corporation (the “Company"), was incorporated on April 19, 2007. Effective October 23, 2015, the Company changed its name to "Bravatek Solutions, Inc." in order to better reflect the Company's expanding operations and strategy. The Company's business operations are oriented around the marketing and distribution of proprietary and allied security, defense and information security software, tools and systems, including telecom services. Solutions span a diverse variety of world-wide markets including, but not limited to, email security, user authentication, telecommunications and cyber breach protection.
Principal Products 
 
Bravatek’s primary business focus centers on security, defense, and information security solutions that assist corporate entities, governments and individuals in protecting their organizations and/or critical infrastructure against both physical and cyber-attacks. The Company's business operations are oriented around the marketing and distribution of proprietary and allied security, defense and information security software, tools and systems (including services). To date, the Company has earned limited revenue. The Company believes the majority of its revenues will be derived from sales of proprietary and allied products and services to large enterprises, government, and military customers within the United States (“U.S.”) and abroad. 
 
Currently, the Company's primary business operations are focused on establishing a strategic leadership position in cybersecurity email solutions and telecom services within the U.S. and abroad. The Company also has a “Market Alliance Program” (“MAP”) that enables Bravatek to rapidly introduce additional allied software, tools and systems to the worldwide marketplace through “win-win” contracts offering Bravatek, in virtually all cases, exclusive distribution rights in specified markets.
 
Currently, the Company's primary proprietary product development efforts are focused on enhancing its sales-released enterprise-level information security software-appliance called Ecrypt One. It was designed to protect email and attachments in transit and at rest. It incorporates and supports multiple security technologies and techniques, such as encryption, role based access controls, server rules that enforce security, and multi-factor authentication. It was designed, with our rigorous new product development process, to assist organizations and governments to meet and maintain compliance with information security regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Care Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). 
 
The Company has filed patent applications for multiple attributes and processes contained in Ecrypt One.
 
On June 2, 2015, the Company completed an acquisition of some of the assets of Viking Telecom Services, LLC (“Viking Telecom”). The Company now provides telecom services under a new Viking Telecom brand. Services provided by Viking Telecom include cellular tower mapping and audits, ground audits, civil equipment installation, cellular site decommissioning, 3G/4G installations, project/construction management, battery installation and maintenance, shelter and compound preventative maintenance, site cleanup, and other related services. 
 
Research and Development 
 
Over the next twelve (12) months, Bravatek will continue developing new strategic alliances and strengthening existing strategic alliances. The Company also plans to continue developing enhancement upgrades to its proprietary cybersecurity product, Ecrypt One.
 
Production
 
Ecrypt One was developed using a proprietary, rigorous new product development process under the supervision of the Company’s CEO, Dr. Thomas A. Cellucci and Vice President of Product Development, Ian Treleaven. Solution testing and evaluation ("T&E") is routinely conducted by Ian Treleaven and the Company's development consultants using industry-standard tools and methods. The Company engages in technical meetings to address feedback from all T&E activities.

Distribution
 
The Company distributes its solutions globally, in accordance with applicable import and export regulations, through a number of distribution channels. The primary method of distribution is through a dedicated in-house sales force. The Company is also pursuing strategic distribution alliances with data centers, service providers, carrier dealers, consultants, and complementary solution providers to distribute its product. 
 
Additionally, the Company will list its solutions on the General Services Administration (“GSA”) Schedules or other government contract vehicles, for acquisition by authorized users. GSA is an independent agency of the United States government that, amongst other responsibilities, supplies products and communications for US government offices. The Company recently had its software related products and capabilities listed on the SEWP contract vehicle, administered by NASA, useable by many civilian and military agencies in the U.S.
 
Customers and Marketing 
 
Customers 
 
The Company offers products in multiple segments in government, business, and consumer markets. The majority of the allied products and services are targeted at government, military and business markets. 
 
The Company will primarily target Fortune 100 and 500 enterprises within the healthcare, financial/legal services, and telecommunications industries, as well as government, military and law enforcement agencies. These organizations have a critical reliance on security, defense, information security and data integrity products and services, and are subject to numerous stringent information security regulations. 
 
The Company anticipates that a majority of its customers will be large sized businesses. The Company also anticipates sales of its products and services to U.S. government and military organizations, and allied foreign government and military organizations like NATO. 
 
To date, the Company has received and fulfilled orders from corporate customers for Ecrypt One, Viking Telecom services, and partner solutions firms. 
 
Marketing 
 
Over the next twelve months, the Company will focus on orders and sales for its products and services. It will also continue to grow its strategic alliance network of allied products and service providers, who will also market Bravatek's products. 
 
The Company will focus its marketing efforts on customer acquisitions of Ecrypt One and Viking Telecom services, as well as allied products and services. The Company anticipates that it will continue to market its proprietary and allied products on the Internet, using the Company's websites (www.bravatek.com and www.vikingtelecomservices.com, not incorporated in this filing except as a reference), on social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, and on industry websites, blogs and forums. 
 
The Company also intends to expand its sales capabilities. 
 
Competition
 
Ecrypt One, the Company's enterprise-level information security server software package, is a very unique offering that faces indirect competition from companies such as: i) Symantec Corporation; ii) Voltage Security; iii) Proofpoint Inc.; iv) Axway Software; v) Watchguard; and, vi) Zix Corporation. 
 
All of the aforementioned companies develop and distribute email security servers. Although there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete with these organizations, our foremost advantage over these products is that Ecrypt One unifies multiple technologies and benefits (including email, encryption, anti-virus, anti-malware, no spam and no phishing) into a single solution making its use and administration more effective and efficient. 
 
Allied products and services face competition from a variety of companies. 
 
Although there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete with these organizations, our foremost advantage over competition is our network of potential customers, our ability to access them, and the diversity of high-tech products and services that the Company offers.

Intellectual Property and Agreements
 
Patents 
 
The Company has filed patent applications for multiple attributes and processes contained in Ecrypt One.
 
Licenses 
 
The research, development and commercialization of cybersecurity software often involves alternative development and optimization routes, which are presented at various stages in the development process. The preferred routes cannot be predicted at the outset of a research and development program because they will depend upon subsequent discoveries and test results. There are numerous third-party patents in our field, and it is possible that to pursue the preferred development route of one or more of our products we will need to obtain a license to a patent, which would decrease the ultimate profitability of the applicable product. If we cannot negotiate a license, we might have to pursue a less desirable development route or terminate the program altogether. 
Trade Secrets 
 
The Company also relies on trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position in our product areas. Bravatek employees, consultants and officers must sign a non-disclosure agreement before they are authorized to discuss particulars of the functionality of the Company's software products. All current employees, consultants and officers of the Company who are privy to confidential information have signed non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with the Company. 
Environmental Issues 
 
Through the provision of Viking Telecom services, the Company currently assists private sector clients to safely maintain, upgrade and install telecommunication towers, assemblies, and parts to enhance communications and protect the environment. 
 
The Company's software products and their production or provision thereof, do not directly impact the environment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company strives to be environmentally friendly in all aspects of its operations. 
 
Governmental Regulations 
 
Telecom services work performed under our Viking Telecom brand, is governed by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”). OSHA is a federal organization (part of the United States Department of Labor) that ensures safe and healthy working conditions for Americans by enforcing standards and providing workplace safety training. 
 
Created in response to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, OSHA's main goal is to protect the rights and safety of workers by preventing workplace injuries and deaths and holding employers accountable for safe workplaces. OSHA provides workers and employers with information about hazardous working conditions and they offer free assessment for workplace dangers. 
 
There is a strict set of federal safety standards to which all businesses must adhere. These regulations cover things like disposal of hazardous materials, required personal safety equipment such as safety goggles, permitted noise levels and fall protection. OSHA inspects workplaces to ensure they're following all regulations to reduce chances of accident or injury. 
 
Cybersecurity Software is classified as a "dual-use good," meaning that it can be used by both the general public and the military. Export of such goods is regulated by the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (the "Wassenaar Arrangement"). 
 
The Wassenaar Arrangement was established in order to contribute to regional and international security and stability by promoting transparency and greater responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies, thus preventing destabilizing accumulations. Participating States seek, through their national policies, to ensure that transfers of these items do not contribute to the development or enhancement of military capabilities, which undermine these goals, and are not diverted to support such capabilities.

The Participating States of the Wassenaar Arrangement include: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom and United States. 
 
In the United States, the Bureau of Industry and Security ("BIS") is responsible for implementing and enforcing the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR"), which regulate the export and re-export of most commercial items. Encryption software is subject to the EAR and other U.S. law, and may not be exported or re-exported to certain countries (currently Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria) or to persons or entities prohibited from receiving US exports. Because of this, the Company has applied and has received approval for Mass Market Status Export Authorization from the BIS. Mass Market Status is given to encryption products, which have been reviewed and classified by the BIS as exportable under certain rules and regulations, including the mass-market encryption rules of the EAR. 
 
The procurement and use of commercially available security solutions by government, and military agencies is controlled through various regulations. In order to provide or sell a service or product to a government or military agency, a vendor or provider can be approved by and listed with the United States General Services Administration (“GSA”) or other US government contract vehicles. Additionally, military applications also require that products be certified by the National Security Agency. The Company is pursuing such certifications and accreditations. The Company is also working with Steptoe & Johnson to determine other regulatory requirements for Ecrypt One enterprise-level information security soft-appliance. 
 
Employees
 
The Company currently has one full-time employee, its Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Thomas A. Cellucci. Deborah King is contracted to act as Interim Chief Financial Officer. Ian Treleaven is contracted to act as Vice President of Product Development of the Company. Various consultants have been contracted to fulfill sales, software development and web programming duties.
Reports to Security Holders
 
Once filed with the SEC, the Company provides its annual report that includes its audited financial information to its shareholders upon written request. The Company also makes its financial information equally available to any interested parties or investors through compliance with the disclosure rules of the Exchange Act. The Company is subject to disclosure filing requirements including filing Form 10-K's annually and Form 10-Q's quarterly. In addition, the Company files current reports on Form 8-K and other proxy and information statements from time to time as required.
 
The public may read and copy any materials that the Company files with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains a website (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
