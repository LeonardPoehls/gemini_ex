Overview 
 Quintana Energy Services Inc. (either individually or together with its subsidiaries, as the context requires, the Company, QES, we, us, and our) is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on April 13, 2017. Our accounting predecessor, Quintana Energy Services LP (QES LP), was formed as a Delaware partnership on November 3, 2014. In connection with our initial public offering (the IPO), we became the holding company for QES LP and its subsidiaries. See Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director IndependenceMaster Reorganization Agreement. We are a growth-oriented provider of diversified oilfield services to leading onshore oil and natural gas E&P companies operating in both conventional and unconventional plays in all of the active major basins throughout the United States. The following business segments comprise our primary services: (1) directional drilling services, (2) pressure pumping services, (3) pressure control services and (4) wireline services. Our directional drilling services enable efficient drilling and guidance of the horizontal section of a wellbore using our technologically-advanced fleet of downhole motors and 117 measurement while-drilling (MWD) kits. Our pressure pumping services include hydraulic fracturing, cementing and acidizing services, and such services are supported by a high-quality pressure pumping fleet of 245,925 hydraulic horsepower (HHP) as of December 31, 2017. Our primary pressure pumping focus is on large hydraulic fracturing jobs. Our pressure control services provide various forms of well control, form completions and workover applications through our 23 coiled tubing units, 36 rig-assisted snubbing units and ancillary equipment. As of December 31, 2017, our wireline services included 49 wireline units providing a full range of pump-down services in support of unconventional completions, and cased-hole wireline services enabling reservoir characterization. 
 Our operations are diversified by our broad customer base and expansive geographical reach. We currently operate throughout all active major onshore oil and gas basins in the United States and we served approximately 800 customers as of December 31, 2017. We have cultivated and maintain strong relationships with our E&P company customers, including leading companies such as EOG Resources, Pioneer Natural Resources Company, XTO Energy Inc., Parsley Energy Inc., Seneca Energy, LLC and Matador Resources Co. 
 Demand for our services has continued to improve since May 2016 as oil and natural gas prices have increased from previous levels and as the Baker Hughes Incorporated (Baker Hughes) U.S. land rig count has increased from 374 rigs on May 27, 2016 to 979 rigs as of March 23, 2018. Although our industry experienced a significant downturn beginning in late 2014 and remained depressed for a prolonged period, which materially adversely affected our results in 2015 and 2016, the rebound in demand and increasing rig count beginning in May 2016 has improved both activity levels and pricing for our services. Our revenue has increased each quarter from the quarter ended June 30, 2016 through the quarter ended December 31, 2017. From the second quarter of 2016 through the fourth quarter of 2017, our directional drilling services business segment increased the number of days we provided services to rigs and earned revenues during the period, including days that standby revenues were earned (rig days) by 166.5%, while day rates have improved from the lows we experienced during the second quarter of 2016. Moreover, through the downturn, we have steadily increased our market share in our directional drilling business services segment. We reactivated our second and third pressure pumping fleets in February and October 2017, respectively, and our frac utilization is approaching full utilization for our active fleets. In addition, in January 2018 we placed initial orders for twelve incremental frac pumps and ancillary equipment to redeploy our fourth pressure pumping fleet. Utilization of our pressure control and wireline assets has also continued to improve since the second quarter of 2016. 
 We used the downturn as an opportunity to optimize our cost structure and increase efficiency to better serve our customers. As part of these cost control initiatives, we closed unprofitable locations serving non-key regions, renegotiated supplier contracts and certain equipment leases to improve profitability and reduced general and administrative expenses. To improve operational efficiencies, we streamlined our internal processes and further improved customer focus. 
 Our Services 
 We classify the services we provide into four reportable business segments: (1) directional drilling services, (2) pressure pumping services, (3) pressure control services and (4) wireline services. We describe each of these segments below.

Directional Drilling Services 
 Our directional drilling services business segment provides the highly-technical and essential services of guiding horizontal and directional drilling operations for E&P companies. Directional drilling services enable E&P companies to drill horizontal wells that offer greater exposure to targeted reservoir horizons than vertical wells, and have become the standard means for drilling unconventional wells. According to Baker Hughes, 87% of all active rigs operating in the United States during the week ended March 23, 2018, were drilling horizontal wells, as compared to only 27% of active rigs as of ten years ago as of the same date. As of the quarter ended December 31, 2017, approximately 96% of our directional drilling activity is tied to follow-me rigs, which involve non-contractual, generally recurring services as our directional drilling team members follow a drilling rig from well-to-well or pad-to-pad for multiple wells, and in some cases, multiple years. With increasing use of pad drilling and reactivation of rigs, through the fourth quarter of 2017 we have increased the number of follow-me rigs from approximately 30 in the first quarter of 2016 to 55 as of December 31, 2017. Furthermore, increases in rig efficiency and multi-well pad drilling favor our directional drilling services business segment, which is now able to complete more jobs per year. 
 Our directional drilling services business segment is one of the largest independent providers of domestic onshore directional drilling services. We offer a complete package of premium drilling services, including directional drilling, horizontal drilling, underbalanced drilling, MWD, rental tools and pipe inspection services. Our equipment package also includes various technologies, including our positive pulse MWD navigational tool asset fleet, mud motors and ancillary downhole tools, as well as third-party electromagnetic navigational systems. These technologies, coupled with our services and experienced and specialized personnel, allow our customers to drill wellbores to specific target zones within narrow location parameters. Our personnel are involved in all aspects of a well, from the initial planning of a customers drilling program to the management and execution of the horizontal or directional drilling operations. Our directional drilling team will remain on location 24 hours per day and oversee all drilling operations, both of the vertical and lateral wellbore, until completion. In addition, our remote monitoring capabilities allow our supervisory personnel to continuously monitor the progress of each directional drilling job across multiple drilling locations. Our directional drilling services are supported by our 30,000 square foot facility in Willis, Texas that allows us to manufacture downhole motors and perform a majority of our machining, repair and testing of our directional drilling equipment in-house. We believe our vertically integrated operations, from our in-house manufacturing and repair facilities to trucking and logistics capabilities, provide operational flexibility valued by our customers and represent a competitive advantage. 
 We provide directional drilling services to E&P companies in many of the most active areas of onshore oil and natural gas development in the United States, including the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-Continent region (including the SCOOP/STACK), Marcellus/Utica Shale and DJ/Powder River Basin. 
 We also provide a suite of integrated and related services, including downhole rental tools and third-party inspection services of drill pipe and downhole tools. The demand for these services is primarily influenced by customer drilling-related activity levels. We introduced these tool rental and inspection services in 2008 in response to customer demand and increasing third-party costs relating to tool inspections. Our tool rental and inspection business is complementary to the other services we offer and provides us with opportunities to offer our other services in addressing the drilling needs of our customers. 
 Pressure Pumping Services 
 We are a leading provider of pressure pumping services in the Mid-Continent region, primarily in our capacity as a provider of hydraulic fracturing services to E&P companies. Pressure pumping services are intended to optimize hydrocarbon flow paths during the completion phase of horizontal wells. We focus on providing services for larger frac jobs, but have the capability to provide a customized range of frac services to meet the particular needs of our customers. We believe our technical capabilities, depth of talent and operational flexibility allow us to accommodate the increasing requirements of our customers frac jobs and such strengths provide us with access to a large number of customers. In addition, many of these jobs require logistically intensive service and mobility capabilities for which we are well suited as a result of our basin-specific experience. We believe such operational flexibility allows us to be responsive to our customers needs, increasing the utilization of our assets and strengthening our existing customer relationships. For example, our strong operational performance is demonstrated by an exclusive contract for our third unconventional frac spread with a leading independent operator for approximately 12 months of dedicated work in the Mid-Continent region that commenced in October 2017. In addition, in January 2018, we placed initial orders for twelve incremental frac pumps and ancillary equipment to redeploy our fourth frac spread. The fourth frac spread will consist of new equipment as well as refurbished and ancillary equipment from our existing inventory.

As of December 31, 2017, our pressure pumping fleet had a capacity of 245,925 HHP, of which 218,900 HHP was dedicated to hydraulic fracturing, 14,525 HHP was dedicated to cementing and 12,500 HHP was dedicated to acidizing. As of December 31, 2017, we had 206,925 total deployed HHP, 179,900 of which was deployed to hydraulic fracturing. Of our total deployed HHP dedicated to hydraulic fracturing, approximately 93% is dedicated to unconventional hydraulic fracturing services in the Mid-Continent, approximately 5% is dedicated to hydraulic fracturing services in the Rockies, and approximately 2% is dedicated to vertical fracturing services. We have successfully grown our pressure pumping services business segment through organic growth and acquisitions. From January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2017, we have increased our total fleet from 15,450 HHP to 245,925 HHP, and in January 2018 we placed initial orders for twelve incremental pumps and ancillary equipment to redeploy our fourth pressure pumping fleet. Additionally, in early September 2017, we entered into a contract to reactivate our third unconventional frac spread in the Mid-Continent region and operations commenced in October 2017. 
 We have historically focused our operations in this business segment in the Mid-Continent region (including the SCOOP/STACK) and Rocky Mountain region (including the Williston Basin), with an additional presence in the Permian Basin, and believe that we are well-positioned in these regions given demand for our services continues to improve. 
 We believe our high-quality active pressure pumping assets, with the majority of our pressure pumping equipment built within the last five years, allows us to provide reliable services to our customers. Our pressure pumping fleet operates out of two facilities in Oklahoma, a 41,475 square foot facility in Ponca City and a 43,510 square foot facility in Union City. Through our Oklahoma City pressure control facility, we have the in-house ability to retrofit and perform maintenance on our frac pumps and blenders, allowing us to better preserve our pressure pumping equipment at a lower cost versus outsourcing to third parties. In addition, we have multi-year proppant supply contracts for approximately 167,000 average annual tons through 2020. We also have 13,250 tons of flat sand storage in Enid, Oklahoma in our facility located on the BNSF Railway, which provides access to the materials needed to ensure consistently reliable operations. 
 We also provide cementing services, including surface- and intermediate-casing and long-string cementing capabilities, as well as a full range of acid stimulation services, including CO2 foamed acid stimulation, in all of the basins in which our pressure pumping services operate. 
 Our personnel have extensive technical expertise and customer relationships, which we believe enables us to maintain and further expand our presence in these regions. Additionally, we believe these regions will continue to benefit from E&P companies increasing design of more complex wells, with higher service intensity that increases demand for our services. 
 Pressure Control Services 
 Our pressure control services business segment consists of coiled tubing, rig-assisted snubbing, nitrogen, fluid pumping and well control services. These services provide essential support for drilling, completion and workover activities in unconventional resource plays. Our pressure control services have the ability to operate under high pressure without delay or production halts for a well that is under pressure. Ceasing or suppressing production during the completion phase of an unconventional well could result in formation damage impacting the overall recovery of reserves and ultimately resulting in reduced returns for our E&P customers. Our pressure control services help E&P companies minimize the risk of such damage during completion activities. As of December 31, 2017, we provided our pressure control services through our fleet of 23 coiled tubing units (greater than 82% of which have two-inch or larger diameter coil, allowing us to service extended reach laterals), 36 rig-assisted snubbing units and 24 nitrogen pumping units. We have an additional large-diameter capacity unit on order, with delivery expected in the second quarter of 2018, and are anticipating adding an additional large-diameter capacity unit later in 2018. We provide our pressure control services in the Mid-Continent region (including the SCOOP/STACK), Eagle Ford Shale, Permian Basin, Marcellus/Utica Shale, DJ/Powder River Basin, Haynesville Shale, Fayetteville Shale and Williston Basin (including the Bakken Shale).

Our coiled tubing units are used in the provision of well-servicing and workover applications, or in support of unconventional completions. Our rig-assisted snubbing units are used in conjunction with a workover rig to insert or remove downhole tools or in support of other well services while maintaining pressure in the well, or in support of unconventional completions. Our nitrogen pumping units provide a non-combustible environment downhole and are used in support of other pressure control or well-servicing applications. Our fluid pumping units are used primarily in the support of our coiled tubing intervention activities. 
 We also offer highly-technical and specialized well control services, which are typically required in response to emergencies at the well, particularly fires and blowouts. Our team is comprised of oilfield services veterans with extensive domestic and international experience in well control operations dating back to the 1980s. 
 We have in-house manufacturing and repair capabilities through our 120,000 square foot facility in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma that differentiates us and provides us with the ability to create customized solutions and make efficient repairs. These capabilities provide us the flexibility to customize coiled tubing and rig-assisted snubbing equipment, which has led to improved safety designs, decreased rig-up time and overall efficiency. 
 Wireline Services 
 Our wireline services business segment principally provides plug-and-perf services to enable hydraulic fracturing of new and existing wells. We increase efficiencies for customers by reducing downtime between each hydraulic fracturing process, which leads to more completed stages per day and fewer days required to complete each well. The industry-preferred plug-and-perf method leads to better productivity of Shale wells over other methods. Additionally, we provide logging services, including industrial logging services, for cavern, storage and injection wells, and have exclusive leases to operate Archers POINT® proprietary detection system and the SPACE® imaging and measurement platform in the U.S. land market. The POINT® system includes seven powerful diagnostic programs that enable a proactive and systematic approach to managing well integrity. The SPACE® imaging and measurement platform utilizes ground breaking ultrasonic techniques to enable true spatial understanding of the downhole environment. A multi-element transducer, operated as a phased array, and advanced signal and image processing algorithms combine to produce high resolution 2D and 3D rendered images. Production logging, casing evaluation, perforating, mechanical services and pipe recovery round out our offering. 
 We established our wireline services business segment in 2014 to enter the horizontal plug-and-perf market which was highly complementary to our pressure pumping services. We hired experienced management personnel and ordered new, custom built, cased-hole wireline trucks and equipment. In December 2015, the acquisition of the U.S. pressure pumping, directional drilling, wireline and pressure control services businesses (the Archer Acquisition) from Archer Well Company Inc. (Archer) significantly expanded our fleet and brought additional service offerings. 
 As of December 31, 2017, we operated 49 wireline units, 21 of which are suited for unconventional activity, and operated from eight facilities throughout the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-Continent, South Texas and Gulf Coast regions. Of the 21 wireline units suited for unconventional activity, 8 units are available to deploy as conditions warrant. We offer our wireline services in all markets in which we provide pressure pumping services. From January 2016 to December 2017, we have completed approximately 14,900 stages in the United States with a run efficiency of approximately 98.5%. 
 For disclosures regarding segment financial information, see Part II, Item 8, Note 14 of this Annual Report. 
 Geographic Areas of Operation 
 Our directional drilling services business segment operates in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-Continent region (including the SCOOP/STACK), Marcellus/Utica Shale and DJ/Powder River Basin. Our pressure pumping services business segment has historically operated in the Mid-Continent region (including the SCOOP/STACK) where we have a leading market position, as well as the Rocky Mountain region (including the Williston Basin) and the Permian Basin. Our pressure control services business segment operates in the Mid-Continent region (including the SCOOP/STACK), Eagle Ford Shale, Permian Basin, Marcellus/Utica Shale, DJ/Powder River Basin, Haynesville Shale, Fayetteville Shale and Williston Basin (including the Bakken Shale), providing access

 across the continental United States. Lastly, our wireline services business segment provides services throughout the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale and Mid-Continent region (including the SCOOP/STACK), Haynesville Shale and the DJ/Powder River Basin. These expansive operating areas provide us with access to a number of nearby unconventional crude oil and natural gas basins, both with existing customers expanding their production footprint and third parties acquiring new acreage. Our proximity to existing and prospective customer activities allows us to anticipate or respond quickly to such customers needs and efficiently deploy our assets. 
 We believe that our strategic geographic positioning will benefit us as activity increases in our core operating areas. Our broad geographic footprint provides us with exposure to the ongoing recovery in drilling and completion activity and will allow us to opportunistically pursue new business in basins with the most active drilling environments. 
 Seasonality 
 Our operations are located in different regions of the United States. Some of these areas are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions, primarily in the winter and spring. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, we may be unable to move our equipment between locations, thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenues. The exploration activities of our customers may also be affected during such periods of adverse weather conditions. Weather conditions also affect the demand for, and prices of, oil and natural gas and, as a result, demand for our services. 
Marketing and Customers 
 We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our competition includes many large and small oilfield service companies. As such, we price our services and products to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate, adjusting our rates to reflect current market conditions as necessary. We examine the rate of utilization of our equipment as a measure of our ability to compete in the current market environment. 
 We have also established over time a diverse and balanced mix of customers, including large, midsize and small oil and natural gas E&P companies. We served approximately 800 customers in 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, EOG Resources accounted for approximately 10.3% of the Companys consolidated revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, no customer individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. If we were to lose any material customer, we believe that in the current market environment we would be able to redeploy our equipment with limited downtime. However, the loss of a material customer could have an adverse effect on our business until the equipment is redeployed at similar utilization and pricing levels. 
 Competition 
 The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. To be successful, a company must provide services and products that meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas E&P companies and drilling services contractors at competitive prices. We provide our services and products across the United States and we compete against different companies in each service and product line we offer. Our competition includes many large and small oilfield service companies, including some of the largest integrated oilfield services companies. 
 Our major competitors in directional drilling include Sperry Drilling Services Inc., Baker Hughes, Scientific Drilling International, Inc., Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., LEAM Drilling Systems, LLC and Nabors Industries Ltd. Our major competitors for pressure pumping include Halliburton Company, FTS International, Inc., C&J Energy Services, Inc., Keane Group, Inc., Basic Energy Services, Inc. and RPC, Inc. Our major competitors in our pressure control business services segment include Halliburton Company, C&J Energy Services, Inc., Red Zone Coil Tubing LLC, Nine Energy Service, Inc. and RPC, Inc. Our major competitors in wireline services include Baker Hughes, C&J Energy Services, Inc., Nine Energy Service, Inc. and Allied-Horizontal Wireline Services, LLC. 
 We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are quality of service and products, reputation for safety and technical proficiency, availability and price. While we must be competitive in our pricing, we believe our customers select our services and products based on the local leadership and basin-expertise that our field management and operating personnel use to deliver quality services and products.

Suppliers 
 We have dedicated supply chain teams that manage sourcing and logistics to ensure flexibility and continuity of our supply chain in a cost effective manner across our geographic areas of operation. We have fostered long-term relationships with numerous industry leading suppliers of proppant, chemicals, coil tubing and select directional drilling, pressure pumping, pressure control and wireline equipment. In addition, we have multi-year proppant supply contracts for approximately 167,000 average annual tons through 2020. 
 We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are manufactured and supplied for our operations. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials. To date, we have generally been able to obtain the equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our operations on a timely basis. While we believe that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these materials and/or products by one of our suppliers, we may not always be able to do so. In addition, certain materials for which we do not currently have long-term supply agreements could experience shortages and significant price increases in the future. As a result, we may be unable to mitigate any future supply shortages and our results of operations, prospects and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 Intellectual Property 
 In connection with our wireline services business segment, we have exclusive leases to operate Archers POINT® proprietary detection system and the SPACE® imaging and measurement platform in the U.S. land market. The agreements that govern our operation of the POINT® and SPACE® technology prohibit Archer from providing such technology to any third parties for use in the U.S. land market during the term of such agreements. The POINT® system includes diagnostic programs that enable a systematic approach to managing well integrity. The SPACE® imaging and measurement platform utilizes ultrasonic techniques to enable spatial understanding of the downhole environment. A multi-element transducer, operated as a phased array, and advanced signal and image processing algorithms combine to produce high resolution 2D and 3D rendered images. 
 We have pending applications and registered trademarks for various names under which our entities conduct business or provide products or services. Except for the foregoing, we do not own or license any patents, trademarks or other intellectual property that we believe to be material to the success of our business. In addition, we rely to a great extent on the technical expertise and know-how of our personnel to maintain our competitive position, and we take commercially reasonable measures to protect trade secrets and other confidential and/or proprietary information relating to the technologies we develop. 
Risk Management and Insurance 
 Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oilfield services industry, such as accidents, blowouts, explosions, fires and spills and releases that can cause: 
 

 | personal injury or loss of life;
--+---------------------------------


 | damage or destruction of property, equipment, natural resources and the environment; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | suspension of operations.
--+--------------------------

 In addition, claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the oilfield services industry. If a serious accident were to occur at a location where our equipment and services are being used, it could result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims. 
 Because our business involves the transportation of heavy equipment and materials, we may also experience traffic accidents which may result in spills, property damage and personal injury. 
 Despite our efforts to maintain safety standards, we from time to time have suffered accidents in the past and anticipate that we could experience accidents in the future. In addition to the property damage, personal injury and other losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability and our relationships with customers, employees, regulatory agencies and other parties. Any significant 
 
10 
 
 increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of compensation awards, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers compensation and other forms of insurance, and could have other material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Although we maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs relative to perceived risk. Further, insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1,324 full time employees and overall personnel count increased approximately 33.7% from the year ended December 31, 2016. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements. We also hire independent contractors and consultants involved in land, technical, regulatory and other disciplines to assist our full time employees. 
Safety and Remediation Program 
 In the oilfield services industry, an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long term oil and natural gas E&P customer relationships is having an experienced and skilled workforce. Recently, many of our large customers have placed an emphasis not only on pricing, but also on safety records and quality management systems of contractors. We believe these factors will gain further importance in the future. We have dedicated safety personnel and training facilities for each of our four business segments. We have committed resources toward employee safety and quality management training programs. Our field employees are required to complete both technical and safety training programs. Further, as part of our safety program and remediation procedures, we check fluid lines for any defects on a periodic basis to avoid line failure during hydraulic fracturing operations, marking such fluid lines to reflect the most recent testing date. We also regularly monitor pressure levels in the fluid lines used for fracturing and the surface casing to verify that the pressure and flow rates are consistent with the job specific model in an effort to avoid failure. As part of our safety procedures, we also have the capability to shut down our pressure pumping and fracturing operations both at the lines and in our data van. In addition, we maintain spill kits on location for containment of pollutants that may be spilled in the process of providing our hydraulic fracturing services. The spill kits are generally comprised of pads and booms for absorption and containment of spills, as well as soda ash for neutralizing acid. Fire extinguishers are also in place on job sites at each pump. 
 As warranted, we have used a third-party contractor to provide remediation and spill response services when necessary to address spills that were beyond our containment capabilities. None of these prior spills were significant, and we have not experienced any significant incidents, citations or legal proceeding relating to our hydraulic fracturing services for environmental concerns. To the extent our hydraulic fracturing or other oilfield services operations result in a future spill, leak or other environmental impact that is beyond our ability to contain, we intend to engage the services of such remediation company or an alternative company, as required, to assist us with clean-up and remediation. 
 Government Regulations and Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
 We operate under the jurisdiction of a number of regulatory bodies that regulate worker safety standards, the handling of hazardous materials, the storage and transportation of explosives, the protection of human health and the environment and standards of operation. Regulations concerning equipment certification create an ongoing need for regular maintenance which is incorporated into our daily operating procedures. Moreover, the oil and natural gas industry is subject to environmental regulation pursuant to local, state and federal legislation and regulatory initiatives. 
Transportation Matters 
 In connection with our transportation and relocation of our oilfield service equipment and shipment of frac sand, we operate trucks and other heavy equipment. As such, we operate as a commercial motor carrier in providing certain of our services and therefore are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and analogous state agencies. These regulatory 
 
11 
 
 authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety, driver licensing and insurance requirements, financial reporting and review of certain mergers, consolidations and acquisitions and hazardous materials labeling, placarding and marking. There are additional regulations specifically related to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. In addition, our trucking operations are subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may increase our costs by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period, onboard electronic logging device (ELD) requirements or limits on vehicle weight and size. 
 Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the DOT. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations but may be more stringent. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. 
 Finally, from time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of contracted drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us would be enacted. 
 Environmental Matters and Regulation 
 General. Our operations and the operations of our oil and natural gas E&P customers are subject to stringent federal, tribal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before conducting regulated activities, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that may be released into the environment, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically sensitive and other protected areas, require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or relating to our owned or operated facilities. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of delays in the permitting or performance of projects; and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations in a particular area. 
 The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may adversely affect the environment, and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations or reinterpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly completion activities, or waste handling, storage transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Additionally, our customers may also incur increased costs or delays or restrictions in permitting or operating activities as a result of more stringent environmental laws and regulations, which may result in a curtailment of exploration, development or production activities that would reduce the demand for our services. 
 The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental laws, as amended from time to time, to which our business is subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position. 
 
12 
 
Waste Handling. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal and clean-up of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. Pursuant to rules issued by the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. In the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. Additionally, drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRAs less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in response to a lawsuit filed by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agencys failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and natural gas wastes, the EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a Consent Decree issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on December 28, 2016. Under the decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and natural gas waste regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our, as well as the oil and natural gas E&P industrys, costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on the industry as well as on our business. 
 Remediation of Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state statutes impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We currently own, lease or operate upon numerous properties and facilities that for many years have been used for industrial activities, including oil and natural gas-related operations. Hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned, leased or operated upon by us, or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners whose treatment and disposal or release of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons, was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes and remediate contaminated property (including groundwater contamination), including instances where the prior owner or operator caused the contamination, or perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination. 
 Handling and Exposure to Radioactive Materials. In the course of our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) associated with oil and natural gas deposits and, accordingly may result in the generation of wastes and other materials containing NORM. Any NORM exhibiting levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. Because certain of the properties presently or previously owned, operated or occupied by us may have been used for oil and natural gas production operations, it is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with NORM. 
 In addition, some of our operations utilize equipment that contains sealed, low-grade radioactive sources. Our activities involving the use of radioactive materials are regulated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and also by state regulatory agencies under agreement with the NRC. Standards implemented by these regulatory agencies require us to obtain licenses or other approvals for the use of such radioactive materials. These regulatory agencies have adopted regulations implementing and enforcing these laws, for which compliance is often costly and difficult.

Water Discharges and Discharges into Belowground Formations. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the Clean Water Act) and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and hazardous substances, into state waters and waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements imposed under the Clean Water Act require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws also may impose substantial civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance including spills and other non-authorized discharges. In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) published a final rule outlining their position on the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States, including wetlands, but legal challenges to this rule followed, and the rule was stayed nationwide by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in October 2015, pending resolution of the court challenges. In January 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court accepted review of the rule to determine whether jurisdiction rested with the federal district or appellate courts and, in a decision issued on January 22, 2018, held that legal challenges of the rule must be heard at the district rather than appellate court level. Additionally, following the issuance of a presidential executive order to review the rule, the EPA and Corps proposed a rule in June 2017 to repeal the 2015 rule. The EPA and Corps also announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the Clean Water Acts jurisdiction. On February 6, 2018, the EPA and Corps published a final rule specifying that the contested June 2015 rule would not take effect until February 6, 2020. As a result, future implementation of the June 2015 rule is uncertain at this time. Any expansion of the Clean Water Acts jurisdiction in areas where we or our oil and natural gas E&P customers operate could impose additional permitting obligations on us and our customers. 
 The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) amends the Clean Water Act and sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills. The OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities and onshore facilities, including E&P facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under OPA, responsible parties including owners and operators of onshore facilities may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. The OPA also requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare Facility Response Plans for responding to a worst case discharge of oil into waters of the United States. 
 Our customers dispose of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids gathered from oil and natural gas producing operations in accordance with permits issued by government authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern relates to recent seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids resulting from oil and natural gas activities. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. Developing research suggests that the link between seismic activity and wastewater disposal may vary by region, and that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or may have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity. In March 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico and Arkansas. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Texas and Oklahoma have issued rules for wastewater disposal wells that imposed certain permitting restrictions, operating restrictions and/or reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults. States may, from time to time, develop and implement plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations, as has occurred in Oklahoma. More recently, in December 2016, the Oklahoma Corporation Commissions (OCC) Oil and Gas Conservation Division and the Oklahoma Geological Survey released well completion seismicity guidance, which requires operators to take certain prescriptive actions, including an operators planned mitigation practices, following certain unusual seismic activity within 1.25 miles of hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition, in February 2017, the OCCs Oil and Gas Conservation Division issued an order limiting future increases in the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater injected belowground into the Arbuckle formation in an effort to reduce the number of earthquakes in the state, and imposed further restrictions in the Edmonds area of the state in August 2017. Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal.

These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by our customers to dispose of flowback and produced water and certain other oilfield fluids. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity also could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for waste disposal. Any one or more of these developments may result in our customers having to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates or locations, or require our customers or third party disposal well operators that are used to dispose of customer wastewater to shut down disposal wells, which developments could adversely affect our customers business and result in a corresponding decrease in the need for our services, which would could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Air Emissions. Some of our operations also result in emissions of regulated air pollutants. The federal Clean Air Act (the CAA) and analogous state laws require permits for certain facilities that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere that could adversely affect environmental quality. These laws and their implementing regulations also impose generally applicable limitations on air emissions and require adherence to maintenance, work practice, reporting and record keeping, and other requirements. Failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit or other regulatory requirements could result in the imposition of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties. In addition, we or our oil and natural gas E&P customers could be required to shut down or retrofit existing equipment, leading to additional expenses and operational delays. 
 Many of these regulatory requirements, including new source performance standards (NSPS) and Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards are expected to be made more stringent over time as a result of stricter ambient air quality standards and other air quality protection goals adopted by the EPA. Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact on our business. For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQs), for ground-level ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the eight-hour primary and secondary standards. The EPA published a final rule in November 2017 that issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone for approximately 85% of the U.S. counties as either attainment/unclassifiable or unclassifiable and is expected to issue attainment or non-attainment designations for the remaining areas of the United States not addressed in the November 2017 final rule in the first half of 2018. States are also expected to implement requirements as a result of this NAAQs final rule, which could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase costs for us and our customers. Moreover, our business could be materially affected if our customers operations are significantly affected by these or other similar requirements. These requirements could increase the cost of doing business for us and our customers and reduce the demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce, and thus have an adverse effect on the demand for our services. 
 Climate Change. The U.S. Congress and the EPA, in addition to some state and regional efforts, have in recent years considered legislation or regulations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. In the absence of federal GHG-limiting legislations, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations that, among other things, restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA and may require the installation of best available control technology to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that we may seek to construct in the future if they would otherwise emit large volumes of GHGs together with other criteria pollutants. Also, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission and storage facilities in the United States on an annual basis. In October 2015, the EPA amended and expanded the GHG reporting requirements to all segments of the oil and natural gas industry, including gathering and boosting stations as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells.

The EPA has also taken steps to limit methane emissions, a GHG, from certain new modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector through the adoption of a final rule in June 2016 establishing Subpart OOOOa standards for methane emissions. However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of these Subpart OOOOa standards for two years and reconsider the entirety of the 2016 standards but the agency has not yet published a final rule and, as a result, the 2016 standards are currently in effect but future implementation of the 2016 standards is uncertain at this time. Furthermore, in November 2016, the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) published a final rule that established, among other things, requirements to reduce methane emissions arising from venting, flaring and leaks from oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Native American lands. However, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule to temporarily suspend or delay certain requirements contained in the November 2016 final rule until January 17, 2019, including those requirements relating to the venting, flaring and leakage from oil and natural gas production activities. The suspension of the November 2016 final rule is being challenged in court. Given the long-term trend towards increasing regulation, future federal GHG regulations of the oil and natural gas industry remain a possibility, and should the EPAs June 2016 or the BLMs November 2016 rules remain in effect, or any other new methane emission standards be imposed on the oil and natural gas sector, such requirements could result in increased costs to our or our oil and natural gas E&P customers operations as well as result in delays or curtailment in such operations, which costs, delays or curtailment could adversely affect our business. 
 In December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that prepared an agreement requiring member countries to review and represent a progression in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. This Paris Agreement was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered in force in November 2016; however, this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, but rather includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. In August 2017, the U.S. State Department informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. Substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas our E&P customers produce and lower the value of their reserves, which developments could reduce demand for our services and have a corresponding material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Moreover, recent activism directed at shifting investments away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. 
 Finally, it should be noted that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earths atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations. 
 Endangered Species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) and analogous state laws regulate activities that could have an adverse effect on threatened and endangered species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or oil and gas development. If harm to species or damages to habitat occur, government entities or, at times, private parties may act to prevent oil and gas exploration or development activities or seek damages for harm to species, habitat or natural resources resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and, in some cases, may seek criminal penalties. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect these species or their habitat could delay, restrict or prohibit drilling in certain areas by our oil and natural gas E&P customers, which could reduce demand for our services. 
 In addition, as a result of one or more settlements entered into by the FWS, the agency is required to consider listing numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA pursuant to specific time lines. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where our oil and natural gas customers operate could cause certain of our customers to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on their E&P activities that could have an adverse effect on our ability to provide products and services to those customers.

Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing 
 We perform hydraulic fracturing services for our oil and natural gas E&P customers. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and chemical additives under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. 
 Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar agencies, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel and issued permitting guidance that applies to such activities. Additionally, the EPA issued final CAA regulations in 2012 and in June 2016 governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released during hydraulic fracturing; published in June 2016 an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants; and published in May 2014 an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the BLM finalized rules in March 2015 that imposed new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Native American lands. In June 2016, a Wyoming federal judge struck down this final rule, finding that the BLM lacked authority to promulgate the rule. The BLM appealed the decision to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in 2016. The appellate court issued a ruling in September 2017 to vacate the Wyoming trial court decision and dismiss the lawsuit challenging the 2015 rule in response to the BLMs issuance of a proposed rulemaking to rescind the 2015 rule and, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule rescinding the March 2015 rule. In January 2018, litigation challenging the BLMs rescission of the 2015 rule was brought in federal court. 
 Also, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that water cycle activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. 
 In addition, various state and local governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements, well construction and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas. For example, Texas, Colorado and North Dakota, among others, have adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. States could also elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. If new federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly to perform hydraulic fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could result in decreased oil and natural gas E&P activities and, therefore, adversely affect demand for our services and our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and doing business. 
 Historically, our hydraulic fracturing compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future. It is possible, however, that substantial costs for compliance or penalties for non-compliance may be incurred in the future. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws, regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently quantify. 
 Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry 
 The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by 
 
17 
 
 statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although changes to the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry could affect the demand for our services, we would not expect to be affected any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the industry with similar operations. 
 Drilling. Our customers operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local level. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The state and some counties and municipalities in which our customers are located also regulate one or more of the following: 

 | the location of wells;
--+-----------------------


 | the method of drilling and casing wells;
--+-----------------------------------------


 | the timing of construction or drilling activities, including seasonal wildlife closures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | notice to, and consultation with, surface owners and other third parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 State Regulation. States regulate the drilling for oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The oil and natural gas industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us. To the extent that such regulations result in the curtailment of our customers operations or production, we may incur decreased demand for our services, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
Storage and Handling of Explosive Materials. 
 Our operations involve the handling of explosive materials for our wireline services provided to our oil and natural gas E&P customers. Despite our use of specialized facilities to store explosive materials and intensive employee training programs, the handling of explosive materials could result in incidents that temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt our or our customers operations or could cause delays in the delivery of our services. It is possible that an explosion could result in death or significant injuries to employees and other persons. Material property damage to us, our customers and other third parties could also occur. Any explosive incident could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages, including environmental natural resource damages, or cause production delays, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 OSHA Matters 
 We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. Such requirements may include general industry standards, recordkeeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. Historically, our worker health and safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future.
