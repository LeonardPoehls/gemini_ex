 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
  
 (A) BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
  
 Kyto Biopharma, Inc. was originally formed under the name of B. Twelve, Inc., a Florida corporation, filed with the Department of State on March 5, 1999.
  
 On April 27, 1999, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation, increasing its authorized capital stock from 1,000 shares of common stock with a Par Value of $1.00 per share, to 25,000,000 shares of common stock with a Par Value of $1.00 per share and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, also with a Par Value of $1.00 per share.
  
 In August, 2001, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation, changing the Par Value of its common stock from $1.00 per share to $0.0001 Par Value per share.
  
 On August 14, 2002, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation, changing the name to KYTO BIOPHARMA, INC.
  
 The Company filed a Uniform Business Report (UBR) with the Department of State, State of Florida, for the year 2008 and paid all required fees. Its status is active.
  
 The Company is currently not in the development stage and was in “development stage” till June 30, 2011.
  
 On September 24, 2015 a submission on Florida Section 607.0704 of the Florida Business Corporation Act was sent to the Company. Pursuant to this Section it is possible for shareholders owning a majority of the outstanding stock of the Company to take an action without the requirement of a meeting.
 
 The action taken by the majority shareholders was taken for the purpose of increasing the share price which could generate interest in the Company by investors and provide business opportunities. The action then adopted a reverse stock split in the amount of a one (1) for ten (10) of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. By way of explanation, a reverse stock split is a process whereby a company decreases the number of company shares that are available and increases the price per share by combining the current shares into fewer shares. The reverse split does not change the number of authorized shares of common stock. Each stockholder will hold the same percentage of our outstanding common stock immediately following the reverse stock split as she or he did immediately prior to the reverse stock split, except for adjustments required to the treatment of fractional shares.
 
 It should be pointed out that the Company sees no dissenters’ rights with respect to the reverse stock split, and we do not intend to independently provide shareholders with such rights.
 
 As a result of the reverse stock split, every 10 shares of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock. Unless otherwise noted, impacted amounts and share information included in the financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted for the stock split as if such stock split occurred on the first day of the first period presented.
