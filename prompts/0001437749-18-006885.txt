OUR TARGET VERTICAL MARKETS
 
We focus our efforts on delivering mission-critical software solutions to enterprise customers in six core vertical markets within global manufacturing – automotive, life sciences, consumer products, food and beverage, high technology and industrial products. Within these vertical markets, we focus on 26 segments where our customers can receive the greatest benefit from our solutions. Segment examples include automotive tier suppliers, orthopedic medical device manufacturers, pharmaceutical contract manufacturers, flexible packaging producers as well as manufacturers of consumer electronics. We offer solutions designed to overcome the business challenges within each segment, based on our in-depth knowledge of the segment and best practices. In addition, we participate in industry groups serving our target segments to ensure that we address regulatory compliance issues, evaluate new manufacturing practices and leverage advanced technologies to give our customers maximum competitive advantage.
Automotive: Automotive suppliers are a key focus for QAD.  Automotive suppliers must meet critical industry standards such as the Materials Management Operations Guideline/Logistics Evaluation (“MMOG/LE”) and International Automotive Task Force (“IATF”) 16949:2016 (previously ISO/TS 16949). Disruptions to the supply chain can cause significant financial impact. QAD’s automotive-specific processes and built-in industry best practices help automotive suppliers reduce costs, mitigate supply chain risk and improve supply chain planning and visibility. Our customer base includes companies serving the global automotive marketplace, especially the tier-1 suppliers in the supply chains of automotive original equipment manufacturers. We deliver unique capabilities to support the collaboration requirements of the automotive suppliers, including the strict quality requirements of Advanced Product Quality Process (“APQP”) and Production Part Approval Process (“PPAP”). Many of our customers use QAD Cloud EDI because it provides a scalable solution which standardizes Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”) across their global enterprise. QAD Supplier Portal, which allows for electronic communication with other suppliers, is another product commonly used by our automotive customers. QAD solutions are in use at many of the market-leading automotive parts companies throughout the world that manufacture a broad range of components used in interiors, electrical components, safety systems, bodies and drivetrains.

Life Sciences: Life sciences manufacturers are dedicated to innovation, product quality and patient safety; however, a tightening regulatory environment, increasing cost pressures and greater supply chain complexities present challenges to the industry. Emerging markets, quality initiatives, and mergers and acquisitions activity also add to the complexity of life sciences manufacturing and distribution. QAD focuses on the following five segments in the life sciences industry: contract manufacturing; surgical devices; orthopedic devices; diagnostic devices; and pharmaceutical/biotechnology manufacturers. QAD solutions help global life sciences companies manufacture products in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations and standards like ISO13485:2016 that are embraced by regulators around the world. In addition to cGMP, QAD solutions support many business and regulatory processes specific to the life sciences industry, such as automated quality management, supply chain planning and serialization in support of requirements for Unique Device Identification (“UDI”), the Drug Quality and Security Act (“DQSA”) and the Falsified Medicines Directive (“FMD”). Our customers’ products include such items as defibrillators, ventricular assist systems, artificial joints, prescription medications, surgical instruments and packaging for the life sciences industry. QAD’s enterprise applications for life sciences provides our customers with a qualified IT infrastructure as a key building block to help them ensure that they have a solid foundation upon which to base their software validation requirements.
Consumer Products: Manufacturers of consumer products have the objective of delivering the right product, in the right quantities, to the right location at the right time to satisfy demand. To meet this goal, effective supply chain management is needed to synchronize critical activities and functions across the organization.  To gain market share and improve profitability, consumer products companies must anticipate and meet customer demand while managing their margins and complying with evolving safety and environmental regulations. QAD focuses on the following four segments in the consumer products industry: household and personal packaged products; consumer electronics; assembled and discrete products; and jewelry manufacturing. The manufacturing processes for these items vary and depend on the nature of the item; however, the fulfillment and distribution requirements have significant commonality. Major retailers manage complex supply chains and are typically very demanding of their suppliers as they strive to service growing demand from consumers for speed of delivery and variety of products. QAD solutions address the complex replenishment requirements of companies supplying the retail supply chain, including promotional pricing, demand planning, quality compliance and product configuration.
Food and Beverage: Food and beverage manufacturing is complex and requires regular updates to product, packaging and pricing. There is a lack of uniformity in the supply chain, which challenges food and beverage manufacturers to excel at supply chain management, as seasonal demand changes cause inefficiencies and increase manufacturing costs. At the same time, manufacturers must comply with requirements like field to fork traceability and record keeping. QAD focuses on the following six segments in the food and beverage industry: shelf-stable bottling, canning and packaging; distilleries, wineries and brewing; frozen foods; creameries and fresh foods; candy and confections; and meat and fish processing. Our solutions support regulatory and quality initiatives, such as the U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”) and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (“HACCP”) analysis, which address the management of biological, chemical and physical hazards. Our solutions support the product cycle of the food and beverage industry from raw material production, procurement and handling to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the finished product. QAD’s software is standards-focused to help companies ensure food safety and meet the regulatory requirements in the global markets where our customers operate. QAD provides solutions for food and beverage companies that manufacture a broad range of products and manage many of the world’s well-known brands.
High Technology: The success of manufacturers in the high tech industry relies on innovation and the ability to manage change. These manufacturers are subject to constant pressure on margins, challenges with cross border shipments, strains on material availability and cost control initiatives.  They require agile and effective global supply chains. All of these challenges need to be met while complying with standards and industry regulations. QAD solutions are used by many high-technology companies that manufacture a diverse range of products. QAD focuses on the following four segments in the high technology industry: standalone devices and test equipment; batteries, power supplies and lighting; cable, wiring and connectors; and tech contract manufacturing. High-tech companies often face the challenges of very complex product structures with a need for traceability of parts and processes throughout their entire supply chain, as well as tight control of engineering changes. Many high-tech companies providing complex systems also face the challenge of managing installation and support of equipment after sale, in addition to managing field engineering resources. A high-technology manufacturer can use QAD’s solutions to configure product based on customers’ preference; manufacture and assemble product according to a customized specification; and schedule, install and support equipment throughout its lifecycle.

Industrial Products: Today’s global customers are demanding more configure-to-order, make-to-order, and assemble-to-order products. As a result, the modern, agile industrial manufacturer must be responsive to demands while managing tight margins, operational challenges and rapid changes to product features. QAD customers manufacture products as diverse as machine tools; specialist ceramic materials used in aerospace and defense; and equipment used in the oil and gas industries. Fluctuating demand leads to significant challenges in managing the internal supply chain, coordinating the extended vendor ecosystem, controlling costs, ensuring quality, tracking production, and optimizing inventory levels. Companies in this broad vertical market have requirements to maintain many manufacturing methodologies, often within the same enterprise. QAD focuses on the following six segments in the industrial products industry: flexible packaging; engineered materials; contract manufacturing; standalone equipment; remanufacturing; and roll stock and wire cable. Our solutions support multiple manufacturing methodologies in parallel, including lean manufacturing. The need for traceability of materials from source through to the finished product is often important to our customers, and QAD’s capabilities in traceability and serialization support this feature. QAD’s solutions are also used to support our customers’ environmental compliance needs.
 
Our focus on these six vertical markets gives us a competitive advantage by providing a solution developed specifically for our target customers, without the complexity and distraction of functionality they don’t want and don’t need. While some vendors provide broader solutions built for many industries, our narrow vertical focus allows our customers to implement our solutions with fewer configurations and customizations than our competitors require, enabling less complex and faster implementations. We leverage our vertical market expertise in research and development to meet specific industry needs: in sales, to understand our customer’s unique requirements; in presales, to demonstrate how these requirements are handled in the software; and in services, to apply best practices in optimization of business processes and implementation of the software. Our options to sell our product in the cloud or as on-premise licenses enable customers operating in multiple locations to choose a deployment option that best meets their unique needs.
 
QAD SOLUTIONS
 
QAD products and services support the business processes of global manufacturing companies in our target industries. We continually monitor emerging business requirements and practices as well as regulatory changes and incorporate them into our product and solutions strategies. Our development focus emphasizes user experience. We strive to deliver solutions that offer comprehensive capabilities while being easier to learn and use. Our goal is to make all capabilities that a particular user needs available with only a few clicks, giving our end users significant gains in efficiency as well as making the user experience more enjoyable.
 
     The Channel Islands program was designed to transform the architecture and user experience of QAD solutions. Channel Islands has two key components: Channel Islands Experience and the QAD Enterprise Platform.
 
The Channel Islands Experience provides access to QAD Enterprise Applications on any device with a modern web browser. It includes a new user interface (“UI”) written in HTML5 and is accessible to the user with any standard browser. The new UI provides seamless access across desktops and mobile devices and has the ability to co-exist with our current .NET UI. 
 
The QAD Enterprise Platform is the architecture behind Channel Islands. The benefits it provides to customers make it the most significant part of the solution. Manufacturers need an Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system that will allow them to easily change their business processes to meet the demands of their changing market. The QAD Enterprise Platform provides five rapid response capabilities: Personalization; Embedded Analytics; Modularization; Extensibility; and New Apps. Most critically, these capabilities include the ability to extend current applications, to connect with external systems through micro services, and to develop entirely new applications on the platform without the need to write or modify code in QAD Enterprise Applications. Extensions and new apps are non-intrusive to the enterprise applications and do not hinder future upgrades. Modularity provides the ability to upgrade the solution by components, rather than upgrading the entire solution at one time. This makes upgrades smaller, faster and easier; helping customers stay on the most current version of our software which reduces the gap between their business needs and what our enterprise applications provide. Modularity allows us to improve the efficiency of our cloud operations using a simplified upgrade process. The architecture eases the adoption of new advanced technologies into the solution.
 
Mobile devices continue to play an ever-increasing role in our day-to-day lives, and our customers are using mobile computing to support their businesses. Channel Islands leverages a responsive HTML5 user interface that displays appropriately across screen sizes. As such, Channel Islands is available on any device with a modern web browser, including tablets and smartphones.  In addition, QAD provides some mobile specific applications purpose-built for the actions users are likely to take on their mobile devices. These include a requisition approval solution, a mobile business intelligence solution, mobile browse capability and mobile application monitoring tools to support system administrators.
 
In support of our focus on business process efficiency, we have integrated the ability to generate business process maps for common business processes into our software using the QAD Process Editor tool. This tool simplifies implementations, maps common business processes and facilitates navigation throughout the entire product suite. Within our suite, we have embedded business process management (“QAD BPM”). QAD BPM allows customers to visualize their business processes; monitor transactional throughput by user, role or stage; and modify those processes to make them more efficient. Using QAD BPM, companies can create business process models, assign task responsibilities, and monitor and re-direct workflow; all of which reduce process execution time, improve visibility of active processes, identify bottlenecks and support process improvement.

QAD developed its solutions to allow simple integration with other systems our customers use within their organizations. For example, we enable seamless integration between QAD Enterprise Applications and common browser applications and spreadsheets. QAD solutions also integrate easily with other web applications and web services. Using our Q-Xtend toolset, customers can connect to different software, even when remote, and they can use industry-standard middleware products such as the IBM MQ™ series or the standard connectors built on the Dell Boomi AtomSphere integration platform. Robust Application Program Interfaces (“APIs”) along with QAD Automation Solutions provide additional capabilities for integration.
 
QAD Enterprise Applications
 
QAD Enterprise Applications is an integrated suite of software applications, which supports the core business processes of global manufacturing companies, and provides specific functionality to support the requirements of our targeted industries and the geographies in which our customers conduct business.

QAD Enterprise Applications has strong capabilities for addressing global complexities in customers’ business models, such as compliance with local accounting practices and legislation, as well as internal reporting on global performance. QAD Enterprise Applications includes full support for multiple currencies, multiple languages and complex corporate structures such as multiple companies or divisions.
 
QAD Enterprise Applications is available in the cloud, on-premise and in a blended model combining both of these deployment alternatives. Blended deployment enables users to transact more easily across business entities with a consistent interface and consistent functionality since our cloud and on-premise technology is compatible. Companies that have chosen the cloud as a strategic direction but who cannot, or do not want to, move all locations at one time, find the blended deployment model allows them to transition to the cloud with less risk. The finance function can view individual business unit results and run consolidations that cross both cloud and on-premise sites seamlessly, while other users can transact and view inventory in multiple locations irrespective of whether any specific business entity is operating in the cloud or on- premise.

Generally, our on-premise customers purchase maintenance when they acquire new licenses and our maintenance retention rate is more than 90%. Our maintenance and other revenue represented 42%, 47% and 48% of our total revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our maintenance revenue is negatively impacted by customers on maintenance converting to our cloud solutions. When maintenance customers convert to the cloud, they no longer contract for maintenance as those support services and unspecified updates are included as a component of the subscription offering. Our cloud revenue represented approximately 20%, 17% and 11% of our total revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and our cloud customer retention rate is also in excess of 90%. We track our retention rate of cloud and maintenance by calculating the annualized revenue of customer sites with contracts up for renewal during the period compared to the annualized revenue associated with the customer sites that have canceled during the period. The percentage of revenue not canceled is our retention rate. Conversions to the cloud are not considered cancellations for purposes of the maintenance retention rate calculation. Additional users and additional modules are not included in the annualized revenue for purposes of this calculation.

In a constantly evolving world, continuous improvement and flexible systems are fundamental requirements for achieving this vision. In support of our vision, we focus on providing complete solutions and expertise that help our customers improve the effectiveness of their business processes. In addition, our software is designed to support global regulatory and business practice requirements that enable our customers to satisfy governmental and industry regulations, while incorporating industry best practices and providing real-time visibility and measurement supporting continuous business process improvement initiatives.
 
We build solutions in 26 specific industry segments across six manufacturing verticals to provide our customers the capabilities and best practices they need to run their enterprises effectively without the complexity and excess cost associated with customizing generalist solutions. We focus on those areas, within the segments we target, where we see potential for increased growth due to manufacturing expansion, cloud adoption or emerging requirements that we can address.
 
Our goal is to enhance our position as a leading provider of cloud-based enterprise applications for global manufacturing companies. The key elements of our strategy, which we believe will support the achievement of our vision and help drive continued growth, are as follows:
 
Grow our cloud business and expand our footprint within existing customers. We provide full-featured vertically-focused cloud solutions and we believe there is substantial opportunity to grow our cloud-based enterprise solutions within our global manufacturing customer base and to acquire new customers in the core vertical markets we serve. Our cloud solutions allow our customers to focus on their customers and products without the distraction of administering their enterprise applications or maintaining their infrastructure. With over 2,000 customers across our core vertical markets and over 300,000 active users of our on-premise and cloud solutions, we have many opportunities to increase cloud revenue across our existing installed base. We believe new manufacturing companies, or companies created through divestiture from a larger entity, that do not have an existing legacy enterprise platform, are more likely to adopt a cloud computing solution when choosing and implementing a new enterprise system to run their business. 
 
Continuous product development and rapid response to change. Many manufacturers are facing increased change in their industries driven by technology that is enabling new disruptive business models. Just as manufacturers are facing changes in the markets they serve, they are also facing changes in the way they manufacture. Our ability to successfully compete depends in part on our continuous product development and rapid introduction of new technologies, features and functionality. Manufacturers are facing a swiftly changing business environment fueled by exponential growth in underlying technologies. Traditional ERP systems were not designed to manage this rate of change in business process. The QAD Enterprise Platform enables a rapid response to change, allowing customers to align their systems to the current optimal business process without the need for intrusive customization that hinders the ability to respond to future changes. Industry 4.0, Internet of Things (“IoT”), Machine Learning (“ML”), Artificial Intelligence (“AI”), Additive Manufacturing (“3D Printing”), Blockchain, Augmented Reality, and Predictive Analytics are all examples of evolving technologies that can impact the markets in which our customers operate. We believe delivering a focused, flexible ERP system will be increasingly attractive to pragmatic manufacturers seeking a long-term fit of their business systems in support of their strategy in changing markets. We are committed to continuous investment in product development to ensure our products have the necessary capabilities to meet the needs of our global customers and enhance our competitive position in the vertical markets we serve.

 Focus on global manufacturing and leverage expertise within key vertical markets. Many manufacturers operate globally, requiring a provider that can tailor solutions to the unique needs of their markets, deliver local and global services resources and support local languages. Solutions must be cost effective and easy to implement and use. Our solutions offer many benefits to customers with global operations, including capabilities that support operations in multiple geographies with a variety of languages and currencies, as well as compliance with complex local regulations and business practices. Our existing global footprint is a key leverage point for meeting these needs by utilizing offices, personnel and partnerships in many countries around the world. We also employ staff with specific knowledge and experience in the industries in which our customers operate. We provide our solutions to 26 segments across six vertical manufacturing markets; and we actively participate in several leading industry associations; and pride ourselves on the deep expertise of our staff. Our industry knowledge continues to deepen through regular interaction with our customers. This collective experience allows QAD to develop solutions with specific capabilities that address our customers’ needs in the industries they serve.
 
Enhance customer experience to deliver continuous value and maximize customer retention. Through award-winning customer engagement, recognized by Consumer Goods Technology Magazine for four straight years, QAD delivers a continuous improvement process to enable continued alignment for the long term between our customers’ business strategy, people, processes, and best practices; and the technology that supports it. We strive to engage with every customer every year, frequently conducting reviews of their business processes and presenting opportunities for improvement. Our deep vertical segment focus and strong, ongoing customer relationships drive continuous development of industry-specific functionality. As a result, we have maintained retention rates in excess of 90% annually.
 
TECHNOLOGY
 
QAD Enterprise Applications was designed to achieve our vision for global manufacturing companies to effectively run their business processes at peak efficiency, in alignment with their strategic goals. We have chosen the best technologies to achieve our vision, focusing on user experience, integration, business services, analytics, databases and deployment flexibility. We embrace ‘openness’ as a core principle of our designs, aiming to allow customers freedom of choice of devices and open connectivity with other systems. The core of QAD Enterprise Applications is built on a services-oriented architecture, which allows QAD Enterprise Applications’ components to communicate with one another through industry-standard messaging techniques like Representation State Transfer services. This allows customers to exploit the full benefit of QAD’s open architecture for their businesses.
 
QAD Enterprise Applications core systems are built upon the QAD Enterprise Platform. The QAD Enterprise Platform is a micro-services architecture with the technologies and development tools needed to build a world class user experience (UX) with comprehensive functionality for global manufacturing companies.  This functionality is encapsulated into Apps that can be upgraded independently of each other as well as extended by customers.  Apps can be accessed securely over the Internet via a web browser or mobile devices (iOS and Android). The platform provides many advanced services to Apps like an App builder, security, integration, cloud support, analytics, mobile, collaboration and a world-class UX.  The platform supports UX, code, data and cloud flexibility to adapt readily to the ever-changing world of technology.  The UX is built using the latest open web technologies to support a rich HTML5 user interface. Business logic can be implemented in JavaScript via the more structured Type Script, Oracle’s Java or Progress Software Corporation’s OpenEdge language. Databases include MySQL and Progress OpenEdge.
 
QAD’s enterprise architecture provides significant flexibility for global companies in deploying QAD Enterprise Applications. Our enterprise architecture allows companies to separate the legal structure of their business from physical operating locations or to separate both of these from the software instances and computer hardware that support them. With QAD enterprise architecture, customers can choose which sites are a part of which companies, which sites are supported on any instance of the application, or which sites operate as one instance. Customers can also choose centralized, decentralized or hybrid computing architectures with parts of their enterprise running from both central resources and local resources.
 
QAD combines our technologies to provide a comprehensive cloud solution for our customers. Our cloud architecture encompasses infrastructure provisioning and application deployment, management, monitoring and security; providing a world-class development operations practice built around Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) standards. QAD’s cloud infrastructure operates on a Cloud Management Platform. This enables QAD to seamlessly deploy customer systems to one of a number of global cloud infrastructure providers as part of the QAD Cloud offering.  Our cloud delivery centers are certified under the ISO 9001:2008 standard for quality management, the ISO 20000:2011 standard for service management (SMS), the ISO 27001:2013 standard for information security management (ISMS), the FDA 21 CFR Part 11 requirements for electronic records and signatures, and the SSAE 16 (SOC I-Type II) requirements for reporting and compliance controls.
 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
 
Rapid change in the technology industry continued through fiscal 2018 and the manufacturing sector was focused on the IoT, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality and Predictive Analytics. In addition, our customers and the industries that we support are continually evolving with a focus on Industry 4.0, as do their expectations for integration, performance and the user experience of our software. We continue to maintain a global research and development organization that provides new product enhancements to the market on a semiannual basis in order to be responsive to industry and regulatory changes.

The enterprise software industry is continuing its transition from selling on-premise licenses to selling cloud-based solutions, which include more integration to IoT devices, social media interaction, mobile computing and platform services capabilities. In fiscal 2018, we released a major upgrade to the Enterprise Edition software suite that was focused on supply chain efficiencies and flexible manufacturing. We also introduced a new module focused on Revenue Recognition in support of new accounting standards: U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) International Financial Reporting Standard 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers that went into effect for publicly-traded companies for fiscal years beginning December 15, 2017 and thereafter.
 
We continued the transition of our business model and product suite to cloud-based offerings as we released another version of our latest user experience and QAD Enterprise Platform in the sales, service and purchasing areas of the product suite to our cloud customers. Our latest release supports mobile applications for decision making and provides insights into the health of our customers’ businesses. This offering is designed to give our customers even more value and flexibility when using our product suite with a secure browser from anywhere the user has connectivity. We take security very seriously, and with every new release we have our software verified through an outside firm by scanning all the source code and performing penetration testing to preemptively identify and remove security flaws. With our web services, rich set of API’s and the QAD Enterprise Platform, our customers can more easily connect our product suite to other applications.
 
We dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to continually enhance and expand our product suite. For example, in fiscal 2018, we continued our internationalization program in support of the expansion of our global customers. As we ended fiscal 2018 we were supporting our customers in over 70 countries with a single solution managed and maintained by QAD’s research and development organization. We see a growing trend to move toward electronic invoicing and registration of shipments and invoices with governments to prevent falsification and tax avoidance. Our goal is to provide our customers with software that assists them in meeting the legal requirements of the countries in which they do business.
 
We operate a global research and development (“R&D”) organization comprised of 420 R&D employees located in offices in the United States, India, China, Ireland, Australia, France, Belgium, Spain, Brazil, Mexico and Great Britain. Our R&D expenses totaled $47.7 million, $43.6 million and $41.2 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our software is primarily developed internally; however, we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities when we require additional resources or specific skills or knowledge. All outside development is managed by our internal R&D organization. As needed, we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing or licensing products and technology from third parties. We continually review these investments in an effort to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining enough competitive advantage to justify their costs. We routinely translate our product suite into fourteen languages and through our internationalization program we support mandatory governmental regulations and reporting requirements for over 70 countries. This is accomplished through a single offering for our customers in the cloud or on-premise, allowing them to run their businesses using a consistent core business model with the deployment model of their choice.
 
We plan to continue to manage significant product development operations internationally over the next several years. We believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development at lower costs, and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities. We continually assess the significant costs and challenges, including intellectual property protection, against the benefits of our international development activities. 
 
DIRECT AND INDIRECT SALES
 
QAD sells its products and services through direct and indirect sales channels located throughout the regions of North America, Latin America, EMEA and Asia Pacific. Each region leverages global standards and systems to enhance consistency when interacting with global customers. Additionally, we have a global strategic accounts team, which is responsible for managing QAD’s largest global customers across regions.
 
Our direct sales organization includes approximately 70 commissioned sales people. Incentive pay is a significant portion of the total compensation package for our sales staff. We continually align our sales organization and business strategies with market conditions to maintain an effective sales process. We cultivate the industries we serve within each territory through marketing, local product development and sales training.
 
Our indirect sales channel consists of approximately 40 distributors and sales agents worldwide. We do not grant exclusive rights to any of our distributors or sales agents. Our distributors and sales agents primarily sell independently to companies within their geographic territory, but may also work in conjunction with our direct sales organization. We also identify global sales opportunities through our relationships with implementation service providers, hardware vendors and other third parties.

MARKETING
 
Our marketing strategy is to differentiate our offering by focusing on our role in providing value by helping our customers achieve the vision of the Effective Enterprise. Our main marketing objectives are to leverage the measurable success in business outcomes our customers have achieved and highlight hidden costs prospects may face to increase awareness and drive leads. We do this by openly and consistently communicating with QAD customers, prospects, partners, investors and other key audiences. Our primary marketing activities include: press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company, offerings and value proposition; user conferences and events, such as Explore, as well as participation in other industry events, to create customer and prospect awareness; content marketing and engagement on social channels like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube; search engine optimization, retargeting and pay per click advertising to drive traffic to our web properties; web site development and gamification to engage and educate prospects and generate interest through product information and demonstrations, case studies, white papers, and marketing collateral; customer testimonials, references, and referrals; and sales tools and field marketing events to enable our sales organization to more effectively convert leads into customers.
 
We recognize the changing buying dynamics and are focused on engaging with prospects early in the sales cycle in order to help set the buying criteria and specifications in a way that uniquely leads to QAD. We seek to accelerate prospects through the buying journey by demonstrating the value of our products, answering questions, and removing roadblocks.
 
COMPETITION
 
Every aspect of our business is affected by strong competition from both enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application services providers. The markets for our on-premise and cloud offerings are rapidly evolving; highly competitive; and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new applications. Our customers demand greater performance and reliability with lower complexity. Cost of implementation or conversion to the cloud and cost of ongoing maintenance and subscription are constant concerns when our customers make decisions about how best to deploy their resources.
 
In the on-premise space, we compete with some of the largest and most competitive enterprise application vendors in the world, such as SAP and Oracle, who hold significant market share in the traditional marketplace. These companies have considerable financial resources and name recognition; and have established broad market solutions by developing applications targeted at many industries, not just manufacturing. They often focus heavily on positioning their size as an advantage. We typically differentiate against these companies based on the specific industry focus of our solutions as well as our customer focus. Internationally, we face competition from local companies, as well as the large enterprise application competitors, many of which have products tailored for those local markets.
 
In addition, our industry has shifted focus from on-premise to cloud and mobile computing. Most enterprise application vendors today have some focus on cloud solutions, in addition to on-premise sales, which creates an environment in which we face competition from a variety of vendors that address one or more of our applications. As a result, our cloud solutions compete with both large enterprise software vendors and cloud computing application service providers. Smaller cloud computing vendors have so far targeted the lower end of the manufacturing supply chain market where companies operate in a single plant or single currency environment focusing mainly in the U.S. domestic market. Adding to this, other vendors that provide services in different markets may develop solutions in our target markets and some potential customers may elect to develop their own internal solutions.
 
We believe the key competitive factors in our markets are:
 

• | Customer focus
--+---------------


• | Customer outcomes
--+------------------


• | Flexibility to meet changing business requirements
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | Total cost of ownership
--+------------------------


• | Performance and reliability

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Speed and ease of deployment, use and maintenance
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | Financial resources; and
--+-------------------------


• | Reputation of the vendor.
--+--------------------------

 
We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. To further our market success, we must continue to respond promptly and effectively to technological change and competitors’ innovations. Our ability to remain competitive will depend on our efforts in the areas of product development and sales, services and support operations.
