Overview

We are the leading North American producer of coated papers, which are used primarily in commercial print, magazines, catalogs, high-end advertising brochures and annual reports, among other media and marketing publications. We produce a wide range of products, ranging from coated freesheet and coated groundwood, to specialty papers, to inkjet and digital paper, supercalendered papers and uncoated freesheet. We also produce and sell market kraft pulp, which is used to manufacture printing and writing paper grades and tissue products.
We operate thirteen paper machines at seven mills located in Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, as of December 31, 2017. The mills have an aggregate annual production capacity of approximately 2,870,000 tons of paper, including coated papers and specialty papers which excludes pulp. In February 2018, we announced plans to upgrade the shuttered No. 3 paper machine at our Androscoggin Mill in Jay, Maine, enabling this equipment to restart for the manufacture of packaging products. This paper machine was previously idled beginning in January 2017 and shut down in July 2017. We anticipate completion of this upgrade in the third quarter of 2018 and expect the No. 3 paper machine to increase annual paper production capacity by approximately 200,000 tons.

We sell and market our products to approximately 300 customers which comprise approximately 1,700 end-user accounts. We have long-standing relationships with many leading magazine and catalog publishers, commercial printers, specialty retail merchandisers and paper merchants. Our relationships with our ten largest coated paper customers average more than 20 years. We reach our end-users through several distribution channels, including direct sales, commercial printers, paper merchants and brokers.
History
We began operations on August 1, 2006, when we acquired the assets and certain liabilities comprising the business of the Coated and Supercalendered Papers Division of International Paper. We were formed for the purpose of consummating the acquisition from International Paper. We completed our initial public offering of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange in May 2008. On January 7, 2015, we acquired NewPage Holdings, Inc., also a paper manufacturer, in a merger transaction. The NewPage acquisition provided us with assets in a complementary geographic area, a broader portfolio of products and strategic flexibility to reduce operating costs. 
On January 26, 2016, or the “Petition Date,” Verso and substantially all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, or the “Debtors,” filed voluntary petitions for relief, or the “Chapter 11 Filings,” under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, or the “Bankruptcy Code,” in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, or the “Bankruptcy Court.” The chapter 11 cases, or the “Chapter 11 Cases,” were consolidated for procedural purposes only and administered jointly under the caption “In re: Verso Corporation, et al., Case No. 16-10163.” On June 23, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Debtors’ First Modified Third Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code dated as of June 20, 2016, or the “Plan.” On July 15, 2016, or the 
3

“Effective Date,” the Plan became effective pursuant to its terms and the Debtors emerged from their Chapter 11 Cases. As a result of the Plan, among other things, all of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date was cancelled and our creditors existing immediately prior to the Effective Date received all of our newly issued common stock in exchange for the cancellation of all of our pre-petition indebtedness.  
In accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or “FASB,” Accounting Standards Codification, or “ASC” 852, Reorganizations, the Debtors adopted fresh-start accounting upon emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases and became a new entity for financial reporting purposes as of July 15, 2016. Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial Statements for the reporting entity subsequent to emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, or the “Successor,” are not comparable to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the reporting entity prior to emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, or the “Predecessor.” For more information on the Chapter 11 Cases, including a detail of liabilities subject to compromise and reorganization items, net see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.
In December 2016, Verso Corporation completed a consolidation and reorganization of its subsidiaries, or the “Internal Reorganization.” The Internal Reorganization involved several separate, but related, actions consisting of mergers between subsidiaries to reduce their numbers, the conversion of corporate subsidiaries to limited liability companies, the re-domestication of subsidiaries under Delaware law to provide for a uniform and enlightened regulatory framework, the formation of new holding companies to create separate “branches” for Verso’s paper-making and energy operations, and name changes of subsidiaries to more appropriately reflect the nature of their assets and operations. Management believes that the Internal Reorganization will afford greater efficiency and reduced costs in the administration of its subsidiaries.
In September 2017, we announced the formation of a Strategic Alternatives Committee, comprised solely of independent directors. The Strategic Alternatives Committee is leading our efforts to identify and evaluate a range of potential strategic transaction alternatives, including the possible sale or merger of our entire company or the possible sale of some of our mills. This strategic alternatives process is ongoing and we have retained Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc. to assist in the process. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business - We cannot assure you that our exploration of strategic alternatives will result in a transaction or that any such transaction would be successful, and the process of exploring strategic alternatives or its conclusion could adversely impact our business and our stock price.”
Verso Corporation was incorporated in 2006 in the state of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 8540 Gander Creek Drive, Miamisburg, Ohio 45342. Our telephone number is (877) 855-7243. Our website address is www.versoco.com. Information on or accessible through our website is not considered part of this annual report.
Industry

Based on 2017 sales, the size of the global coated paper industry is estimated to be approximately $32 billion, or 38 million tons of coated paper shipments, including approximately $5 billion, or 6 million tons of coated paper shipments, in North America. Coated paper is used primarily in media and marketing applications, including catalogs, magazines and commercial printing applications, which include high-end advertising brochures, annual reports and direct mail advertising. Demand is generally driven by North American advertising and print media trends, which in turn have historically been correlated with growth in Gross Domestic Product, or “GDP.” The coated paper industry has been facing a decline in demand. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business - The paper industry has been facing a long-term structural decline and our profitability has been adversely impacted by such decline.”
In North America, coated papers are classified by brightness and fall into five grades, labeled No. 1 to No. 5, with No. 1 having the highest brightness level and No. 5 having the lowest brightness level. Papers graded No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 are typically coated freesheet grades. No. 4 and No. 5 papers are predominantly groundwood containing grades. Coated groundwood grades are the preferred grades for catalogs and magazines, while coated freesheet is more commonly used in commercial print applications.
Within the paper industry, specialty papers are products which are given unique characteristics in their manufacture, converting or processing and that have properties suitable for special purposes, or custom engineered applications. Specialty papers have unique functional properties and are usually produced in relatively small quantities for a specific product, function or end-use requirement. Commercial and development activities rely largely on defining the unique characteristics of an application, in contrast with other substrates. We have focused on the following markets within the specialty papers arena: label and converting, flexible packaging and technical papers. Based on our market research, we estimate the annual demand for specialty papers in all markets to be between 11 and 14 million tons globally.

Products

We manufacture printing papers, which includes coated freesheet paper and uncoated freesheet paper, coated groundwood paper, supercalendered paper and a wide range of specialty papers. These paper grades are differentiated primarily by their respective brightness, weight, print quality, functionality, bulk, opacity and strength. We also produce and sell Northern Bleached Hardwood Kraft, or “NBHK,” pulp.

As a result of our scale and technological capabilities, we are able to offer our customers a broad product offering, from ultra-lightweight coated groundwood to heavyweight coated freesheet. Our customers have the opportunity to sole-source all of their coated paper needs from us while optimizing their choice of paper products. As our customers’ preferences change, they can switch paper grades to meet their desired balance between cost and performance attributes while maintaining their relationship with us.

Printing papers. Printing papers include coated freesheet paper and uncoated freesheet papers. Coated freesheet paper is made from bleached kraft pulp, which is produced using a chemical process to break apart wood fibers and dissolve impurities such as lignin. The use of kraft pulp results in a bright, heavier-weight paper with excellent print qualities, which is well-suited for high-end commercial applications and premium magazines. Coated freesheet contains primarily kraft pulp, with less than 10% mechanical pulp in its composition. Revenue from our printing paper sales represented approximately 56%, 57% and 56% of our total revenues for fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.
Specialty paper. We offer customized product solutions for strategic accounts by producing paper grades with customer-specified weight, brightness and pulp mix characteristics, providing customers with cost benefits and/or brand differentiation. Our specialty papers portfolio focuses on functionality, printability and innovative solutions to provide over 200 specialty paper grades for use in an array of end use applications including label and converting, flexible packing and technical papers. End uses range from beverage container labels, to oil and grease resistant food containers, to pressure sensitive labels and thermal printing papers. Revenue from our specialty paper sales represented approximately 19%, 21% and 23% of our total revenues for fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.
Coated groundwood paper. Coated groundwood paper includes a fiber component produced through a mechanical pulping process. The use of such fiber results in a bulkier and more opaque paper that is better suited for applications where lighter weights and/or higher stiffness are required, such as catalogs and magazines. In addition to mechanical pulp, coated groundwood paper typically includes a kraft pulp component to improve brightness and print quality. Revenue from our coated groundwood paper sales represented approximately 14%, 12% and 9% of our total revenues for fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.
Supercalendered paper. Supercalendered paper consists of groundwood fibers and a very high filler content but it does not receive a separate surface coating. Instead, the paper is passed through a supercalendering process in which alternating steel and filled rolls “iron” the paper, giving it a gloss and smoothness that makes it resemble coated paper. Supercalendered papers are primarily used for retail inserts, due to their relatively low price point. Revenue from our supercalendered paper sales represented approximately 5%, 6% and 6% of our total revenues for fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.
Pulp. We produce and sell NBHK pulp. NBHK pulp is produced through the chemical kraft process using hardwoods. Hardwoods typically have shorter length fibers than softwoods and are used in a variety of end use applications. Kraft describes pulp produced using a chemical process, whereby wood chips are combined with chemicals and steam to separate the wood fibers. The fibers are then washed and pressure screened to remove the chemicals and lignin which originally held the fibers together. Finally, the pulp is bleached to the necessary whiteness and brightness. Kraft pulp is used in applications where brighter and whiter paper is required. We also offer de-inked pulp to help meet specific customer requirements. Revenue from our pulp sales represented approximately 6%, 4% and 6% of our total revenues for fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.

Manufacturing

As of December 31, 2017, we operate thirteen paper machines at seven mills located in Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. We believe our graphic, packaging and specialty paper mills are among the most efficient and lowest cost paper mills in North America based on the cash cost of delivery to Chicago, Illinois. We attribute our manufacturing efficiency, in part, to investments made in our mills, our R-GAP manufacturing benchmarking and our cost improvement program. As of December 31, 2017, our mills have a combined annual production capacity of 2,870,000 tons of paper, including coated papers and specialty papers. Our facilities are strategically located within close proximity to major publication printing customers, which affords us the ability to more quickly and cost-effectively deliver our products.

The following table provides key information about our mills and operating paper machines’ capacity as of December 31, 2017:

Mill/Location | Product/Paper Grades | PaperMachines | | Annual ProductionCapacity(in tons)
Duluth, Minnesota | Supercalendered paper | | 1 | | 270,000 
Escanaba, Michigan | Coated, specialty and uncoated paper | | 3 | | 730,000 
Jay (Androscoggin), Maine | Coated, specialty and uncoated paper | | 2 (1) | | 250,000 (1)
Luke, Maryland | Coated paper | | 2 | | 450,000 
Quinnesec, Michigan | Coated freesheet | | 1 | | 430,000 
Stevens Point, Wisconsin | Specialty paper | | 2 | | 200,000 
Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin | Coated paper | | 2 | | 540,000 

(1) On February 15, 2018, we announced a plan to upgrade and restart the No. 3 paper machine in the third quarter of 2018, increasing annual paper production capacity by approximately 200,000 tons. 
The basic raw material of the papermaking process is wood pulp. The first stage of papermaking involves converting wood logs to pulp through either a mechanical or chemical process. Before logs can be processed into pulp, they are passed through a debarking drum to remove the bark. Once separated, the bark is burned as fuel in bark boilers. The wood logs are composed of small cellulose fibers which are bound together by a glue-like substance called lignin. The cellulose fibers are then separated from each other through either a mechanical or a kraft pulping process.

After the pulping phase, the fiber furnish is run onto the forming fabric of the paper machine. On the forming fabric, the fibers become interlaced, forming a mat of paper, and much of the water is extracted. The paper web then goes through a pressing and drying process to extract the remaining water. After drying, the web goes through a series of on machine and off machine finishing and converting processes that impact product specific attributes to ensure excellent downstream performance. Finally, the paper is wrapped, labeled and shipped.

We utilize a manufacturing excellence program, called R-GAP, to take advantage of the financial opportunities that exist between the current or historical performance of our mills and the best performance possible given usual and normal constraints (i.e., configuration, geographical and capital constraints). Our continuous improvement process is designed to lower our cost position and enhance operating efficiency through reduced consumption of energy and material inputs, reduced spending on indirect costs, and improved productivity. The program utilizes benchmarking data to identify improvement initiatives and establish performance targets. Detailed action plans are used to monitor the execution of these initiatives and calculate the amount saved. We also use multi-variable testing, lean manufacturing, center of excellence teams, source-of-loss initiatives and best practice sharing to constantly improve our manufacturing processes and products. Since 2001, the Quinnesec Mill has been recognized in the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s Voluntary Protection Program as a Star facility. The Michigan Voluntary Protection Program Star award is the state’s highest recognition for workplace safety programs and performance. Each year we develop and implement new efforts to continue our safety improvement and also share our successes through the mentoring aspects of this important program.  
Raw Materials and Suppliers

Our key cost inputs in the papermaking process are wood fiber, chemicals and energy.

Wood Fiber. We source our wood fiber from a broad group of timberland and sawmill owners located in the regions around our mills. Our costs to purchase wood are affected directly by market costs of wood in our regional markets and indirectly by the effect of higher fuel costs on logging and transportation of timber to our facilities. While we have fiber supply agreements in place that ensure a substantial portion of our wood requirements, purchases under these agreements are typically at market rates.

Chemicals. Chemicals utilized in the manufacturing of coated papers include latex, clay, starch, calcium carbonate, caustic soda, sodium chlorate and titanium dioxide. We purchase these chemicals from a variety of suppliers and are not dependent on any single supplier to satisfy our chemical needs. Occasionally imbalances in supply and demand create volatility in prices for certain chemicals.

6

Energy. In 2017, we produced a significant portion of our energy needs for our paper mills from sources such as waste wood, hydroelectric facilities, liquid biomass from our pulping process and internal energy cogeneration facilities. Our external energy purchases vary across each of our mills and include fuel oil, natural gas, coal and electricity. Our overall energy expenditures are mitigated by our internal energy production capacity and ability to switch between certain energy sources. We also consider the use of derivative contracts as part of our risk management strategy to manage our exposure to market fluctuations in energy prices. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

We reach our end-users through several sales channels. These include selling directly to end-users, through brokers, merchants and printers. We sell and market products to approximately 300 customers, which comprise approximately 1,700 end-user accounts.

Sales to End-Users. In 2017, we sold approximately 32% of our paper products directly to end-users, most of which are specialty converters and catalog and magazine publishers. These customers are typically large, sophisticated buyers who have the scale, resources and expertise to procure paper directly from manufacturers. Customers for our pulp products are mostly other paper manufacturers.

Sales to Brokers and Merchants. Our largest indirect paper sales by volume are through brokers and merchants who resell the paper to end-users. In 2017, our total sales to brokers and merchants represented approximately 47% of our total sales. Brokers typically act as an intermediary between paper manufacturers and smaller end-users who do not have the scale or resources to cost effectively procure paper directly from manufacturers. The majority of the paper sold to brokers is resold to catalog publishers. We work closely with brokers to achieve share targets in the catalog, magazine and insert end-user segments through collaborative selling.

Merchants are similar to brokers in that they act as an intermediary between the manufacturer and the end-user. However, merchants generally take physical delivery of the product and keep inventory on hand. Merchants tend to deal with smaller end-users that lack the scale to warrant direct delivery from the manufacturer. Coated freesheet comprises the majority of our sales to merchants. In most cases, because they are relatively small, the ultimate end-users of paper sold through merchants are generally regional or local commercial printers.
Sales to Printers. In 2017, our total sales to printers represented approximately 21% of our total sales. The majority of our sales were to the two largest publication printers in the United States. Printers also effectively act as an intermediary between manufacturers and end-users in that they directly source paper for printing/converting and then resell it to their customers as a finished product.

The majority of our products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facilities to the printer or converter, regardless of the sales channel. In order to serve the grade No. 3 coated freesheet market, we maintain a network of distribution centers located in the West, Midwest, South and Northeast close to our customer base to provide quick delivery. The majority of our pulp products are delivered to our customers’ paper mills.

Our sales force is organized around our sales channels. We maintain an active dialogue with all of our major customers and track product performance and demand across grades. We have a team of sales representatives and marketing professionals organized into three major sales groups that correspond with our sales channels: direct sales support; support to brokers and merchants; and printer support.

Many of our customers provide us with forecasts of their paper needs, which allows us to plan our production runs in advance, optimizing production over our integrated mill system and thereby reducing costs and increasing overall efficiency. Generally, our sales agreements do not extend beyond the calendar year. Typically, our sales agreements provide for quarterly or semiannual price adjustments based on market price movements.
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included elsewhere in this report for information regarding seasonality and the effect of inflation on our operating results.

Customers

We participate in the printing papers, specialty papers and pulp markets and have developed long-standing relationships with many premier customers in these areas. Our relationships with our ten largest customers average more than 20 years. Our largest customer, Veritiv Corporation, accounted for approximately 19% of our net sales in 2017. Our key customers in the printing papers arena include Central National-Gottesman, Quad/Graphics, Inc., RR Donnelley & Sons Company, Veritiv and Midland Paper. Verso’s key customers in the specialty papers market include Avery Dennison, UPM Raflatac and Green Bay Packaging.
Research and Development

The primary function of our research and development efforts is to work with customers in developing and modifying products to accommodate their evolving needs and to identify cost-saving opportunities within our operations. Over the past several years, examples of our research and development efforts include innovative and performance-driven products for the flexible packaging, label and specialty printing markets.
Intellectual Property

We have several patents and patent applications in the United States and various foreign countries. These patents and patent applications generally relate to various paper manufacturing methods and equipment which may become commercially viable in the future. We also have trademarks for our name, Verso®, as well as for our products such as Sterling®, Futura®, Anthem Plus®, Productolith®, Influence®, Liberty® and Voyager®. In addition to the intellectual property that we own, we license a significant portion of the intellectual property used in our business on a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive basis from International Paper.
Competition
Our business is highly competitive. A significant number of North American competitors produce coated papers and several overseas manufacturers, principally from Europe, export to North America. We compete based on a number of factors, including:

• | price;


• | product availability;


• | product quality;


• | customer service;


• | breadth of product offerings; and


• | timeliness of product delivery.

Foreign competition in North America is affected by the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, especially the euro, market prices in North America and other markets, worldwide supply and demand, and the cost of ocean-going freight.

While our product offering is broad in terms of grades produced (from coated and uncoated graphical grades, including web and sheeted products, to highly technical specialty grades), our largest offering is in the coated freesheet category, with about two thirds in web form and one third in sheets. This strategy is driven primarily by our alignment with the commercial print market, with a secondary focus on catalogs and magazines for our coated freesheet grades. Our specialty grades have each year become a larger portion of our overall shipments, and that growth is expected to continue. As of December 31, 2017, our principal competitors include Resolute Forest Products, UPM-Kymmene Corporation, Catalyst Paper Corp. and Sappi Limited, all of which have North American operations. UPM and Sappi are headquartered overseas and also have overseas manufacturing facilities. Catalyst is headquartered in Canada.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 4,200 employees. Approximately 70% of our hourly workforce is represented by 16 local branches of the following unions: the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Services Workers International Union; the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; the Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers; the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers; the Office & Professional Employees’ International Union; and the United Association of Journeyman and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry. All represented employees were covered by a Master Labor Agreement from 2012–2016, that covered 
8

wages and benefits. Certain represented mills also had local agreements covering general work rules. The Master Agreement expired in December 2016. The parties are engaged in collective bargaining at the Luke Mill and Escanaba Mill and continue to work under the terms and conditions of their expired agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages during the past several years, and believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.

Environmental and Other Governmental Regulations

We are subject to a wide range of federal, state, regional and local general and industry-specific environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, or “Clean Water Act,” the federal Clean Air Act, the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or “CERCLA,” the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and analogous state and local laws. Our operations also are subject to a regional regime designed to address climate change, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the northeastern United States, and in the future we may be subject to additional federal, state, regional, local or supranational legislation related to climate change and greenhouse gas controls. Among our activities subject to environmental regulation are the emissions of air pollutants, discharges of wastewater and stormwater, operation of dams, storage, treatment and disposal of materials and waste, and remediation of soil, surface water and ground water contamination. Many environmental laws and regulations provide for substantial fines or penalties and criminal sanctions for any failure to comply. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the interruption of our operations and, in some cases, facility shutdowns.
Certain of these environmental laws, such as CERCLA and analogous state laws, provide for strict liability, and under certain circumstances joint and several liability, for investigation and remediation of the release of hazardous substances into the environment, including soil and groundwater. These laws may apply to properties presently or formerly owned or operated by or presently or formerly under the charge, management or control of an entity or its predecessors, as well as to conditions at properties at which waste attributable to an entity or its predecessors was disposed. Under these environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property or a party formerly or previously in charge, management or control of real property and parties that generate or transport hazardous substances that are disposed of at real property, may be held liable for the cost to investigate or clean up that real property and for related damages to natural resources. We handle and dispose of wastes arising from our mill operations, including disposal at on-site landfills. We are required to maintain financial assurance (in the form of letters of credit and other similar instruments) for the expected cost of landfill closure and post-closure care. We may be subject to liability, including liability for investigation and cleanup costs, if contamination is discovered at one of our current or former paper mills or another location where we have disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, wastes. We could be subject to potentially significant fines, penalties, criminal sanctions, plant shutdowns, or interruptions in operations for any failure to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits.

Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We have made, and will continue to make, significant expenditures to comply with these requirements and our permits. We incurred environmental capital expenditures of $1 million in 2017, $4 million in 2016 and $3 million in 2015, and we anticipate that environmental compliance will require increased capital expenditures and operating expenses over time as environmental laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof, change or the nature of our operations requires us to make significant additional capital expenditures.

Permits are required for the operation of our mills and related facilities. The permits are subject to renewal, modification and revocation. We and others have the right to challenge our permit conditions through administrative and legal appeals and review processes. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with the permits, and violators are subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, injunctions or both. Other parties also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance with the permits.
