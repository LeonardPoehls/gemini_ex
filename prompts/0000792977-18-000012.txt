ITEM 1. BUSINESS:
Overview
AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1981. We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and delivering important therapeutics, conducting clinical research in areas of unmet need and creating education and support programs for the patients and families we serve. Our currently marketed products support the health of patients in the areas of maternal and women’s health, anemia management and cancer supportive care, including Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection), Intrarosa® (prasterone) vaginal inserts, Feraheme® (ferumoxytol injection) for intravenous (“IV”) use, and MuGard® Mucoadhesive Oral Wound Rinse. In addition, in February 2017, we acquired the rights to research, develop and commercialize bremelanotide in North America. Through services related to the preservation of umbilical cord blood stem cell and cord tissue units operated through Cord Blood Registry® (“CBR”), we also help families to preserve newborn stem cells, which are used today in transplant medicine for certain cancers and blood, immune and metabolic disorders, and which we believe have the potential to play a valuable role in the ongoing development of regenerative medicine.
We intend to expand the impact of these and future products and services for patients by delivering on our growth strategy, which includes organic growth, as well as the pursuit of additional products and companies that align with our existing therapeutic areas or that could benefit from our proven core competencies. Currently, our primary sources of revenue are from product sales of Makena and Feraheme and service revenue from the CBR Services.
Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the trading symbol “AMAG.”

Makena
Overview
Makena is currently the only FDA-approved drug indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women pregnant with a single baby who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth. We acquired the rights to Makena in connection with our acquisition of Lumara Health Inc. (“Lumara Health”) in November 2014.
Makena was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) in February 2011 as an intramuscular (“IM”) injection (the “Makena IM product”) packaged in a multi-dose vial and as of February 2016 was also available in a single-dose preservative-free vial. In February 2018, Makena was also approved by the FDA for administration via a pre-filled subcutaneous auto-injector (the “Makena auto-injector”), a drug-device combination product. Makena is administered weekly by a healthcare professional with treatment beginning between 16 weeks and 20 weeks and six days of gestation and continuing until 36 weeks and six days of gestation or delivery, whichever happens first. We currently sell Makena (and expect to sell the auto-injector) primarily to specialty pharmacies, specialty distributors, and pharmacies which, in turn, sell Makena to healthcare providers, hospitals, government agencies and integrated delivery systems. In 2017, sales of Makena accounted for approximately 63% of our total net revenues. 
The approval of the auto-injector was based in part on data from a pharmacokinetic (“PK”) study, which demonstrated comparable bioavailability between the subcutaneous auto-injector product and the Makena IM product in 120 healthy post-menopausal women. No serious adverse events were reported in the PK study and the drug was generally well tolerated. The most common side effects of Makena include injection site reactions (pain, swelling, itching, bruising, or a hard bump), hives, itching, nausea, and diarrhea. The most common side effect reported with the Makena auto-injector (and higher than with the Makena IM product) was injection site pain. 
The Makena auto-injector was designed with features, such as a shorter, thinner, non-visible needle compared to the Makena IM product, to help address some of the known barriers to treatment of recurrent preterm birth, including the lack of patient acceptance and adherence. As such, based on market research we conducted, we believe that many healthcare professionals and patients will prefer the auto-injector over the IM administration. However, some healthcare professionals and/or patients may continue to employ the IM method of administration. The orphan drug exclusivity period that was granted to 
3

the Makena product in 2011, expired on February 3, 2018 and accordingly, we expect to face generic competition to the Makena IM product in mid-2018, however generics could enter the market at any time. In anticipation of generic competition, we have entered into an agreement with a generic partner and are prepared to launch our own authorized generic upon the first entry of a generic Makena injection in order to participate in the expected generic market for Makena.
Preterm Birth
Makena is a progestin whose active ingredient is hydroxyprogesterone caproate (“HPC”), which is a synthetic chemical structurally related to progesterone. Progestins, such as HPC, and progesterone belong to a class of drugs called progestogens. Progestogens have been studied to reduce preterm birth and have shown varying results depending upon the subjects enrolled. The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (the “SMFM”) Publications Committee published clinical guidelines for the use of progestogens to reduce the risk of preterm birth in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology in May 2012, and which were reaffirmed in January 2017. The SMFM Clinical Guidelines recommend the use of an IM HPC injection to reduce the risk of recurrent preterm birth for clinically indicated patients. Further, in its January 2017 reaffirmation of the 2012 SMFM Clinical Guidelines, the SMFM stated that vaginal progesterone should not be considered a substitute for HPC in women with a history of spontaneous preterm birth.
Preterm birth is defined as a birth prior to 37 weeks of pregnancy. According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”), preterm birth affected nearly 400,000 babies born in the U.S. in 2016, or one of every ten infants, with approximately 70% considered late preterm births. In the CDC's September 2017 National Center for Health Statistics Report, it noted that the preterm birth rate rose in 2016 for the second straight year and attributed the rise primarily to an increase in late preterm births, defined as a birth between 34 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Although the causes of preterm birth are not fully understood, certain women are at a greater risk for preterm birth, including those who have had a previous preterm birth, are pregnant with multiples or have certain uterine or cervical problems. High blood pressure, pregnancy complications (such as placental problems) and certain other health or lifestyle factors may also be contributing factors. Makena is indicated only for use in women who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth who are pregnant with a single baby, which accounts for approximately 140,000 pregnancies annually in the U.S. 
Preterm birth can increase the risk of infant death and can also result in serious long-term health issues for the child, including respiratory problems, gastrointestinal conditions, cerebral palsy, developmental delays, and vision and hearing impairments. According to a 2007 report by the Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Understanding Premature Birth and Assuring Healthy Outcome, the annual societal economic cost associated with preterm birth is at least $26.2 billion and includes medical and healthcare costs for the baby, labor and delivery costs for the mother, early intervention and special education services, and costs associated with lost work and pay.
Post-Approval Commitments for Makena
Makena was approved under the provisions of the FDA’s “Subpart H” Accelerated Approval regulations. The Subpart H regulations allow certain drugs, for serious or life-threatening conditions, to be approved on the basis of surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval under Subpart H, the FDA required that Makena’s sponsor perform certain adequate and well-controlled post-approval clinical studies to verify and describe the clinical benefit of Makena as well as fulfill certain other post-approval commitments. We have completed a PK study of women taking Makena. In addition, the following clinical studies for Makena are currently ongoing: (a) an efficacy and safety clinical study of Makena and (b) a follow-up study of the babies born to mothers from the efficacy and safety clinical study. Given the patient population (i.e., pregnant women who are at elevated risk for recurrent preterm delivery based on their pregnancy history) and the informed risk of receiving a placebo instead of the active approved drug, the pool of prospective subjects for such clinical trials in the U.S. is small and we have therefore sought enrollment on a global scale. We expect to complete the studies by December 2018 and October 2020, respectively. 
CBR Services
Overview
CBR is the largest private newborn stem cell bank in the world and offers pregnant women and their families the ability to preserve their newborns’ umbilical cord blood and cord tissue for potential future use (the “CBR Services”). We acquired CBR in August 2015. Additional details regarding our acquisition of CBR can be found in Note C, “Business Combinations,” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
4

We market and sell the CBR Services directly to consumers, who pay for the services directly, as third-party insurance and reimbursement are not available. Even though our business is limited to the sale of services required to collect, process, and store umbilical cord blood stem cells and cord tissue, the FDA regulates such services as products. 
The CBR Services include the collection, processing and storage of both umbilical cord blood and cord tissue. As of December 31, 2017, CBR stored approximately 700,000 umbilical cord blood and cord tissue units, which we estimate to represent nearly 40% of all privately stored cord blood and cord tissue units in the U.S. In 2017, revenue from the CBR Services accounted for approximately 19% of our total net revenues.
CBR partners with reputable research institutions on FDA-regulated clinical trials investigating the use of cord blood in regenerative medicine applications across a wide variety of conditions that have no cure today, including autism, acquired hearing loss and cerebral palsy. In addition, in an effort to realize the full potential of newborn stem cells, CBR’s Newborn Possibilities Program® provides free processing and five years of free storage of cord blood and cord tissue for families with a qualifying medical need, as discussed further below. 
In 2005, the Institute of Medicine (“IOM”) issued a comprehensive report to Congress on cord blood banking. The report contained clear recommendations that healthcare professionals should provide all expectant parents with fair and balanced education on cord blood preservation prior to labor and delivery, thereby enabling families to make an informed decision regarding their options: preserve their newborns’ stem cells for potential future family use, donate the cells for public use or research, or dispose of the cord blood. The IOM report has helped guide health policy at the state level and to date, 29 states have passed some form of cord blood education legislation, the majority of which follow the IOM recommendations. Several other states are in various stages of developing similar legislation to help inform healthcare providers and expectant parents of all medically appropriate options for preserving cord blood stem cells. In support of this legislation, CBR collaborates with outside organizations to develop education initiatives to provide quality, relevant information to expectant parents, and medical professionals, including courses where continuing medical education credits can be earned, regarding new parents’ options for newborn stem cell preservation. 
CBR has been accredited by the AABB (formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks) since 1998 and the company’s quality standards have been recognized through International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001:2008 certification - the global business standard for quality. In addition, CBR is also certified by CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments), a federal program to ensure quality laboratory testing and is FDA-registered. We believe that maintaining these accreditations, while not a requirement for preserving stem cells, are an important indicator of the quality of our services and the CBR brand.
Cord Blood and Cord Tissue
Cord blood comes from a newborn’s umbilical cord and can only be collected immediately after birth. It contains hematopoietic stem cells, which have been used in the treatment of over 80 diseases, including various cancers, blood disorders, immune disorders and metabolic disorders. Cord blood also contains a variety of other types of stem cells and monocytes that are being investigated for a variety of other therapeutic applications. Cord tissue contains mesenchymal stem cells, which are unique stem cells that are being investigated for their ability to help repair and heal the body in different ways than cord blood stem cells. Although there are not yet any conditions proven to be treatable with cord tissue, these cells have potential for use in regenerative medicine and are currently being evaluated in over 30 clinical trials mostly outside of the U.S. for their potential to treat heart disease, autoimmune disorders and orthopedic conditions. Approximately 79% of the stem cell units released by CBR have been used for experimental regenerative therapies.
Feraheme
Overview
Feraheme was approved for marketing by the FDA in June 2009 for the treatment of IDA in adult patients with CKD only and was commercially launched shortly thereafter. In February 2018, we received FDA approval to expand the Feraheme label to treat all eligible adult IDA patients who have intolerance to oral iron or have had unsatisfactory response to oral iron in addition to patients who have CKD. In 2017, sales of Feraheme for the treatment of CKD accounted for approximately 17% of our total net revenues. 
The recently expanded Feraheme label is supported by two positive pivotal Phase 3 trials evaluating Feraheme versus iron sucrose or placebo in a broad population of patients with IDA. It was also supported by positive results from a third Phase 3 randomized, double-blind non-inferiority trial that evaluated the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions 
5

(including anaphylaxis) and moderate-to-severe hypotension with Feraheme compared to Injectafer® (ferric carboxymaltose injection) (the “Feraheme comparator trial”). Approximately 2,000 IDA patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of two treatment groups, those receiving 1.02 grams of Feraheme infusion or those receiving 1.5 grams of Injectafer® infusion. The Feraheme comparator trial demonstrated non-inferiority to Injectafer® based on the primary endpoint of the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) and moderate-to-severe hypotension (Feraheme incidence 0.6%; Injectafer® incidence 0.7%). The Feraheme comparator trial also met an additional safety endpoint based on a composite of the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions, serious cardiovascular events, and/or death (Feraheme incidence 1.3%; Injectafer® incidence 2.0%). In addition, the Feraheme comparator trial met important secondary efficacy endpoints: the demonstration of non-inferiority to Injectafer® comparing mean improvement in (a) hemoglobin per gram of iron administered from baseline to week 5 (1.35 g/dL Feraheme versus 1.10 g/dL Injectafer®) and (b) hemoglobin per course of treatment from baseline to week 5 (Feraheme: 1.38 g/dL; Injectafer: 1.63 g/dL). Adverse event rates were similar across both treatment groups, however, the incidence of severe hypophosphatemia (defined by blood phosphorous of <0.6 mmol/L at week 2) was less in the patients receiving Feraheme (0.4% of patients) compared to those receiving Injectafer® (38.7% of patients).
Iron Deficiency Anemia
Currently there are two methods of iron therapy used to treat IDA: oral iron supplements and IV iron. Oral iron is currently the first-line iron replacement therapy for most physicians. However, oral iron supplements are poorly absorbed by many patients, which may adversely impact their effectiveness, and are associated with certain side effects, such as constipation, diarrhea, and cramping, that may adversely affect patient compliance in using such products. In addition, it can take an extended time for hemoglobin levels to improve following the initiation of oral iron treatment, and even then the targeted hemoglobin levels may not be reached. Conversely, iron given intravenously allows larger amounts of iron to be provided to patients in a shorter time frame while avoiding many of the side effects and treatment compliance issues associated with oral iron, and can result in faster rises in hemoglobin levels. We believe that IV iron is underutilized in IDA patients, and thus a significant opportunity remains to grow the market for IV iron in this patient population. 
IDA is widely prevalent in many different patient populations. For many of these patients, treatment with oral iron is unsatisfactory or is not tolerated. It is estimated that more than 4.5 million people in the U.S. have IDA (CKD and non-CKD) and we estimate that a small fraction of the patients who are diagnosed with IDA regardless of the underlying cause are currently being treated with IV iron. We estimate that the size of the total 2017 U.S. non-dialysis IV iron replacement therapy market was approximately 1.2 million grams. We believe that approximately half, or 600,000 grams, of the IV iron administered was for the treatment of non-dialysis patients with CKD and the other half was for non-CKD patients with IDA due to other causes, including patients with gastrointestinal diseases or disorders, inflammatory diseases, chemotherapy-induced anemia and abnormal uterine bleeding (“AUB”). 

• | Chronic Kidney Disease: CKD is a progressive condition that leads to chronic and permanent loss of kidney function. It contributes to the development of many complications, including anemia, hypertension, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid/base abnormalities, bone disease and cardiovascular disease. Anemia, a common condition among CKD patients, is associated with cardiovascular complications, decreased quality of life, hospitalizations, and increased mortality. Anemia can develop early during the course of CKD and worsens with advancing kidney disease. Based on data contained in a 2009 publication in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, we estimate that there are at least 1.6 million adults in the U.S. diagnosed with IDA in stages 3 through 5 of CKD, who are patients in the mid to later stages of CKD but not yet on dialysis and could therefore benefit from receiving IV iron.


• | Gastrointestinal Disease: It is estimated that approximately 40% - 80% of IDA patients have gastrointestinal diseases. IDA in patients with gastrointestinal diseases is likely caused by blood loss and/or the inadequate intake or absorption of iron. Oral iron has been used to treat IDA in patients with gastrointestinal diseases, but its efficacy is variable due to inconsistent bioavailability and absorption, the high incidence of gastrointestinal side effects and patient noncompliance.


• | Cancer and chemotherapy-induced anemia: IDA is also common in patients with cancer, and it is estimated that 32% - 60% of cancer patients have iron deficiency, most of whom are anemic. Iron supplementation through both oral and IV administration plays an important role in treating anemia in cancer patients. While there may be some differences in the underlying causes of anemia and iron deficiency in cancer patients who are receiving chemotherapy and those who are not, patients in both categories may develop absolute IDA due to blood loss and/or the inadequate intake or absorption of iron. Oral iron has been used to treat IDA in cancer patients, but its efficacy is variable due to inconsistent bioavailability and absorption, a high incidence of gastrointestinal side effects, potential interactions with

6

other treatments, and patient noncompliance. IV iron has been shown in clinical trials to be well tolerated in the cancer patient population in both patients who are receiving chemotherapy and those who are not.

• | Abnormal Uterine Bleeding: IDA is commonly associated with AUB, which is defined as chronic, heavy, or prolonged uterine bleeding that can result from multiple causes, including uterine abnormalities, blood disorders, pregnancy, intrauterine devices, medications, and heavy menstrual bleeding. IDA in patients with AUB, regardless of the cause, requires treatment with iron supplementation, either by oral or IV administration.

With the expanded label, in addition to an expanded opportunity within hematology and oncology centers, our authorized wholesalers and specialty distributors can now sell Feraheme to obstetricians and gynecologists, gastroenterologists and rheumatologists. 
Paragraph IV certification
On February 5, 2016, we received a Paragraph IV certification notice letter regarding an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) submitted to the FDA by Sandoz Inc. (“Sandoz”) requesting approval to engage in commercial manufacture, use and sale of a generic version of ferumoxytol. A generic version of ferumoxytol can be marketed only with the approval of the FDA of the respective application for such generic version. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, as amended, (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”), requires an ANDA applicant whose proposed drug is a generic version of a previously-approved drug listed in the FDA publication, “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also known as the “Orange Book,” to certify to any patents listed in the Orange Book for the previously-approved drug and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification, to notify the owner of the approved application and the relevant patent-holder. The Paragraph IV certification notice is required to contain a detailed factual and legal statement explaining the basis for the applicant’s opinion that the proposed product does not infringe the subject patents, that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, or both. If a patent infringement suit is filed within 45 days of receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, a so-called 30-month stay is triggered that generally prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the expiration of the 30-month stay period, conclusion of the litigation in the generic applicant’s favor, or expiration of the patent, whichever is earlier. In its notice letter, Sandoz claims that our ferumoxytol patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed by Sandoz’s manufacture, use, sale or offer for sale of the generic version. In March 2016, we initiated a patent infringement suit alleging that Sandoz’s ANDA filing itself constituted an act of infringement and that if it is approved, the manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale or importation of Sandoz’s ferumoxytol products would infringe our patents. If the litigation is resolved in favor of the applicant or the challenged patent expires during the 30 month stay period, the stay is lifted and the FDA may thereafter approve the application based on the applicable standards for approval. By the filing of this complaint, we believe the 30 month stay was triggered and that Sandoz is prohibited from marketing its ferumoxytol product, even if it receives conditional approval from the FDA until the earliest of (a) August 5, 2018 (30 months from the date we received Sandoz's notice of certification), (b) the conclusion of litigation in Sandoz’s favor, or (c) expiration of the patent(s). On May 2, 2016, Sandoz filed a response to our patent infringement suit and the trial is scheduled for March 19, 2018. Any future unfavorable outcome in this matter could negatively affect the magnitude and timing of future Feraheme revenues. We intend to vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights relating to ferumoxytol. The ANDA process is discussed in more detail below under the heading “Pharmaceutical Product Approval Process - Abbreviated New Drug Application.”
Post-Approval Commitments for Feraheme 
As part of our post-approval Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) requirement to support pediatric labeling of Feraheme for the treatment of CKD, we had initiated a randomized, active-controlled pediatric study of Feraheme for the treatment of IDA in pediatric CKD patients. During 2015, we suspended this trial due to difficulty in enrollment. In December 2016, we met with the FDA to advance the development of a plan in order to satisfy this post-approval commitment for Feraheme and subsequently proposed a protocol to the FDA for a new pediatric study. Following recent interactions with the FDA regarding the adequacy of our proposed protocol, we amended the protocol and intend to initiate a new pediatric study in the second quarter of 2018. Further, as part of our post-approval PREA requirement to support pediatric labeling of Feraheme for the treatment of IDA for the recently approved broader label, we are required to submit a final protocol to the FDA in July 2018 with the final report submission due to the FDA in November 2022.

Intrarosa
Overview
In February 2017, we entered into a license agreement (the “Endoceutics License Agreement”) with Endoceutics pursuant to which Endoceutics granted us rights to Intrarosa, an FDA-approved product for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse), a symptom of VVA, due to menopause. The Endoceutics License Agreement grants us the right to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products containing dehydroepiandrosterone (“DHEA”), including Intrarosa, at dosage strengths of 13 mg or less per dose and formulated for intravaginal delivery, excluding any combinations with other active pharmaceutical ingredients, in the U.S. for the treatment of VVA and FSD. In April 2017, we entered into an exclusive commercial supply agreement with Endoceutics, pursuant to which Endoceutics, itself or through affiliates or contract manufacturers, agreed to manufacture and supply Intrarosa to us (the “Endoceutics Supply Agreement”). In July 2017, we announced the commercial availability of Intrarosa at pharmacies throughout the U.S. 
To support the July 2017 launch of Intrarosa, we hired a new 170 person commercial team, including a sales force of nearly 140 sales representatives dedicated to Intrarosa. This newly established sales force provides additional flexibility as our portfolio evolves, including for the potential expansion of the Intrarosa label, the potential launch of bremelanotide and for future products we may acquire or develop in the women’s health space. 
In addition, Endoceutics initiated a 600 patient placebo-controlled, double blind randomized Phase 3 clinical study in the third quarter of 2017 to support an application for U.S. regulatory approval of Intrarosa for the treatment of HSDD in post-menopausal women. We and Endoceutics have agreed to share the direct costs related to two clinical studies, including the HSDD trial, based upon a negotiated allocation with us funding up to $20.0 million. If the studies are successful, we will file a supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) with the FDA for the treatment of HSDD in post-menopausal women. Furthermore, each party's commercialization activities and budget are described in a commercialization plan, which is updated annually. Additional details regarding the Endoceutics License Agreement and the Endoceutics Supply Agreement can be found below under the heading “Collaboration, License and Other Strategic Agreements - Endoceutics”. 
Intrarosa is the only FDA-approved, vaginally administered, daily non-estrogen steroid, which is prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, due to menopause. Intrarosa contains prasterone, a synthetic version of the inactive endogenous (i.e. occurring in the body) sex hormone precursor, DHEA. Prasterone is converted by enzymes in the body into androgens and estrogens to help restore the vaginal tissue as indicated by improvements in the percentage of superficial cells, parabasal cells, and pH. The mechanism of action of Intrarosa is not fully established. The effectiveness of Intrarosa on moderate to severe dyspareunia in post-menopausal women was examined in two primary 12-week placebo-controlled efficacy trials. All women in both studies were assessed for improvement from baseline to week 12 for four co-primary efficacy endpoints: (a) most bothersome symptom (moderate to severe dyspareunia), (b) the percentage of vaginal superficial cells, (c) the percentage of parabasal cells, and (d) vaginal pH. All primary endpoints were statistically significant. Women taking Intrarosa experienced a significant reduction in moderate to severe dyspareunia, as well as statistically significant improvements in the percentage of vaginal superficial cells, parabasal cells and vaginal pH. 
A 52-week long-term safety study of 422 post-menopausal women showed no evidence of endometrial hyperplasia, a potential precursor to endometrial cancer that is associated with the use of unopposed estrogen. Vaginal discharge and atypical pap smears were the most common adverse reactions. Intrarosa is contraindicated in women with undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding. The label for Intrarosa contains a precaution that it has not been studied in women with a history of breast cancer. 
Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy and Dyspareunia
In the U.S., there are an estimated 64 million post-menopausal women, with approximately half, or 32 million, of those women suffering from symptoms of VVA. Of the 32 million women who suffer from symptoms of VVA, we estimate there are approximately 20 million women in the U.S. who suffer from dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, the majority of which we believe suffer from moderate to severe dyspareunia. We estimate that of those women, only 1.7 million are currently being treated with prescription therapy. The Women’s Health Initiative, a long-term national health study, which focused on strategies related to estrogen replacement therapy in post-menopausal women, led to class labeling for all estrogen-containing products, including a boxed safety warning. Intrarosa is not subject to a boxed warning nor any limitations to duration of use as are all other currently approved prescription products to treat VVA. 
MuGard
MuGard is indicated for the management of oral mucositis/stomatitis (that may be caused by radiotherapy and/or 
8

chemotherapy) and all types of oral wounds (mouth sores and injuries), including certain ulcers/canker sores and traumatic ulcers, such as those caused by oral surgery or ill-fitting dentures or braces. We acquired the U.S. commercial rights to MuGard under a June 2013 license agreement with Abeona (the “MuGard Rights”). MuGard was launched in the U.S. by Abeona in 2010 after receiving 510(k) clearance from the FDA. 
Bremelanotide
Overview
In January 2017, we entered into a license agreement (the “Palatin License Agreement”) with Palatin pursuant to which we acquired (a) an exclusive license in all countries of North America (the “Palatin Territory”), with the right to grant sub-licenses, to research, develop and commercialize bremelanotide and any other products containing bremelanotide (collectively, the “Bremelanotide Products”), an investigational product designed to treat acquired HSDD in pre-menopausal women, (b) a worldwide non-exclusive license, with the right to grant sub-licenses, to manufacture the Bremelanotide Products, and (c) a non-exclusive license in all countries outside the Palatin Territory, with the right to grant sub-licenses, to research and develop (but not commercialize) the Bremelanotide Products. Additional details regarding the Palatin License Agreement can be found below under the heading “Collaboration, License and Other Strategic Agreements-Palatin.” 
Bremelanotide, a melanocortin 4 receptor agonist, is currently being developed for the treatment of acquired HSDD in pre-menopausal women. Bremelanotide is designed to be an as desired therapy used in anticipation of sexual activity and self-administered by the patient in the thigh or abdomen via a single-use subcutaneous auto-injector. Two Phase 3 bremelanotide studies conducted by Palatin for the treatment of HSDD in pre-menopausal women met the pre-specified co-primary efficacy endpoints of improvement in desire and decrease in distress associated with low sexual desire as measured using validated patient-reported outcome instruments. Both trials consisted of double-blind placebo-controlled, randomized parallel group studies comparing a subcutaneous dose of 1.75 mg bremelanotide versus placebo, in each case, delivered via an auto-injector. The co-primary endpoints for these trials were evaluated using Question One and Two of the Female Sexual Function Index: Desire Domain (“FSFI-D”) and Female Sexual Distress Scale-Desires/Arousal/Orgasm (“FSDS-DAO”) Question 13 scores. For women taking bremelanotide compared to placebo, the change from baseline in FSFI-D showed statistically significant improvement in measures of desire in both Phase 3 studies, with one study demonstrating a median change of 0.60 vs. 0.00 and p=0.0002, and the other study demonstrating a median change of 0.60 vs. 0.00 and p<0.0001. These studies also demonstrated statistically significant mean changes in FSFI-D for women taking bremelanotide compared to placebo of 0.54 vs. 0.24 and 0.63 vs. 0.21. The FSDS-DAO Question 13 scores were also measured using the median change and showed statistically significant decreases in measures of distress related to low sexual desire in both Phase 3 studies for women taking bremelanotide compared to placebo, with one study demonstrating a median change of -1.0 vs. 0.0 and p<0.0001, and the other study demonstrating a median change of -1.0 vs. 0.0 and p=0.0053. These studies also demonstrated statistically significant mean changes in FSDS-DAO Question 13 scores for women taking bremelanotide compared to placebo of -0.7 vs. -0.4 for both studies. The change in the number of satisfying sexual events, a key secondary endpoint, was not significantly different from placebo in either clinical trial. Each trial consisted of over 600 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the treatment arm or placebo arm, each with a 24 week evaluation period. The most frequent adverse events were nausea, flushing and headache, which were generally mild-to-moderate in severity and were transient. Approximately 17% of patients discontinued participation in the bremelanotide arm due to adverse events in both studies versus 2% in placebo. Women in the trials had the option, after completion of the randomized trial, to continue in an ongoing open-label safety extension study for an additional 52 weeks, which gathered additional data on the safety of long-term and repeated use of bremelanotide. Nearly 80% of patients who completed the randomized portion of the study elected to remain in the open-label portion of the study. All of the patients in the extension study, which was completed in 2017, received bremelanotide. The adverse events in the extension portion of the study were consistent with that of the controlled study described above. We expect to submit an NDA for bremelanotide in the first quarter of 2018.
The Phase 3 bremelanotide studies were predicated on the results of a Phase 2b clinical study of bremelanotide conducted by Palatin. The Phase 2b clinical study was a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel group, dose-finding trial testing three dose levels, 0.75 mg, 1.25 mg and 1.75 mg, of subcutaneously administered bremelanotide against placebo in pre-menopausal women diagnosed with acquired HSDD, female sexual arousal disorder or both. The 1.75 mg dose demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant results for all predefined endpoints and was generally well-tolerated and was therefore selected as the dose to take into the Phase 3 trials. 
Female Sexual Dysfunction and Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder
FSD is defined as persistent or recurring problems during one or more of the stages of a woman's sexual response. It is multi-dimensional and can be caused by physiological, psychological, emotional and/or relational factors. FSD can also have a 
9

major impact on a woman’s sexual relationships, interpersonal relationships, quality of life, and even their general well-being. HSDD is the most common type of FSD and is characterized by a lack of sexual thoughts and desire for sexual activity, which causes a woman distress or puts a strain on the relationship with her partner, and cannot be accounted for by another medical physical or psychiatric condition, co-morbidity of another condition or the effects of a medication. Studies suggest that approximately 15 million women in the U.S. are affected by HSDD and approximately 5.8 million of these women are pre-menopausal and have a primary diagnosis of HSDD. Despite one FDA-approved HSDD therapy on the market today for pre-menopausal women, we believe that patient awareness and understanding of the condition is extremely low, and that few women currently seek treatment. HSDD may go undiagnosed due to various factors such as embarrassment or stigma, lack of awareness of low sexual desire as a medical condition or attribution to other external factors, such as stress or fatigue. Recent market research commissioned by Palatin indicates that 95% of pre-menopausal women suffering from low desire with associated distress are unaware that HSDD is a treatable medical condition. As a result, assuming FDA approval of our NDA for bremelanotide, we expect that the initial focus of our bremelanotide commercialization efforts will be raising awareness and education about the disease for both healthcare professionals and patients with this disorder. We have launched an unbranded condition awareness campaign to healthcare professionals and will be expanding it to patients later in 2018.
Collaboration, License and Other Strategic Agreements 
Endoceutics
Under the terms of the Endoceutics License Agreement, which we entered into with Endoceutics in February 2017, we made an upfront payment of $50.0 million and issued 600,000 shares of unregistered common stock to Endoceutics, which had a value of $13.5 million, as measured on April 3, 2017, the date of closing. Of these 600,000 shares, 300,000 were subject to a 180-day lock-up provision, and the other 300,000 are subject to a one-year lock-up provision. In addition, we paid Endoceutics $10.0 million in the third quarter of 2017 upon the delivery by Endoceutics of Intrarosa launch quantities and have agreed to make a payment of $10.0 million in April 2018 on the first anniversary of the closing. The anniversary payment is reflected in accrued expenses at December 31, 2017. During 2017, we recorded a total of $83.5 million of consideration paid, of which $77.7 million was allocated to the Intrarosa developed technology intangible asset and $5.8 million was recorded as in-process research and development expense based on their relative fair values.
In addition, we have also agreed to pay tiered royalties to Endoceutics equal to a percentage of net sales of Intrarosa in the U.S. ranging from mid-teens for calendar year net U.S. sales up to $150.0 million to mid twenty percent for any calendar year net sales that exceed $1.0 billion (such royalty rate to be dependent on the aggregate annual net sales of Intrarosa in the U.S.) for the commercial life of Intrarosa, subject to certain deductions. Endoceutics is also eligible to receive certain sales milestone payments, including a first sales milestone payment of $15.0 million, which would be triggered when annual net U.S. sales of Intrarosa exceed $150.0 million, and a second milestone payment of $30.0 million, which would be triggered when annual net U.S. sales of Intrarosa exceed $300.0 million. If annual net U.S. sales of Intrarosa exceed $500.0 million, there are additional sales milestone payments totaling up to $850.0 million, which would be triggered at various sales thresholds. 
We have the exclusive right to commercialize Intrarosa for the treatment of VVA and FSD in the U.S., subject to the terms of the Endoceutics License Agreement, including having final decision-making authority with respect to commercial strategy, pricing and reimbursement and other commercialization matters. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to market, promote and otherwise commercialize Intrarosa for the treatment of VVA and, if approved, FSD in the U.S. Endoceutics has the right to directly conduct additional commercialization activities for Intrarosa for the treatment of VVA and FSD in the U.S. and has the right to conduct activities related generally to the field of intracrinology, in each case, subject to our review and approval and our right to withhold approval in certain instances. Each party's commercialization activities and budget are described in a commercialization plan, which is updated annually. 

In connection with the Endoceutics License Agreement, we entered into the Endoceutics Supply Agreement with Endoceutics, which provides for the exclusive commercial supply by Endoceutics, itself or through affiliates or contract manufacturers, to manufacture and supply Intrarosa, subject to certain rights for us to manufacture and supply Intrarosa in the event of a cessation notice or supply failure.

Under the Endoceutics License Agreement, except as permitted under the Endoceutics License Agreement or the Endoceutics Supply Agreement, and except for any compounds or products affecting the melanocortin receptor pathway, including without limitation, bremelanotide (collectively, “Excluded Products”), we are not permitted to research, develop, manufacture, or commercialize (a) DHEA for delivery by any route of administration anywhere in world, (b) any compound (including DHEA) or product for use in VVA anywhere in the world, or (c) commencing on the date of an approval of Intrarosa for the treatment of FSD in the U.S. and continuing for the remainder of the term of the Endoceutics License Agreement, any compound (including DHEA) for use in FSD (each, a “Competing Product”). Any compound or product for use in FSD that 
10

would be a Competing Product in the United States but that (a) does not contain DHEA and (b) was acquired or licensed or for which the research, development, manufacture or commercialization of such compound or product is initiated by us or our affiliates, in each case, prior to the date of an approval of Intrarosa for the treatment of FSD in the U.S., will be an Excluded Product and will not be subject to the exclusivity obligations under the Endoceutics License Agreement for the treatment of FSD, subject to certain restrictions in the Endoceutics License Agreement. These noncompete restrictions are subject to certain exclusions relating to the acquisition of competing programs.
The Endoceutics License Agreement expires on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations due thereunder unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, including by either party for material breach that is either uncured after a 90-day notice period (subject to certain extensions and dispute resolutions provisions). We have the ability to elect not to terminate the Endoceutics License Agreement in the case of a material breach, in which case future milestone and royalty payments owed to Endoceutics would be reduced by a negotiated percentage or by an amount determined by arbitration. Either party may terminate under certain situations relating to the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the Endoceutics License Agreement for a valid business reason upon 365 days prior written notice to Endoceutics; or upon 60 days written notice in the event we reasonably determine in good faith, after due inquiry and after discussions with Endoceutics, that we cannot reasonably continue to develop or commercialize the product as a result of a safety issue regarding the use of Intrarosa. We may also terminate the Endoceutics License Agreement upon 180 days’ notice if there is a change of control of AMAG and the acquiring entity (alone or with its affiliates) is engaged in a competing program (as defined in the Endoceutics License Agreement) in the U.S. or in at least three countries within the European Union. 
Palatin
Under the terms of the Palatin License Agreement, which we entered into with Palatin in January 2017, we paid Palatin $60.0 million as a one-time upfront payment in 2017 and subject to agreed-upon deductions, we reimbursed Palatin approximately $25.0 million for reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Palatin in connection with the development and regulatory activities necessary to submit an NDA in the U.S. for bremelanotide for the treatment of acquired HSDD in pre-menopausal women. In addition, the Palatin License Agreement requires us to make future contingent payments of (a) up to $80.0 million upon achievement of certain regulatory milestones, including $20.0 million upon the acceptance by the FDA of our NDA for bremelanotide and $60.0 million upon FDA approval, and (b) up to $300.0 million of aggregate sales milestone payments upon the achievement of certain annual net sales in North America over the course of the license. The first sales milestone payment of $25.0 million will be triggered when bremelanotide annual net sales in North America exceed $250.0 million. We are also obligated to pay Palatin tiered royalties on annual net sales in North America of the Bremelanotide Products, on a product-by-product basis, in the Palatin Territory ranging from the high-single digits to the low double-digits. The royalties will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the latest to occur of (a) the earliest date on which there are no valid claims of Palatin patent rights covering such Bremelanotide Product in such country, (b) the expiration of the regulatory exclusivity period for such Bremelanotide Product in such country and (c) 10 years following the first commercial sale of such Bremelanotide Product in such country. These royalties are subject to reduction in the event that: (a) we must license additional third-party intellectual property in order to develop, manufacture or commercialize a Bremelanotide Product or (b) generic competition occurs with respect to a Bremelanotide Product in a given country, subject to an aggregate cap on such deductions of royalties otherwise payable to Palatin. After the expiration of the applicable royalties for any Bremelanotide Product in a given country, the license for such Bremelanotide Product in such country would become a fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license.
The Palatin License Agreement expires on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations due thereunder unless earlier terminated in accordance with the agreement. In addition, we have the right to terminate the Palatin License Agreement without cause, in its entirety or on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon at least 180 days’ prior written notice to Palatin. Either party may terminate the Palatin License Agreement for cause if the other party materially breaches or defaults in the performance of its obligations, and, if curable, such material breach remains uncured for 90 days.
Velo 
In July 2015, we entered into an option agreement with Velo, a privately held life-sciences company that granted us an option to acquire the rights to an orphan drug candidate, DIF, a polyclonal antibody in clinical development for the treatment of severe preeclampsia in pregnant women. We made an upfront payment of $10.0 million in 2015 for the option to acquire the global rights to the DIF program (the “DIF Rights”). DIF has been granted both orphan drug and fast-track review designations by the FDA for use in treating severe preeclampsia. Under the option agreement, Velo will complete a Phase 2b/3a clinical study, which began in the second quarter of 2017. Following the conclusion of the DIF Phase 2b/3a study, we may terminate, or, for additional consideration, exercise or extend, our option to acquire the DIF Rights. If we exercise the option to acquire the DIF Rights, we would be responsible for additional costs in pursuing FDA approval, and would be obligated to pay to Velo 
11

certain milestone payments and single-digit royalties based on regulatory approval and commercial sales of the product. If we exercise the option, we will be responsible for payments totaling up to $65.0 million (including the payment of the option exercise price and the regulatory milestone payments) and up to an additional $250.0 million in sales milestone payments based on the achievement of annual sales milestones at targets ranging from $100.0 million to $900.0 million. 
Antares
Through our acquisition of Lumara Health, we are party to a development and license agreement with Antares (the “Antares Agreement”), which grants us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, to certain intellectual property rights, including know-how, patents and trademarks, to develop, use, sell, offer for sale and import and export the Makena auto-injector. In consideration for the license, to support joint meetings and a development strategy with the FDA, and for initial tooling and process validation, Lumara Health paid Antares an up-front payment in October 2014. Under the Antares Agreement, we are responsible for the clinical development and preparation, submission and maintenance of all regulatory applications in each country where we desire to market and sell the Makena auto-injector, including the U.S. We are required to pay royalties to Antares on net sales of the Makena auto-injector commencing on the launch of the Makena auto-injector in a particular country until the Makena auto-injector is no longer sold or offered for sale in such country (the “Antares Royalty Term”). The royalty rates range from high single digit to low double digits and are tiered based on levels of net sales of the Makena auto-injector and decrease after the expiration of licensed patents or where there are generic equivalents to the Makena auto-injector being sold in a particular country. In addition, we are required to pay Antares sales milestone payments upon the achievement of certain annual net sales. Antares is the exclusive supplier of the device components of the Makena auto-injector and Antares remains responsible for the manufacture and supply of the device components and assembly of the Makena auto-injector. We are responsible for the supply of the drug to be used in the assembly of the finished auto-injector product. The development and license agreement terminates at the end of the Antares Royalty Term, but is subject to early termination by us for convenience and by either party upon an uncured breach by or bankruptcy of the other party. 
Abeona
In June 2013, we entered into a license agreement (the “MuGard License Agreement”) with Abeona under which Abeona granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to certain intellectual property rights, including know-how, patents and trademarks, to use, import, offer for sale, sell, manufacture and commercialize MuGard in the U.S. and its territories and possessions (the “MuGard Territory”) for the management of oral mucositis/stomatitis (that may be caused by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy) and all types of oral wounds (mouth sores and injuries), including certain ulcers/canker sores and traumatic ulcers, such as those caused by oral surgery or ill-fitting dentures or braces.
In consideration for the license, we paid Abeona an upfront license fee of $3.3 million in June 2013. We are required to pay royalties to Abeona on net sales of MuGard in the MuGard Territory until the later of (a) the expiration of the licensed patents or (b) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of MuGard in the MuGard Territory (the “MuGard Royalty Term”). These tiered, double-digit royalty rates decrease after the expiration of the licensed patents. After the expiration of the MuGard Royalty Term, the license shall become a fully paid-up, royalty-free and perpetual license in the MuGard Territory.
Abeona remains responsible for the manufacture of MuGard and we have entered into a quality agreement and a supply agreement under which we purchase MuGard inventory from them. 
Abeona is responsible for maintenance of the licensed patents at its own expense, and we retain the first right to enforce any licensed patent against third-party infringement. The MuGard License Agreement terminates at the end of the MuGard Royalty Term, but is subject to early termination by us for convenience and by either party upon an uncured breach by or bankruptcy of the other party.
Manufacturing 
Overview
We do not own or operate, and currently do not plan to own or operate, facilities for the manufacture of our commercially distributed products, product candidates or for any commercial products or product candidates we may acquire or in-license. We rely solely on third-party contract manufacturers and our licensors (who, in turn, may also rely on third-party contract manufacturers) to manufacture our products for our commercial and clinical use. Our third-party drug product contract manufacturing facilities, and those of our licensors, are subject to current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) and regulations enforced by the FDA through periodic inspections to confirm such compliance. We target to maintain, where possible, second source suppliers and/or sufficient inventory levels throughout our supply chain to meet our projected near-term 
12

demand for all of our drug products in order to minimize risks of supply disruption. For example, although we do not currently have a manufacturer for the production of HPC, our supply chain practices have resulted in inventory of HPC, which we believe to be sufficient to meet demand until we can obtain FDA approval of a new drug substance manufacturer. We intend to continue to outsource the manufacture and distribution of our products for the foreseeable future, and we believe this manufacturing strategy will enable us to direct more of our financial resources to the commercialization and development of our products and product candidates. 
We own a facility located in Tucson, Arizona, which stores all of our customers’ cord blood and cord tissue samples. We rely solely on third-party contract manufacturers and service providers for certain materials required to support the CBR Services, including to supply proprietary materials, some of whom are sole source providers. The business model for CBR Services is limited to charging customers for our services related to the collection, processing and storage of umbilical cord blood stem cells and cord tissues. Nevertheless, the FDA considers those services to constitute manufacturing of regulated materials, and enforces regulations to ensure that establishments that perform such services do so in accordance with current Good Tissue Practices. 
To support the commercialization and development of our products and services, we have developed a fully integrated manufacturing support system, including quality assurance, quality control, regulatory affairs and inventory control policies and procedures. These support systems are intended to enable us to maintain high standards of quality for our products and services.
Makena
The Makena drug product for our commercial and clinical use is currently manufactured by Pfizer under a Development and Supply Agreement (as amended and restated, the “Pfizer Agreement”). The Pfizer Agreement requires that we satisfy certain minimum purchase requirements, but we are not obligated to use Pfizer as our sole supplier of drug product. The Pfizer Agreement expires on December 31, 2022, which term will be automatically extended thereafter for additional 18 month periods, unless canceled by us or Pfizer within an agreed-upon notice period. We also have an agreement with Piramal Pharma Solutions (formerly Coldstream Laboratories, Inc.) as a second source manufacturer for the Makena 1 mL drug product. In addition, we have entered into an agreement with a supplier of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) for use in the finished Makena product. We also intend to enter into an agreement with a second source supplier to produce Makena API. Both API suppliers have filed with the FDA for approval of their sites.
Antares is the exclusive supplier for the auto-injection system devices needed for the Makena auto-injector, and Antares is responsible for the manufacture and supply of the device and assembly of the Makena auto-injector. The Antares Agreement terminates at the end of the Antares Royalty Term, but is subject to early termination by us for convenience and by either party upon an uncured breach by or bankruptcy of the other party. In addition, we are responsible for providing Antares with the supply of the Makena drug substance in pre-filled syringes to be used in the assembly of the finished auto-injector product. We also expect to enter into a manufacturing agreement for the production of the pre-filled syringes. We intend to enter into a commercial supply agreement with Antares. 
We entered into a distribution and supply agreement in December 2017 with a generic partner to launch an authorized generic of the IM formulation of Makena upon the first entry of generic competition. 
Feraheme
We are party to a Commercial Supply Agreement with Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. (“SAFC”) pursuant to which SAFC agreed to manufacture and we agreed to purchase from SAFC the API for use in the finished product of ferumoxytol for commercial sale as well as for use in clinical trials (as amended, the “SAFC Agreement”). Subject to certain conditions, the SAFC Agreement provides that we purchase all of our API from SAFC. The SAFC Agreement has an initial term that ends December 31, 2020, which may be automatically extended thereafter for additional two year periods, unless canceled by us or SAFC within an agreed-upon notice period.
We are party to a Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Patheon, Inc. (“Patheon”) pursuant to which Patheon agreed to manufacture ferumoxytol finished drug product for commercial sale and for use in clinical trials at a fixed price per vial (as amended, the “Patheon Agreement”). The Patheon Agreement will continue in force until December 31, 2020. The Patheon Agreement may be terminated at any time upon mutual written agreement by us and Patheon or at any time by us subject to certain notice requirements and early termination fees. In addition, the Patheon Agreement may be terminated by either us or Patheon in the event of a material breach of the agreement by the other party provided that the breaching party fails to cure such breach within an agreed-upon notice period. 
13

We have also entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with a second source supplier to produce ferumoxytol finished drug product in addition to Patheon. This supplier has filed with the FDA for approval of its site and we anticipate a decision in 2018. 
Intrarosa
Under the terms of the Endoceutics Supply Agreement, Endoceutics, itself or through affiliates or contract manufacturers, agreed to manufacture and supply Intrarosa to us and is our exclusive supplier of Intrarosa in the U.S., subject to certain rights for us to manufacture and supply Intrarosa in the event of a cessation notice or supply failure (as such terms are defined in the Endoceutics Supply Agreement). Under the Endoceutics Supply Agreement, Endoceutics has agreed to maintain a second source supplier for the manufacture of the drug product and identify, validate and transfer manufacturing intellectual property to the second source supplier by 2019. The Endoceutics Supply Agreement will remain in effect until the termination of the Endoceutics License Agreement, unless terminated earlier by either party for an uncured material breach or insolvency of the other party, or by us if we exercise our rights to manufacture and supply Intrarosa following a cessation notice or supply failure. 
MuGard
Under the terms of the MuGard License Agreement, Abeona is responsible for all aspects of manufacturing MuGard. We have entered into a supply agreement with Abeona under which we purchase MuGard inventory from Abeona. Our inventory purchases are at the price actually paid by Abeona to purchase it from a third-party plus a mark-up to cover administration, handling and overhead.
Bremelanotide
Under the Palatin License Agreement, we assumed a long-term commercial supply agreement for drug product manufacture and assembly services for bremelanotide. We are currently negotiating other manufacturing and supply agreements for the drug substance and auto-injector sub-assemblies and may not be able to enter into such agreements on acceptable terms, if at all. 
Raw Materials
We, our licensors and our respective third-party product manufacturers currently purchase certain raw and other materials used to manufacture our products from third-party suppliers and, at present, do not have long-term supply contracts with most of these third parties. We also rely upon third-party contractors to assist in providing the CBR Services, including to supply proprietary materials. Although certain of our raw or other materials are readily available, others may be obtained only from qualified suppliers. The qualification of an alternative source may require repeated testing of the new materials and generate greater expenses to us or our licensors if materials that we test do not perform in an acceptable manner. In addition, we, our licensors or our respective third-party manufacturers sometimes obtain raw or other materials from one vendor only, even where multiple sources are available, to maintain quality control and enhance working relationships with suppliers, which could make us susceptible to price inflation by the sole supplier, thereby increasing our production costs. As a result of the high-quality standards imposed on our raw or other materials, we, our licensors or our respective third-party manufacturers may not be able to obtain such materials of the quality required to manufacture our products or support the CBR Services from an alternative source on commercially reasonable terms, or in a timely manner, if at all. 
Patents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets 
We consider the protection of our technology to be material to our business. Because of the substantial length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through development and regulatory approval to the marketplace, we place considerable importance on obtaining patent protection and maintaining trade secret protection for our products. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability, and the ability of our licensors, collaborators and other business partners to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and other trade secrets. To do so, we must prosecute and maintain existing patents, obtain new patents and ensure trade secret protection. We must also operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties or allowing third parties to infringe our rights.
Our policy is to aggressively protect our competitive technology position by a variety of means, including applying for or obtaining rights to patents in the U.S. and in foreign countries. One of our U.S. Feraheme patents received a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act and will expire in June 2023, and the other U.S. patents relating to Feraheme will expire in 2020. In December 2017, we were issued a U.S. patent related to the Makena auto-injector product, which will expire in 2036, and we have a pending patent application related to the Makena auto-injector product. In addition, we have a license to 
14

several U.S. patents and patent applications from Antares related to the Makena auto-injector device and drug-device combination with expiration dates between 2019 and 2034. We intend to request Orange Book listing of our and Antares’ eligible patents. There are no issued patents covering the Makena IM product or the CBR Services. 
Under the Palatin License Agreement, we have exclusive rights to a number of U.S. and foreign patents and applications related to bremelanotide that are owned by Palatin. Certain of Palatin's U.S. patents include claims directed to the bremelanotide drug composition and methods of use thereof with terms expiring in 2020, and other patents include claims directed to methods of treating FSD by subcutaneous administration of compositions that include bremelanotide with terms expiring in 2033. Any one of these issued patents may be granted up to five years of patent term extension (up to a maximum patent term of 14 years after regulatory approval) pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act. Whether any of these patents will be granted patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act and the length of any such extension cannot be determined until a product covered by such patents receives FDA approval. 
Under the terms of the Endoceutics License Agreement, we received rights to U.S. patents and applications related to Intrarosa that are owned by Endoceutics. One issued patent includes drug product claims with a term that expires in 2031. Two additional issued patents include method of use claims and pharmaceutical dosage form claims with terms that expire in 2028, either of which may be granted up to five years of patent term extension (up to a maximum patent term of 14 years after regulatory approval pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act). However, there is no guarantee that the FDA will grant such an extension. 
Under the Abeona License Agreement, we have exclusive rights to two U.S. patents related to MuGard that are owned by Abeona. These Abeona patents include liquid composition claims and will expire in 2022. 
Additionally, we have an agreement with Velo that gives us an exclusive option to acquire the rights to DIF, an orphan drug candidate, for the treatment of severe preeclampsia in pregnant women. Under the option agreement, at the conclusion of a Phase 2b/3a clinical trial we may exercise, extend or terminate the acquisition option, at which time we have the right to purchase all intellectual property of Velo related to the DIF Rights. 
With regard to pending patent applications we own or have rights to, even though further patents may be issued on such applications, we cannot be sure that any such patents will be issued on a timely basis, if at all, or with a scope that provides our products with additional protection. The claims of issued patents related to any of our products may not provide meaningful protection for the product, and third parties may challenge the validity or scope of any such issued patents. Additionally, the claims of our issued patents may be narrowed or invalidated by administrative proceedings, such as interference or derivation, inter partes review, post grant review or reexamination proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, existing or future patents of third parties may limit our ability to commercialize our products.
We also have numerous U.S. and foreign trademark registrations directed to our corporate and affiliate names, as well as our products, compliance programs and services. These marks help to further distinguish our products and services and enhance our overall intellectual property position.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and cord blood banking industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Makena competition currently comes mainly from pharmacies that compound a non-FDA approved version of Makena, which is sold at a much lower list price and is less regulated than Makena. However, we expect the competitive landscape for Makena to impose even greater challenges upon our commercialization efforts when generic formulations of Makena IM product enter the market, which could happen at any time given the expiration of orphan drug exclusivity in February 2018. Many of our competitors for Feraheme and Intrarosa are large, well-known pharmaceutical companies and may benefit from significantly greater financial, sales and marketing capabilities, greater technological or competitive advantages, and other resources. For the CBR Services, competition in the private cord blood and cord tissue banking business is already intense and is likely to increase as the number of competitors continues to grow given the relatively low barriers to entry. We also expect to face competition for bremelanotide, including from an already FDA-approved product for the treatment of HSDD. Our existing or potential competitors for all our products and services have or may develop products or services that are more widely accepted than ours, are viewed as more safe, effective, convenient or easier to administer, have been on the market longer and have stronger patient/provider loyalty, have been approved for a larger patient population, are less expensive or offer more attractive insurance coverage, discounts, reimbursements, incentives or rebates and may have or receive patent protection that dominates, blocks, makes obsolete or adversely affects our product development or business.

Makena
Makena is currently the only FDA-approved drug indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women pregnant with a single baby who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth. Its largest competitor has historically been compounding pharmacies, which have been manufacturing formulations of HPC, the active ingredient in Makena and commonly referred to as “c17P”, for many years at a lower cost than Makena. The FDA implemented the Drug Quality and Security Act (“DQSA”) in 2013, which amended the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”), with respect to the regulation and monitoring of the manufacturing of compounded drugs. Although the FDA has issued a public statement recommending the use of Makena instead of a compounded drug except when there is a specific medical need (i.e., an allergy) that cannot be met by the approved drug and has stated that when it identifies a pharmacist that compounds regularly or in inordinate amounts of any drug products that are essentially copies of Makena, it intends to take enforcement action as it deems appropriate, doctors continue to prescribe, and compounders continue to manufacture and sell, c17P. Although we continue to educate healthcare professionals and patients about progress made toward expanding coverage of Makena and about the benefits of Makena, certain doctors continue to choose to prescribe non-FDA approved c17P made by pharmacy compounders in lieu of prescribing Makena. 
The Makena IM product no longer has market exclusivity and we expect that going forward, Makena's primary competitors will be generic formulations of HPC injection, which could enter the market through the approval of ANDAs that use Makena as a reference listed drug and allow generic competitors to rely on Makena’s safety and efficacy trials instead of conducting their own studies. We currently believe that several companies filed ANDAs during 2017 seeking approval for generic versions of HPC injection. The specific timing of potential approval of a generic HPC injection ANDA is uncertain, however we believe that Makena could face generic competition by mid-2018. We have partnered with a generics company to launch and market an authorized generic of the Makena IM product to allow us to offset some of the impact of generics to branded Makena, including if a generic enters the market more quickly than we anticipate. If a generic version of Makena becomes available in the market, governmental and payer pressures to reduce pharmaceutical costs may cause physicians to prescribe the generic formulation rather than the branded Makena, and could materially and adversely affect the level of sales and the price at which we could sell Makena.
Following the entry of generic competitors to Makena, the longer-term durability of the Makena franchise will be highly dependent on our ability to successfully commercialize the Makena auto-injector, which was approved by the FDA in February 2018. The Makena auto-injector is intended to provide healthcare professionals and patients with an alternative treatment method to the Makena IM product. We plan to launch the Makena auto-injector in March 2018. Upon the entry of a generic version of Makena to the market, the auto-injector will compete with generic versions of the Makena IM product, including our own authorized generic, discussed above. We have limited experience in the development or commercialization of an auto-injector product and in order to compete with potential generic entrants and retain sufficient Makena revenues, we will need to differentiate our auto-injector product from the IM generic products by successfully executing on the following strategies:

• | Rapidly driving awareness of the availability and benefits of the Makena auto-injector and converting current IM prescribers to the Makena auto-injector;


• | Provide training on the use of the auto-injector to healthcare providers, as well as the benefits of the subcutaneous delivery in light of the obstetrical community's limited experience prescribing and using auto-injectors; and


• | Provide an easy and convenient process for patients and healthcare providers to prescribe, acquire and administer the Makena auto-injector.

In addition, due to the lower cost of the generics, if physicians, patients and payers do not fully appreciate the potential benefits of the Makena auto-injector, payers may require treatment with the generic, which could cause sales of Makena to decline. Further, if healthcare professionals prefer the IM method of administration to the auto-injector method, they will not utilize the auto-injector and we could lose a significant amount of our Makena revenue and market share to the generic competitors. We expect the Makena auto-injector to be priced at parity with the Makena IM product at launch to help ensure timely and affordable access. 
Makena also competes with products that may be prescribed off-label (i.e., outside of indications approved by the FDA) such as the generic version of Delalutin, a product which contains the same active ingredient as Makena, but which was approved for conditions other than reducing the risk of preterm birth and is not therapeutically equivalent to Makena. Further, other companies are or may be working on developing additional formulations or routes of administration for products that reduce or prevent preterm birth. For example, an oral HPC product is currently in development and has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA.

Based on market research we have conducted, we estimate that the following represents the 2017 and 2016 U.S. market share allocation of the Makena at-risk patient population (as calculated by shipments to physicians), including patients treated with Makena, patients treated with c17P, and the patient population being treated either with other therapies, such as vaginal progesterone, that are not approved for women pregnant with a single baby with a prior history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth, or not treated at all. 

 | 2017 | 2016
Makena | 50% | 42% 
c17P | 20% | 28% 
Other therapies or untreated | 30% | 30% 

For a detailed discussion regarding the risks and uncertainties related to competition for Makena, please refer to our Risk Factors, “We no longer have market exclusivity for Makena and generic competitors are seeking approval to market generic versions of Makena, which would cause sales of Makena to significantly decline and have an adverse impact on our business and results of operation.” and “Competition in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries, including from companies marketing generic products, is intense and competition in the cord blood stem cell and cord tissue banking processing and storage business is increasing. If we fail to compete effectively, our business and market position will suffer.” 
CBR Services
In the past ten years, the cord blood banking industry has seen significant change. For example, in 2013 approximately 2.6% of U.S. parents were privately storing cord blood as compared to 2004 when only 0.2% of parents were privately storing cord blood. Similarly, the storage of umbilical cord tissue has grown substantially from when it was first offered to the public as a commercial option in 2010. CBR was the first major company in the U.S. to offer umbilical cord tissue storage in 2010, and in 2017, most private U.S. cord blood banks now offer this service. The relatively low barriers to entry allow competitors to easily enter the market, and some of these competitors offer, or may in the future offer, additional bio-banking services to their customers, such as noninvasive prenatal testing, newborn screening, whole genome sequencing and/or placenta banking services and have more advanced collection kits and storage bags, which could make them more attractive to consumers than CBR. We also face competition from public banks, as families may choose to use public banks over private banks based on considerations such as the higher cost of private banking, the rate that cord blood is used within public banks versus private banks, the altruistic value to society of public banking and the perception that publicly stored cord blood is of a higher quality because private cord blood banks are not subject to the same regulatory oversight as public banks. New entrants to the market could affect our market share or put downward pressure on the pricing of the CBR Services or may offer and promote similar services at lower prices. In addition, new entrants may not abide by industry guidelines, regulations and standards, including quality, compliance and marketing standards and/or engage in marketing behaviors that communicate false or misleading information. In addition to having a potential adverse impact on our business, these behaviors by such competitors could create a negative perception of our industry if they violate regulations or pursue questionable business practices. Though the barriers to entry are low, we believe that establishing a high-quality brand and nationwide reputation like CBR’s, and growing a bank to a size where long-term stability of operations is not a primary concern for customers, gives CBR an advantage in the market.
In the U.S., CBR is considered the largest private cord blood bank based on the number of cord blood and cord tissue units banked, with nearly 40% of the private bank market. CBR’s largest U.S. competitor is ViaCord®, a subsidiary of PerkinElmer, Inc. Two other banks, Cryo-Cell International, Inc.® and StemCyte™, are significantly smaller than either CBR or ViaCord®, but maintain a national footprint. In addition to these three competitors, CBR competes with more than 20 other blood banks in the U.S., most of which have regional focuses. CBR differentiates itself from almost all of its competitors through its size, brand recognition, longevity, investments in research and its commercial reach. 
Feraheme
Feraheme currently competes primarily with the following IV iron replacement therapies for the treatment of IDA:

• | Venofer®, an iron sucrose complex, which is approved for use in hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, non-dialysis dependent CKD patients and pediatric CKD patients and is marketed in the U.S. by Fresenius Medical Care North America and American Regent, Inc. (“American Regent”), a subsidiary of Luitpold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a business unit of Daiichi Sankyo Group);


• | Injectafer®, a ferric carboxymaltose injection, which is approved to treat IDA in adult patients who have intolerance to oral iron or have had unsatisfactory response to oral iron. Injectafer® is also indicated for IDA in adult patients with

17

non-dialysis dependent CKD. Injectafer® is marketed in the U.S. by American Regent, the same distributor of Venofer®; 

• | Ferrlecit®, a sodium ferric gluconate, which is marketed by Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, is approved for use only in hemodialysis patients;


• | A generic version of Ferrlecit® marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and


• | INFeD®, an iron dextran product marketed by Allergan, Inc. which is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with documented iron deficiency in whom oral iron administration is unsatisfactory or impossible.

In addition to the currently marketed products described above, Feraheme may also compete with Auryxia® (ferric citrate), an oral phosphate binder, which is marketed by Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., and which recently received a second indication for the treatment of IDA in adult patients with CKD not on dialysis. Further, Pharmacosmos A/S is developing Monofer® (iron isomaltoside) and has commenced a Phase 3 trial in the U.S. In addition, there are several hypoxia inducible factor stabilizers in various stages of development to treat anemia related to CKD. 
We may face challenges retaining our existing Feraheme customers, gaining sales to new customers and gaining market share despite the February 2018 approval of Feraheme’s broader label. For example, since Injectafer® was approved in 2013 with a broader indication than the original Feraheme indication, physicians may have increased their use of Injectafer® and other physicians may have begun to use Injectafer®, making it more difficult for us to cause these physicians to use Feraheme in the future. In addition, manufacturers of Injectafer® may have entered into commercial contracts with key customers or group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), which would limit our ability to enter into favorable pricing arrangements. Further, Daiichi Sankyo Group has a substantially larger sales force to market Injectafer® than we do to market Feraheme, which allows them to reach a broader group of healthcare professionals.
Companies that manufacture generic products typically invest far fewer resources in research and development than the manufacturers of branded products and can therefore price their products significantly lower than those branded products already on the market. Therefore, competition from generic IV iron products could limit our sales. Feraheme may face future competition from generic IV iron replacement therapy products. For example, as discussed above, in February 2016, we received a Paragraph IV certification notice letter regarding an ANDA submitted to the FDA by Sandoz requesting approval to engage in commercial manufacture, use and sale of a generic version of ferumoxytol. In March 2016, we initiated a patent infringement suit alleging that Sandoz’ ANDA filing itself constituted an act of infringement and that if it is approved, the manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale or importation of Sandoz’ ferumoxytol products would infringe our patents. By the filing of our complaint, we believe the 30 month stay was triggered and that Sandoz is prohibited from marketing its ferumoxytol product, even if it receives conditional approval from the FDA until the earliest of (a) August 5, 2018 (30 months from the date we received Sandoz's a notice of certification), (b) the conclusion of litigation in Sandoz’s favor, or (c) expiration of the patent(s). In May 2016, Sandoz filed a response to our patent infringement suit and the trial is scheduled for March 19, 2018. 
Based on sales data provided to us in January 2018 by IQVIA, we estimate that the size of the total 2017 U.S. non-dialysis IV iron replacement therapy market was approximately 1.2 million grams, which represents an increase of approximately 10% over 2016. During 2017 and 2016, Feraheme competed in the CKD portion of this market, which we estimate is approximately half of the total market. Based on this IQVIA data, the following represents the 2017 and 2016 U.S. market share allocation of the total non-dialysis IV iron market based on the volume of IV iron administered:
 | 2017 U.S. Non-dialysis IV Iron Market | 2016 U.S. Non-dialysis IV Iron Market
 | (1.2 million grams) | (1.1 million grams) 
Venofer® | 35% | 38% 
Injectafer® | 26% | 21% 
INFeD® | 15% | 15% 
Feraheme | 12% | 13% 
Generic sodium ferric gluconate | 9% | 9% 
Ferrlecit® | 3% | 4% 

The market share data listed in the table above is not necessarily indicative of the market shares in dollars due to the variations in selling prices among the IV iron products. 
18

Intrarosa 
Intrarosa faces competition from the following approved products: 

• | Estrace® Cream (Estradiol vaginal cream, USP 0.01%) (“Estrace”), a vaginal cream for the treatment of VVA marketed by Allergan PLC;


• | Estradiol® Vaginal Cream USP, 0.01% (generic version of Estrace®), including a generic marketed by Mylan N.V., which was launched in December 2017, a generic marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., a subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (“Teva”), which was launched in January 2018 and a generic marketed by Perrigo PLC, which was launched in January 2018;


• | Vagifem® (estradiol vaginal inserts) (“Vagifem”), a suppository marketed by Novo Nordisk A/S for the treatment of VVA;


• | Estradiol vaginal inserts USP (generic versions of Vagifem®), including Yuvafem, which was launched in October 2016 and is marketed by Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC and a generic marketed by Teva, which was launched in July 2017;


• | Premarin Vaginal Cream®, a vaginal cream for the treatment of VVA marketed by Pfizer, Inc. (“Pfizer”);


• | Estring®(estradiol vaginal ring), a vaginal ring marketed by Pfizer for the treatment of VVA due to menopause;


• | Osphena®, an oral therapy marketed by Duchesnay Inc. for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia due to menopause; and


• | Over the counter and compounded remedies that are marketed for dyspareunia and over the counter and compounded products that contain DHEA.

The actual market size and market dynamics for moderate to severe dyspareunia due to menopause is uncertain. While we believe that Intrarosa, as the only FDA approved, local non-estrogen-containing drug to treat moderate to severe dyspareunia, has competitive advantages compared to estrogen-containing therapies, we may not be able to realize this perceived advantage in the market. For example, Osphena®, is an oral non-estrogen product, which has a modified boxed warning. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced if physicians or patients perceive that other products are more effective, or convenient or safer than Intrarosa, or if they are less expensive than Intrarosa. 
In addition, our ability to compete may be affected by the extent and scope of third-party reimbursement for products treating dyspareunia. Some of the products that Intrarosa competes with have a broader indication for VVA and receive reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs. Although we have been able to gain coverage for Intrarosa with commercial health plans, given the increasing number of generic competitors, payers may choose to implement step edits or prior authorizations prior to Intrarosa use. Intrarosa is generally classified as a Tier 3 drug, and as a result patients do not receive full reimbursement by third-party commercial payers and do not receive any reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs. Many patients are therefore subject to substantial copays or deductible requirements. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has historically not covered or paid for products to treat sexual dysfunctions, which currently include dyspareunia, under Medicare Part D. As a result, Medicare coverage of Intrarosa has been limited. Less than full reimbursement by governmental and other third-party payers may adversely affect the market acceptance of Intrarosa and put it at a competitive disadvantage to some of the competing products, including generic versions of estrogens and compounded products, which are often priced lower than branded products.
In addition, TherapeuticsMD, Inc. is developing TX-004HR, an applicator-free vaginal estrogen softgel capsule for the treatment of dyspareunia, which has, per the target timeframes in the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), a target action date for completion of the FDA’s review of May 2018 (“PDUFA date”).
MuGard 
There are currently few effective treatments for the treatment or management of oral mucositis. The market for treating oral mucositis is driven primarily by convenience, price and reimbursement and the products in this market remain mostly undifferentiated. There are a number of approaches used to treat or manage oral mucositis that compete with MuGard, including the use of ice chips during chemotherapy treatments, various medicinal mouthwashes, topical anesthetics and 
19

analgesics, and oral gel treatments. For example, many physicians use what is commonly known as “magic mouthwash”, which may currently be the most commonly prescribed medication to manage oral mucositis. Magic mouthwash is a combination of generic ingredients which are typically compounded in a pharmacy and is preferred by many physicians because of the availability of less expensive generic ingredients used to formulate the mouthwash. 
Bremelanotide
If bremelanotide is approved for marketing by the FDA and if we are successful in launching and commercializing it, we expect bremelanotide will face competition. Addyi® (flibanserin) was introduced into the market in October 2015 for the treatment of HSDD in pre-menopausal women and is marketed by Sprout2 Inc. (“Sprout”). Addyi® is only available through a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) program because of an increased risk of severe hypotension and syncope due to the interaction between Addyi® and alcohol. In addition, Addyi® was approved with a boxed warning to highlight the risks of severe hypotension and syncope in patients who drink alcohol during treatment with Addyi®, in patients who use Addyi® with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, or in patients who have liver impairment. 
We are not aware of any company actively developing another melanocortin receptor agonist drug for the treatment of HSDD. However, we are aware of several other drugs at various stages of development, most of which are being developed to be taken on a chronic, typically once-daily, basis. Emotional Brain BV, a Netherlands company, is developing two different oral fixed-dose, on-demand combination drugs, one a combination of sildenafil and testosterone and the other a combination of testosterone and buspirone hydrochloride, and has conducted Phase 2b studies. There may be other companies developing new drugs for FSD indications, some of which may be in clinical trials in the U.S. or elsewhere, or other companies which may sell their products off-label for indications other than FSD. 
While we believe that bremelanotide will have competitive advantages for treating HSDD, such as desired use and length of the therapeutic effect compared to chronic or daily use hormones and other drugs, we may not be able to realize these perceived advantages in the market, in part because bremelanotide is administered by subcutaneous auto-injection. While the single-use, disposable auto-injector format is designed to maximize market acceptability, apprehension associated with an injectable drug or certain side effects that were observed in the Phase 3 studies, such as nausea, may impact bremelanotide’s ability to achieve significant market acceptance, especially if an oral therapy is available as an alternative.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Makena
We currently have sales representatives dedicated exclusively to Makena and the CBR Services, who are focused on calling on approximately 16,000 obstetricians and maternal fetal medicine specialists in the U.S. Makena prescriptions are dispensed via the payer-preferred pharmacy or purchased directly by hospitals, government agencies and integrated delivery systems.
Based on market research we conducted, we estimate that Makena is currently used to treat approximately 50% of the at-risk patient population. Our sales and marketing teams use a variety of strategies and focused, multi-channel methods to promote Makena, including dedicating a managed care team to focus on health plans, including commercial payers, pharmacy benefit managers, and managed Medicaid plans as well as fee-for-service Medicaid programs. In addition, we have partnered with a leading provider of home nursing services (which had previously utilized compounded HPC) pursuant to which the provider performs at-home administration of Makena and co-promotes Makena to certain healthcare providers. 
In addition, we offer customer support through the Makena Care Connection, which is designed to help the prescriber and patient navigate each individual patient’s needs throughout the Makena prescription process, including confirming insurance coverage, providing education and support on prior authorizations (when applicable), and working in collaboration with a payer-preferred pharmacy and home health agency to help ensure timely initiation of therapy. The Makena Care Connection also screens eligible patients for and enrolls eligible patients in financial assistance programs including (a) our copay savings program, which helps lower the out-of-pocket cost for commercially insured patients whose plan covers Makena, and (b) our patient assistance program, which provides a full course of therapy at no cost to eligible uninsured and commercially underinsured patients. Additionally, the Makena Care Connection offers education and adherence support to eligible patients to assist with increasing patient compliance by encouraging adherence to the weekly Makena injection schedule. 
20

CBR Services
In addition to calling on physicians, we directly market CBR Services to pregnant women and their families through various digital marketing channels, including social media, email and web properties, and believe that we have the potential to reach approximately two million pregnant women each year, representing approximately half of the pregnancies in the U.S. The CBR consumer sales team educates expectant parents on their cord blood banking options and the benefits of preserving their newborn’s stem cells. This team of inside sales representatives uses both telephone and online chat to interact with consumers and potential customers and is central to CBR’s direct-to-consumer approach that is coordinated with our digital marketing lead generation and qualification expertise and with detailing efforts by our women's health field force. Additionally, we nurture and develop customer referrals from an existing base of over 385,000 families through our customer service team and digital and social media marketing efforts.
We also offer the Newborn Possibilities Program®, which provides free processing and five years of free storage for cord blood and cord tissue to families with a qualifying medical need. To date, approximately 8,000 families have been enrolled. Further, the Newborn Possibilities Program has been expanded with the launch of the first registry aimed at collecting family health data on diseases and conditions common among registry participants to help target medical research on those that may be treatable with newborn stem cell therapy. Currently, over 145,000 families are participating in the Family Health Registry™. 
Feraheme
We sell Feraheme to authorized wholesalers and specialty distributors who, in turn, sell Feraheme to healthcare providers who administer Feraheme primarily within hospitals, hematology and oncology centers and nephrology clinics. Since many hospitals and hematology, oncology and nephrology practices are members of GPOs, which leverage the purchasing power of a group of entities to obtain discounts based on the collective bargaining power of the group, we also routinely enter into pricing agreements with GPOs in these markets so the members of the GPOs have access to Feraheme and to the related discounts or rebates. 
Our sales and marketing organization uses a variety of common pharmaceutical marketing strategies and methods to promote Feraheme, including sales calls to purchasing entities, such as hospitals, hematology and oncology centers and nephrology practices, in addition to individual physicians or other healthcare professionals, medical education symposia, personal and non-personal promotional materials, local and national educational programs, and scientific meetings and conferences. In addition, through AMAG AssistTM, we provide customer service and other related programs for Feraheme including financial and prescription support services, a patient assistance program for eligible uninsured or under-insured patients and a customer service call center. 
The recent label expansion for Feraheme to include all eligible IDA patients in the U.S. doubles the size of the addressable patient population for Feraheme. We believe this expanded label will allow for increased penetration in existing accounts thereby increasing the likelihood of broadening the number of customers utilizing Feraheme within the IV iron marketplace. Additionally, with the expanded label, Feraheme may be promoted as an option for patients who have intolerance to oral iron or have unsatisfactory response to oral iron therapy that are in treatment settings where we already have sales teams, such as obstetricians and gynecologists. We believe this segment of patients is under-diagnosed and under-treated and there is a significant opportunity in this market to provide IV iron to such patients. Our sales team will work to educate healthcare providers who manage IDA patients to expand the IV iron use in physicians’ offices, clinics, and hospitals where IDA patients are treated. 
Intrarosa
In July 2017, Intrarosa became available for healthcare provider prescribing and can be ordered through wholesalers and retail pharmacies. As part of our launch strategy, and critical to the commercial success of Intrarosa, we are executing on an integrated marketing plan designed to drive awareness of dyspareunia and the potential benefits of Intrarosa to increase the likelihood that healthcare providers and patients will view Intrarosa as an accessible and viable treatment option. Despite significant marketing and educational efforts by industry participants intended to spread awareness of the condition and its treatment, studies suggest that women often do not recognize dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, as a treatable medical condition and are often not aware of treatment options. We have and plan to continue to undertake informational and educational programs such as speaker programs to help spread awareness of dyspareunia and VVA and the benefits of Intrarosa for the conditions indicated. In addition, we have implemented a sampling program, which makes samples of Intrarosa available to healthcare providers through our sales representatives or via our website to areas where we do not have sales representatives. We also currently offer a comprehensive copay savings program to patients and are developing patient-specific marketing programs around the condition of dyspareunia and Intrarosa utilizing digital marketing and social media platforms. 
21

MuGard
Our commercial team uses a variety of common pharmaceutical marketing strategies and methods to promote MuGard, including sales calls to providing entities, such as hematology and oncology centers and hospitals. In addition, other marketing programs may include promotional materials to individual physicians or other healthcare professionals.
We market and sell MuGard to wholesalers and specialty pharmacies. Patients primarily receive MuGard through specialty pharmacies, which receive prescriptions from physicians directly or from AMAG Assist, which acts as our MuGard patient reimbursement and support center. We utilize AMAG Assist as a centralized patient intake and referral management center to process insurance coverage issues and administer our patient assistance program. In order to make MuGard available to patients as soon as possible, we provide a starter kit to clinicians, including a sample bottle and all pertinent information that the patient or caregiver needs to immediately begin MuGard therapy.
Product Supply Chain
We outsource a number of our product supply chain services for our products to third-party logistics providers, including services related to warehousing and inventory management, distribution, chargeback processing, accounts receivable management, sample distribution to our sales force and customer service call center management.
Major Customers
The following table sets forth customers who represented 10% or more of our total revenues for 2017, 2016 and 2015. Revenues from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”), our former partner for the commercialization of Feraheme outside of the U.S., included payments under the license, development and commercialization agreement with Takeda, including in connection with its termination in 2015. 

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation | 21 | % | | 22 | % | 25 | %
McKesson Corporation | 19 | % | | 11 | % | 12 | %
Takeda Pharmaceuticals Company Limited | — | % | | — | % | 11 | %

The loss of the above customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.
Government Regulation 
Overview
Our activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. The FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research and development, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, recordkeeping, approval, storage, distribution, and advertising, promotion and post-approval monitoring and reporting of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. In addition, under the Public Health Service Act and its implementing regulations, we are required to register our cord blood and cord tissue banking facility with the FDA, which governs all aspects of cord blood preservation, including the recovery, screening, testing, processing, storage, labeling, packaging and distribution of cord blood stem cells. 
Failure to comply with any of the applicable U.S. requirements may result in a variety of administrative or judicially imposed sanctions including, among other things, the regulatory agency’s refusal to approve pending applications, suspension, variations or withdrawals of approval, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, or criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical Product Approval Process
Clinical Development
Before we may market a new drug product, we must obtain FDA approval of an NDA for that product. The FDA may approve an NDA if, among other requirements, the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate can be established based on the results of preclinical and clinical studies.
22

Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practice regulations. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCPs”), which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical testing. Prior to beginning a clinical trial, an IND - a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug to humans in clinical trials - must be submitted to FDA and must become effective. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s institutional review board (“IRB”), before any trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the trial until completed. Additional ongoing regulatory requirements apply throughout the course of a clinical trial, including requirements governing the reporting of certain ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
Clinical testing typically proceeds in three phases, which may overlap or be combined. Phase 1 trials seek to collect initial data about safety, tolerability, and optimal dosing of the investigational product in healthy human subjects or, less commonly, in patients with the target disease or condition. The goal of Phase 2 trials is to provide preliminary evidence about the desired therapeutic efficacy of the investigational product in limited studies with small numbers of carefully selected subjects with the target disease or condition. Phase 3 trials generally consist of expanded, large-scale, randomized, double-blind, multi-center studies of the safety and efficacy of the product in the target patient population and are used as the primary basis for regulatory approval. 
Submission and FDA Review of NDAs and sNDAs
Following the successful completion of clinical trials, the sponsor submits the results to the FDA as part of an NDA. The NDA must also include the results of preclinical tests and studies, as the FDA requires submission of all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as, among other required information, information related to the preparation and manufacturing of the drug candidate, analytical methods, and proposed packaging and labeling. Pursuant to agreements reached during reauthorization of PDUFA, the FDA has a goal of acting on most original NDAs within six months or ten months of the application submission or filing date (the FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing), depending on the nature of the drug. The FDA has a number of programs intended to help expedite testing, review, and approval of drug candidates that meet the applicable eligibility criteria. For example, under the provisions of the FDA’s Subpart H Accelerated Approval regulations, accelerated approval may be permitted based on an appropriate surrogate endpoint for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that provides a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments.
If the FDA’s evaluations of the NDA and of the sponsor’s manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will issue an approval letter, and the sponsor may begin marketing the drug for the approved indications, subject to any post-approval requirements, described further below. If the FDA determines it cannot approve the NDA in its current form, it will issue a complete response letter indicating that the application will not be approved in its current form. The complete response letter usually describes the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the application and may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to obtain approval of the NDA. Addressing the deficiencies noted by the FDA could be impractical, and it is possible that the sponsor could withdraw its application or approval may not be obtained or may be costly and may result in significant delays prior to approval.
Where a sponsor wishes to expand the originally approved prescribing information, such as adding a new indication, it must submit and obtain approval of an sNDA. Changes to an indication generally require additional clinical studies, which can be time-consuming and require the expenditure of substantial additional resources. Under PDUFA, the target timeframe for the review of an sNDA to add a new clinical indication is six or ten months from the receipt date, depending on whether or not the sNDA has priority review. As with an NDA, if the FDA determines that it cannot approve an sNDA in its current form, it will issue a complete response letter as discussed above. 
Abbreviated New Drug Application
An ANDA is filed when approval is sought to market a generic equivalent of a drug product previously approved under an NDA and listed in the Orange Book. Rather than directly demonstrating the product’s safety and efficacy, as is required of an NDA, an ANDA must show that the proposed generic product is the same as the previously approved product in terms of active ingredient(s), strength, dosage form and route of administration. In addition, with certain exceptions, the generic product must have the same labeling as the product to which it refers. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is 
23

“bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved product if, in relevant part, “the rate and extent of absorption of the [generic] drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.”
NDA applicants and holders must provide certain information about patents related to the branded drug for listing in the Orange Book. When an ANDA application is submitted, it must contain one of several possible certifications regarding each of the patents listed in the Orange Book for the branded product that is the reference listed drug. A certification that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the sale of the proposed product is called a Paragraph IV certification. See above under “Feraheme - Overview - Paragraph IV certification” for additional details on a Paragraph IV certification notice letter regarding an ANDA submitted to the FDA by Sandoz. 
If the applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send appropriate notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders within 20 days of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application (a marketing application in which sponsors may rely on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted) being accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of expiration of the patent, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant, or 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice (which can be extended if the reference product has 5-year exclusivity and the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is submitted between four and five years after approval of the reference product).
Adverse Event Reporting
The FDA requires a sponsor to submit reports of certain information on side effects and adverse events associated with its products that occur either during clinical trials or after marketing approval. These requirements include specific and timely notification of certain serious, unexpected and/or frequent adverse events, as well as regular periodic reports summarizing adverse drug experiences. Failure to comply with these FDA safety reporting requirements may result in FDA regulatory action that may include civil action or criminal penalties. In addition, as a result of these reports, the FDA could create a Tracked Safety Issue for a product in the FDA’s Document Archiving, Reporting and Regulatory Tracking System, place additional limitations on an approved product’s use, such as through labeling changes, or, potentially, could require withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market. In addition, FDA could require post-approval studies or impose distribution and use restrictions and other requirements via a REMS based upon new safety information obtained through adverse event reporting (discussed further below).
FDA Post-Approval Requirements
Even if initial approval of an NDA or sNDA is granted, such approval may be subject to post-approval regulatory requirements, any or all of which may adversely impact a sponsor’s ability to effectively market and sell the approved product. The FDA may require the sponsor to conduct Phase 4 clinical trials, also known as post-marketing requirements, to provide additional information on safety and efficacy. In addition, the FDA and the sponsor may agree to the conduct of certain post-market studies, known as post-marketing commitments, to further obtain safety and efficacy information. The results of such post-marketing requirement or commitment studies may be negative and could lead to limitations on the further marketing of a product, including safety labeling changes. Also, under PREA, the FDA may require pediatric assessment of certain drugs unless waived or deferred due to the fact that necessary studies are impossible or highly impractical to conduct in the specified age group or where the drug is not likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients in that age group. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to implement a REMS, which may include distribution or use restrictions to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with the product. Failure to comply with REMS requirements may result in civil penalties. Further, if an approved product encounters any safety or efficacy issues, including drug interaction problems, the FDA has broad authority to require the sponsor to take any number of actions, including but not limited to, undertaking post-approval clinical studies, implementing labeling changes, adopting a REMS, issuing Dear Health Care Provider letters, or removing the product from the market.
FDA Regulation of our Products and Services
FDA Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion
The FDA also regulates all advertising and promotional activities for prescription drugs, both prior to and after approval. Approved drug products must be promoted in a manner consistent with their terms and conditions of approval, including the 
24

scope of their approved use. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product (“off-label promotion”) or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements could lead to, among other things, adverse publicity, product seizures, civil or criminal penalties, or regulatory letters, which may include warnings and require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals.
Under the Subpart H regulations, until the Makena confirmatory post-approval clinical trial is completed, we are subject to the requirement that all promotional materials be submitted for review to the FDA’s Office of Promotional Drug Products at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination of the promotional labeling or initial publication of the advertisement. This extra requirement means that there is a longer lead time before we are able to introduce new promotional material to the market for Makena and we are subject to increased scrutiny prior to using promotional pieces to ensure fair balance.
FDA Regulation of Manufacturing Facilities 
Manufacturing procedures and quality control for approved drugs must conform to cGMP. Domestic manufacturing establishments must follow cGMP at all times, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA in order to assess, among other things, cGMP compliance. In addition, prior to approval of an NDA or sNDA, the FDA will often perform a pre-approval inspection of the sponsor’s manufacturing facility, including its equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes, to determine the facility’s compliance with cGMP and other rules and regulations. Vendors that supply finished products or components to the sponsor that are used to manufacture, package, and label products are subject to similar regulation and periodic inspections. If the FDA identifies deficiencies during an inspection, it may issue a formal notice, which may be followed by a warning letter if observations are not addressed satisfactorily. FDA guidelines specify that a warning letter should be issued for violations of “regulatory significance” for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may result in agency consideration of an enforcement action. 
Product approval may be delayed or denied due to cGMP non-compliance or other issues at the sponsor’s manufacturing facilities or contractor sites or suppliers included in the NDA or sNDA, and the complete resolution of these inspectional findings may be beyond the sponsor’s control. If the FDA determines that the sponsor’s equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against the sponsor, including suspension of its manufacturing operations.
Orphan Drug Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined, in part, as a patient population of fewer than 200,000. The company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for the specified rare disease or condition receives orphan drug marketing exclusivity for that drug for a period of seven years. This orphan drug exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving another application for the same drug for the same orphan indication during the exclusivity period, except in very limited circumstances. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity for an approved indication if that indication is for the treatment of a condition broader than that for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity marketing rights may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Finally, the FDA may approve a subsequent drug that is otherwise the same as a currently approved orphan drug for the same orphan indication during the exclusivity period if the sponsor of the subsequent drug can demonstrate that the drug is clinically superior to the already approved drug. According to the FDA, clinical superiority may be demonstrated by showing that a drug is more effective in a clinical trial, safer in a substantial portion of the target population, or provides a major contribution to patient care relative to the currently approved drug. 
Drug Quality and Security Act
In November 2013, the DQSA legislation was enacted to amend the FDC Act with respect to the regulation and monitoring of the manufacturing of compounded drugs. Among other provisions of the DQSA, compounding pharmacies may now elect to register as an “outsourcing facility” under FDC Act Section 503B. Registration as an outsourcing facility requires that drugs be compounded according to cGMP standards; that facilities report adverse events to the FDA; and that facilities be subject to a risk-based inspection schedule, among other requirements. Additionally, FDC Act Section 503A describes the conditions that must be satisfied for drug products compounded by a licensed pharmacist or licensed physician to be exempt from approval, labeling, and cGMP requirements. To qualify for these exemptions, a compounded drug product must, among other things, be compounded for an identified patient based on a valid prescription or in limited quantities before the receipt of a prescription 
25

for such individual patient in certain circumstances. Under both Sections 503A and 503B of the FDC Act, compounding pharmacies may not compound regularly or in inordinate amounts any drug products that are “essentially copies of commercially available drug products.” 
Fraud and Abuse Regulation
Our general operations, and the research, development, manufacture, sale, and marketing of our products, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, including but not limited to FDA regulations, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), the Federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and their state analogues, and similar laws in countries outside of the U.S., laws governing sampling and distribution of products and government price reporting laws.

• | The AKS makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug or medical device manufacturer, to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for, or to intended to induce, purchasing, ordering, arranging for, or recommending the purchase or order of any item or service, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program. Liability may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, federal law now provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA, described below. Violations of the AKS carry potentially significant civil and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines, administrative civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Many states have enacted similar anti-kickback laws, including in laws that prohibit paying or receiving remuneration to induce a referral or recommendation of an item or service reimbursed by any payer, including private payers.


• | The FCA imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement of drugs or services for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The FCA also prohibits knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or having possession, custody, or control of property or money used, or to be used, by the federal government and knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered, less than all of that money or property. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the FCA. The FCA permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring an action on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. Government enforcement agencies and private whistleblowers have asserted liability under the FCA for, among other things, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or for medically unnecessary items or services, kickbacks, promotion of off-label uses, and misreporting of drug prices to federal agencies. Many states have enacted similar false claims laws, including in some cases laws that apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer, not just government programs.


• | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (“HIPAA”) as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, which imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers, or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.


• | The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “ACA”), which imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.

26


• | The FCPA prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment.

Our activities are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities including CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Federal and state authorities continue to devote significant attention and resources to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in bringing lawsuits on behalf of the government under the FCA. We have developed and implemented a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are current best practices in the pharmaceutical industry; however, these laws are broad in scope and there may not be regulations, guidance, or court decisions that definitively interpret these laws in the context of particular industry practices. We cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants, or our contractors are or will be in compliance will all federal, state, and foreign regulations. If we or our representatives fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations, a range of fines, penalties, and/or other sanctions could be imposed on us, including, but not limited to, restrictions on how we market and sell our products, significant fines, exclusions from government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, litigation, or other sanctions. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such investigations or suits may also result in related shareholder lawsuits, which can also have an adverse effect on our business.
Other Regulatory Requirements
Several states have enacted legislation requiring manufacturers operating within the state to establish marketing and promotional compliance programs or codes of conduct and/or file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities. In addition, as part of the ACA manufacturers of drugs and medical devices are required to publicly report gifts and other payments or transfers of value made to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals. Several states have also adopted laws that prohibit certain marketing-related activities, including the provision of gifts, meals or other items to certain healthcare providers. Many of these requirements are new and uncertain, and the likely extent of future enforcement for failure to comply with these requirements is unclear. However, compliance with these laws is difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws, we may face enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties, and we could receive adverse publicity which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We are also subject to data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (i.e., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. HIPAA imposes, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA (other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits) we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. We are also subject to laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. We obtain patient health information from most healthcare providers who prescribe our products and research institutions we collaborate with, and they are subject to privacy and security requirements that may affect us. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy rights or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. For example, through April 29, 2033, CBR is required to comply with a FTC Order (the “FTC Order”). The FTC Order requires CBR, among other things, to implement and maintain a comprehensive information security program and conduct a biennial assessment of its information security program. CBR is also required not 
27

to make any misrepresentations, expressly or by implication, regarding its privacy practices or its information security program. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, these obligations are substantial and may impede our performance and our ability to develop the CBR Services, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance.
U. S. Healthcare Reform
Our revenue and operations could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy in the U.S. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to health care availability, the method of delivery or payment for health care products and services could negatively impact our business, operations and financial condition. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. For example, the ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Since its enactment, however, there have been modifications and challenges to numerous aspects of the ACA. In 2018, litigation, regulation, and legislation related to the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. The full impact of the ACA, any law repealing. replacing, and/or modifying elements of it, and the political uncertainty surrounding any repeal or replacement legislation on our business remains unclear.
Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid healthcare costs. Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Regulation of Cord Blood and Cord Tissue Banking
Human tissues intended for transplantation, including umbilical cord blood stem cells and cord tissue, are subject to comprehensive regulations that address activities associated with human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products (“HCT/Ps”). One set of regulations requires that companies that engage in the recovery, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, or distribution of any HCT/Ps, or the screening or testing of a cell or tissue donor, register with the FDA. This set of regulations also includes the criteria that must be met in order for the HCT/P to be eligible for distribution solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (the “PHSA”), and the regulations in 21 CFR Part 1271, rather than under the drug or device provisions of the FDC Act or the biological product licensing provisions of the PHSA. Another set of regulations provides criteria that must be met for donors to be eligible to donate HCT/Ps and is referred to as the “Donor Eligibility” rule. A third set of provisions governs the processing and distribution of the tissues and is often referred to as the “Current Good Tissue Practices” rule. The Current Good Tissue Practices rule covers all stages of HCT/P processing, from procurement to distribution of final allografts. Together these regulations are designed to ensure that sound, high quality practices are followed to reduce the risk of tissue contamination and of communicable disease transmission to recipients. 
CBR is registered with the FDA as an HCT/P establishment that screens, packages, processes, stores, labels and distributes umbilical cord blood stem cell and cord tissue by virtue of the services it provides to expectant parents as a private cord blood and cord tissue bank. The FDA periodically inspects such registered establishments to determine compliance with HCT/P requirements. If the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, or any future regulatory requirements or standards, it can impose or initiate a variety of enforcement actions, including but not limited to, public warning or untitled letters, written recall or destruction orders, written cease manufacturing orders, court-ordered seizures, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, or criminal prosecutions. 
Some states impose additional regulation and oversight of cord blood and cord tissue banks and of clinical laboratories operating within their borders and impose regulatory compliance obligations on out-of-state laboratories providing services to their residents, and many states in which we and our business partners operate have licensing requirements that must be complied with. 
28

Drug-Device Combination Regulation
Combination products are defined by the FDA to include products composed of two or more regulated components (e.g., a drug and a device). Drugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. The Makena auto-injector and the bremelanotide product, if approved, are considered drug-device combination products and are regulated under this framework. 
Medical Device Regulation
Medical devices, such as MuGard, are similarly subject to FDA clearance or approval and extensive post-approval regulation under the FDC Act. Authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device in the U.S. is generally received in one of two ways. The first, known as premarket notification (the “510(k) process”), requires a sponsor to obtain 510(k) clearance by demonstrating that the new medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device that is not subject to premarket approval. The second, more rigorous process, known as premarket approval, requires a sponsor to independently demonstrate that the new medical device is safe and effective.
Both before and after a device is commercially released, there are ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. For example, the FDA requires that device manufacturers maintain particular reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could, depending on the FDA’s specific findings, require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, or ban such medical devices. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions, enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us.
MuGard received 510(k) clearance from the FDA in 2006 and under the terms of the MuGard License Agreement, Abeona continues to hold the 510(k). MuGard is categorized as a pre-amendments device. This type of device has not been classified under the classification processes applicable to pre-amendments devices, but continues to be subject to regulatory review under the 510(k) premarket clearance process.
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
Our ability to successfully commercialize our products is dependent, in significant part, on the availability and level of reimbursement from third-party payers, including state and federal government, managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations.
Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical products (including combination products), and continue to institute cost containment measures to control or influence the purchase of pharmaceutical products. The determination of coverage for a product may be a separate process from setting the price or reimbursement rate that a payer will pay for a product. Payers may place restrictions on coverage through various mechanisms, including: (a) formularies, which limit coverage for drugs not included on a predetermined list; (b) variable copayments, which may make a certain drug more expensive for patients as compared with a competing drug; (c) utilization management controls, such as requirements for prior authorization before the payer will cover the drug and limits on the number of prescriptions that will be paid over a set time period; (d) restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs; and (e) other coverage policies that limit access to certain drugs for certain uses based on the payer-specific coverage policy. Reimbursement by payers depends on a number of factors, including determination that the product is competitively priced, safe and effective, appropriate for the specific patient, and cost-effective.
Medicaid is a joint federal and state health insurance program that is administered by the states for low-income children, families, pregnant women, and people with disabilities. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program. The amount of the rebate is determined by law and will be adjusted upward if average manufacture price (“AMP”) increases more than inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index - Urban. Each quarter, the rebate amount is calculated based on our report of current AMP and best price for each of our products to CMS. The requirements for calculating AMP and best price are complex. We are required to report revisions to AMP or best price previously reported within a certain period, which revisions could affect our rebate liability for prior quarters. Further, recent changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, effective April of 2016, require state Medicaid programs to reimburse certain 
29

brand name covered outpatient drugs at actual acquisition cost plus a dispensing fee. If we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the statute governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate program provides for civil monetary penalties.
Medicare is a federal health insurance program, administered by CMS, for people who are 65 or older, and certain people with disabilities or certain conditions, irrespective of their age. Medicare Part B covers products that are administered by physicians or other healthcare practitioners; are provided in connection certain durable medical equipment; or are certain oral anti-cancer drugs and certain oral immunosuppressive drugs. We are required to provide average sales price (“ASP”) information to CMS on a quarterly basis. The submitted information is used to calculate a Medicare payment rate using ASP plus a specified percentage. These rates are adjusted periodically. If we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the governing statutes provides for civil monetary penalties.
Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e. drugs that do not need to be injected or otherwise administered by a physician), including combination products. Medicare Part D is a voluntary prescription drug benefit, administered by private prescription drug plan sponsors approved by the U.S. government. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs; and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time to time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with the manufacturers and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer discounts. Manufacturers, including us, are required to provide a 50% discount on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits.
Effective January 2018, CMS adopted a policy to pay for separately payable, non-pass-through drugs and biologicals other than vaccines purchased through the 340B Drug Pricing Program under the Public Health Services Act (the “340B Program”), with certain exceptions, at the ASP minus 22.5% rather than ASP plus 6%. Drugs not purchased under the 340B Program will continue to be paid for at a rate of ASP plus 6%. The effect of this change is on the overall 340B Program is unclear. However, there will be significant increases in budget pressure, which may adversely impact premium priced agents, such as Feraheme and Makena. 
Our products are available for purchase by authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”), pursuant to a contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), in which we are required to offer deeply discounted pricing to four federal agencies: VA; Department of Defense (“DOD”); the Coast Guard; and Public Health Services (“PHS”) (including the Indian Health Service) (together the “Big Four”). Coverage under Medicaid, Medicare and the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program is conditioned upon FSS participation. FSS pricing is not to exceed the price we charge our most-favored non-federal customer for a product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Big Four (including products purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), are subject to a cap on pricing equal to 76% of the non-federal average manufacturer price (non-FAMP). An additional discount applies if non-FAMP increases more than inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index - Urban. If we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information, the governing statute provides for civil monetary penalties.
Federal law requires that any company participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B Program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B Program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on AMP and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. In addition, we may, but are not required to, offer these covered entities a price lower than the 340B ceiling price. The ACA also obligates the Health Resources and Services Administration (the “HRSA”), the agency which administers the 340B Program, to promulgate various regulations and implement processes to improve the integrity of the 340B Program. The status of new and pending regulations and guidance is uncertain under the new presidential administration and its impact.
Federal, state and local governments continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs and combination products. In 2017, we saw several states and local government either implement or consider implementing price transparency legislation that may prevent or limit our ability to take price increases at certain rates or frequencies. For example, in 2017, California enacted a new law, that went into effect on January 1, 2018, to facilitate greater transparency in brand-name and generic drug pricing through the implementation of specific price reporting requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturers. The extent and timing of these changes are not known, but future legislation could limit the price and/or payment for prescription drugs. If adequate reimbursement levels are not maintained by 
30

government and other third-party payers for our products, our ability to sell our products may be limited and/or our ability to establish acceptable pricing levels may be impaired, thereby reducing anticipated revenues and profitability.
Backlog
We had a $7.6 million and $7.1 million product sales backlog as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect to recognize the $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, net of any applicable rebates or credits. These backlogs were largely due to timing of orders received from our third-party logistics providers. Generally, product orders from our customers are fulfilled within a relatively short time of receipt of a customer order.
Employees
As of February 23, 2018, we had 762 employees. We also utilize consultants and independent contractors on a regular basis to assist in the development and commercialization of our products and services. Our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified sales, technical and laboratory operations, managerial, scientific and medical personnel of all levels. Although we believe we have been relatively successful to date in obtaining and retaining such personnel, we may not be successful in the future. 
None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Foreign Operations
We have no foreign operations. We did not have material revenues from customers outside of the U.S. in 2017 and 2016. Revenues from customers outside of the U.S. amounted to approximately 12% of our total revenues for 2015 and were principally related to collaboration revenues recognized in connection with our former agreement with Takeda, which is headquartered in Japan, and which was terminated in June 2015 following a six-month transition period. We do not currently expect any material future sales outside of the U.S. 
Research and Development
We have dedicated a significant portion of our resources over the last several years to our efforts to develop our products and product candidates, including both Feraheme and Makena. We incurred research and development expenses of $75.0 million, $66.1 million, and $42.9 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to the preparation of filing the NDA for bremelanotide and post-approval commitments for Feraheme and Makena. We also expect to invest in studies that could potentially expand the labels for Intrarosa and bremelanotide. Further, we expect to incur increased costs associated with manufacturing process development and the manufacture of drug product for bremelanotide.
Segment Reporting
We conduct our operations in one business segment as further described in Note B, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
