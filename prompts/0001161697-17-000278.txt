Item 1.      BUSINESS.
Company Overview

Overview 

As of the June 6, 2017, we have not established any business operations and have not achieved any revenues. We are currently in the process of identifying and evaluating feasible business opportunities in the consumer products and technology industries. Importantly, there is no guarantee that we will succeed in accomplishing these goals. We have taken no steps to secure the additional financing that we will need to implement our business plan.

We were incorporated in the State of Florida on April 8, 2013, as a for-profit company with a fiscal year end of April 30. 

We have not accomplished any of our intended efforts to date. We have not generated any revenues to date and our activities have been limited to organizational matters, the preparation of our business plan, and the preparation of the financial statements and other information presented in the Prospectus. Our ability to establish operations is entirely dependent on our ability to raise sufficient financing to execute our business plan, however there is no guarantee that we will be successful in this regard. Furthermore, if we successfully establish operations, there is no guarantee that there will be significant market for our services or that we will achieve significant revenues, if at all. 

We believe that we are not a blank check company subject to the provisions of Section (a)(2) of Rule 419 under the Securities Act of 1933 and pursuant to the guidelines specified in Securities Act Release No. 6932 (April 13, 1992) 1992 WL 81275. Section (a)(2) of Rule 419 defines a blank check company as a company that is issuing penny stock and that is “a development stage company that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies, or other entity. “In the adopting release the Commission stated that would “scrutinize registered offerings for attempts to create the appearance that the registrant is not a development stage company or has a specific business plan, in an effort to avoid the application of Rule 419.” See id. At*2. The provisions of that Release discuss Rule 419 provisions which specify that a” blank check company” means a development stage company that either has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies and is issuing “penny stock” as defined in Rule 3a51-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

 Envoy Group Corp. does not have a specific business plan. We are a development stage company with limited operating history. We are relying on the provisions of the above release, which specify that start-up companies with specific business plans are not subject to the provisions of Rule 419, even if operations have not commenced at the time of the offering. The company, its officer and director’s, any promoters and any affiliates have no intention for the company to be used as a vehicle for a private company to become a reporting company.

Management

Our Chairman and CEO has been a founder, CEO and board member of several public companies and brings 31 years of entrepreneurial, operational and capital market experience to Envoy Group. His unique ability of bringing capital to early stage projects will be a benefit to advancing the business objectives of the Company.

We do not currently have any agreements in place with customers for the provision of our services, or any suppliers.
