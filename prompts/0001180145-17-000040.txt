Business Overview
We are a medical technology company leading the way in the effort to successfully treat patients suffering from peripheral and coronary artery diseases, including those with arterial calcium, the most difficult arterial disease to treat. We are committed to clinical rigor, constant innovation and a defining drive to set the industry standard to deliver safe and effective medical devices that improve lives of patients facing this difficult disease state.
We have developed a patented orbital atherectomy technology for both peripheral and coronary commercial applications. Our systems are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of vessel sizes and plaque types, including calcified plaque, and address many of the limitations associated with other treatment alternatives. We refer to the Diamondback 360® Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy Systems (“OAS”) (“Diamondback 360 Peripheral”), the Stealth 360® OAS (“Stealth 360”), and the products included in the chart below collectively in this annual report on Form 10-K as the “Peripheral OAS.”

(1) We are not currently marketing this product. 

As of June 30, 2017, over 292,000 of our Peripheral OAS have been sold to leading institutions across the United States. Sales of Peripheral OAS during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 represented 69% of revenue.
Our coronary product, the Diamondback 360® Coronary OAS (“Coronary OAS”), is a catheter-based platform designed to facilitate stent delivery in patients with coronary artery disease (“CAD”) who are acceptable candidates for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or stenting due to de novo, severely calcified coronary artery lesions. The Coronary OAS design is similar to technology used in our Peripheral OAS, customized specifically for the coronary application. In October 2013, we received premarket approval (“PMA”) from the FDA to market the Coronary OAS as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries. We commenced a commercial launch that same month and, as of June 30, 2017, over 31,000 Coronary OAS have been sold to leading institutions across the United States. Sales of Coronary OAS during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 represented approximately 23% of revenue. In March 2017, the Company received approval from the FDA to market its Diamondback360® Coronary OAS Micro Crown, which is the only atherectomy device designed to both pilot tight, calcific lesions and treat 2.5 to 4mm vessels with a single device. We are planning a limited release of the Coronary OAS Micro Crown in the U.S. in fiscal 2018.

In addition to the Peripheral and Coronary OAS, we offer multiple accessory products required for use with the Peripheral and Coronary OAS. Sales of accessory products, primarily guide wires, represented 8% of revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. 
In November 2016, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Medikit Co., Ltd. to sell the Diamondback 360® Coronary OAS Micro Crown in Japan. In March 2017, we received approval from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (“MHLW”) of our Diamondback 360® Coronary OAS Micro Crown. Pending reimbursement approval, Japan will become the first international market for any CSI product and represents a significant milestone for us. 
We will continue to evaluate options for additional international markets to expand the coronary and peripheral opportunities. 
Market Overview
Peripheral Artery Disease (“PAD”)
Peripheral artery disease is widespread and can be life threatening. The disease is characterized by narrowed, hardened arteries in the legs, limiting blood flow to the legs and feet. If left untreated, PAD may continue to progress to Critical Limb Ischemia (“CLI”), a condition in which the amount of oxygenated blood being delivered to the limb is insufficient to keep the tissue alive. CLI may lead to non-healing ulcers, infections, gangrene, limb amputation or death. According to estimates by the American Heart Association (“AHA”), as many as 8 to 12 million Americans have PAD. An aging population, coupled with increasing incidence of diabetes and obesity, is likely to continue to increase the prevalence of PAD. In many older PAD patients, particularly those with diabetes, PAD is characterized by fibrotic (moderately hard) or calcified (extremely hard) plaque deposits that can be very challenging to treat. Although we believe the rate of PAD diagnoses is increasing, we also believe that under-diagnosis continues, due to patients failing to display symptoms or physicians misinterpreting symptoms as normal aging. Emphasis on PAD education from industry, medical associations, insurance companies and other groups, coupled 
2

with publications in medical journals and public news channels, is increasing physician and patient awareness of PAD risk factors, symptoms, and treatment options. Physicians manage a significant portion of the PAD diagnosed population by recommending lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, and by prescribing prescription drugs, such as statins. While medications, diet and exercise may improve blood flow, they do not treat the underlying obstructions, and many patients have difficulty maintaining lifestyle changes. As a result of these challenges, many medically managed patients develop more severe symptoms that require procedural intervention.
Coronary Artery Disease (“CAD”)
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease in the U.S. and is a life-threatening condition. CAD occurs when a fatty material called plaque builds up on the walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart. The plaque buildup causes the arteries to harden and narrow (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow. The risk of CAD increases if a person has one or more of the following: high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, or family history of early heart disease. According to the AHA, 15.5 million people in the U.S. (or 6.2% of the adult population) suffer from CAD, the most common form of heart disease. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 370,000 lives are claimed in the U.S. each year from CAD. According to estimates, significant arterial calcium is present in nearly 40% of patients (Genereux et al., 2014; Bourantas et al., 2014), and severe calcium affects up to 20% of patients (Bourantas et al., 2014), undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (“PCI”). Significant calcium contributes to poor outcomes and higher treatment costs in coronary interventions when traditional therapies are used, including a significantly higher occurrence of death and major adverse cardiac events (“MACE”).
Our Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS
Our orbital atherectomy systems represent an innovative approach to the treatment of PAD and CAD that provide physicians and patients with a procedure that addresses many of the limitations of other treatment alternatives. The Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS devices are single-use catheters that incorporate a control handle and flexible drive shaft with an eccentrically mounted diamond-coated crown. The peripheral device is often used for vessel preparation to enable low pressure percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, including the use of drug-coated balloons (“DCB”), and results in lower use of bailout stents. The coronary device is used to treat severe calcium prior to stent delivery to help facilitate optimal stent expansion and prevent malapposition of stent struts. The OAS treats atherosclerotic plaque, which is harder than a normal vessel wall. The OAS is designed to differentiate between hard, diseased plaque and healthy, compliant arterial tissue, a concept that we refer to as “differential sanding.” The diamond-coated crown preferentially engages and sands away harder material, but is designed not to damage more compliant parts of the artery, which flex away from the crown. Physicians position the crown at the site of a lesion containing arterial plaque and orbit the crown against it to sand away the superficial, or surface, plaque and create a smooth lumen, or channel, in the vessel. In addition, the crown’s rotating eccentric mass and orbital motion deliver pulsatile mechanical energy into the vessel wall. These pulsatile forces may break up deeper plaque and contribute to compliance change of the diseased segment of the artery. 
Components of the OAS
Our OAS uses a single-use, low-profile catheter that travels over our proprietary ViperWire guide wires and is electrically powered by a saline infusion pump that also helps cool the system and remove debris. The Peripheral OAS reduces plaque on peripheral vessel walls by using an orbiting, diamond-coated crown within peripheral arteries. Similarly, the Coronary OAS uses the same method to reduce severely calcified plaque on coronary vessel walls within coronary arteries in order to facilitate stent delivery.
Catheter.  The catheter for our OAS consists of:

• | an electrically-powered control handle, which allows movement of the crown and predictable crown location;


• | a flexible drive shaft with an eccentrically mounted diamond-coated crown, which tracks and orbits over the guide wire; and


• | a sheath, which covers the drive shaft and permits delivery of saline or medications to the treatment area.

ViperWire Advance Peripheral Guide Wire, ViperWire Advance Peripheral Guide Wire with Flex Tip and ViperWire Advance Coronary Guide Wire. The ViperWire guide wires are required for using the OAS and were designed to offer the ability to maneuver through tortuous, twisting blood vessels and cross challenging lesions. The OAS travels over this wire to the lesion and operates on this wire.
ViperSlide Lubricant. ViperSlide is an exclusive lubricant designed to optimize the smooth operation of the OAS.

OAS Pump.  The saline infusion pump bathes the OAS shaft and crown and provides an electric power supply for the operation of the catheter. The constant flow of saline during orbit reduces the risk of heat generation and improves the flush of particulates.
Mechanism of Action
The mechanism of action is a function of the centrifugal force generated by the eccentrically mounted crown as it rotates and orbits inside the vessel. As the speed of the crown’s rotation increases, centrifugal force increases the crown’s radius of orbit and presses the diamond-coated crown against the lesion or plaque, removing a small amount of plaque with each orbit. The centrifugal force exerted onto the vessel wall decreases as the orbital radius increases, reducing the likelihood of adverse events during treatment. The characteristics of the orbit and the resulting lumen size can be adjusted by modifying the following two variables:

• | Speed. An increase in speed creates a larger orbital radius, thus accommodating larger diameter vessels. Our Peripheral OAS allows the user to choose between three rotational speeds and our Coronary OAS Classic Crown allows the user to choose between two rotational speeds. 


• | Crown Characteristics. The crowns for the OAS are designed with various weights (as determined by crown geometry and material density) and are coated with diamond particles. The Peripheral OAS crowns are available in three configurations: classic, micro and solid. Physicians select crown sizes and configurations based on several case criteria, including reference vessel size, lesion length and degree of stenosis, stenosis morphology, and anatomy tortuosity. The crown for the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS is available in two configurations: 1.25 millimeter classic crown and the recently-approved 1.25 millimeter micro crown which is designed to both pilot through tight, severely calcified coronary lesions and treat 2.5 to 4mm vessels with a single device. 

Centrifugal force propels the crown outward against the arterial wall as the crown rotates. This force is offset by the counterforce exerted by the arterial wall and the guidewire. Normal arteries are compliant and have the ability to expand and contract as needed to supply blood flow. If the tissue is compliant, it flexes away, minimizing the engagement of the diamond-grit and protecting the integrity of the healthy tissue. Diseased tissue is less flexible or non-compliant and provides resistance to the centrifugal force, which generates an opposing force that enables the diamond-coated crown to engage and sand the plaque. The sanded plaque and calcium is broken down into particles generally smaller than circulating red blood cells that are washed away downstream with the patient’s natural blood flow.
The small particle size and short treatment time minimizes the risk of vascular bed overload, or a saturation of the peripheral or coronary vessels with large particles, which may cause slow or reduced blood flow. The small size of the particles allows them to be naturally cleared from the blood via various types of white blood cells and macrophages.
We believe the OAS offers the following key benefits:
Strong Safety Profile

• | Differential Sanding Reduces Risk of Adverse Events. The OAS is designed to differentiate between hard, non-compliant plaque and soft, compliant arterial tissue. Arteries are composed of three tissue layers (from inside to out): the intima, media, and adventitia. The eccentrically mounted diamond-coated crown at the working end of the device engages and removes plaque from the artery wall with minimal likelihood of penetrating or damaging the fragile intima, or inner layer of the arterial wall because soft, compliant tissue flexes away from the crown. 


• | Eliminates Need for Distal Protection. The small size of the particles produced during sanding avoids the need for ancillary distal protection devices, commonly used with directional cutting atherectomy devices. The small particulate size also significantly reduces the risk of macroembolization, or larger pieces of removed plaque capable of blocking blood flow downstream.


• | Allows Continuous Blood Flow During Procedure. The OAS allows for continuous blood flow while orbiting, as well as constant flushing of particulates during treatment. Other devices may restrict blood flow due to the size of the catheter required or the use of distal protection devices, which could result in complications such as excessive heat and tissue damage.

• | Benefits of Smaller Sheaths. The Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS portfolio is uniquely compatible with 4 French (“Fr”) to 6Fr sheaths. Centrifugal force enables the OAS to treat large vessels through small sheaths; for example, it can treat up to 5mm vessel through a 4Fr sheath. Smaller sheaths may be associated with less femoral bleeding, shortened post-procedure ambulation time and reduced radiation exposure. In addition, the primary complication in peripheral interventions is a vascular access site complication. Exchanging to a larger sheath has been shown to be the strongest predictor of bleeding complication during peripheral interventions.

Proven Efficacy


• | Efficacy Demonstrated for Both Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS.


◦ | Peripheral OAS - Our pivotal OASIS clinical trial was a prospective 20-center study that involved 124 patients with 201 lesions treated by the Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS. Performance targets were established cooperatively with the FDA before the trial began. Despite 55% of the lesions consisting of calcified plaque, the Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS successfully met the study endpoints.


◦ | Coronary OAS - Our pivotal ORBIT II coronary OAS trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OAS in treating de novo severely calcified coronary lesions. The trial met both the primary safety and efficacy endpoints by significant margins. Preparation of severely calcified plaque with the Coronary OAS not only helped facilitate stent delivery, but also improved both peri-procedural and 30-day clinical outcomes compared with the outcomes of historic control subjects in this difficult-to-treat patient population.


• | Treats Difficult, Fibrotic and Calcified Lesions. The OAS enables physicians to remove plaque from long, fibrotic, calcified or bifurcated lesions, as well as lesions with softer plaque, in peripheral arteries both above and below the knee. In the coronary arteries, the OAS enables physicians to treat complex, severely calcified lesions, enabling stent placement in these difficult to treat lesions. To date, the Coronary OAS is the only FDA-approved device approved specifically for treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions. 


• | Orbital Motion Improves Lesion Compliance. The orbiting action of the OAS removes the hard plaque in the artery by sanding, while the centrifugal motion of the eccentrically mounted crown creates pulsatile forces. Compliance change is achieved as the OAS differentiates between hard, diseased plaque and healthy, compliant arterial tissue, a concept that we refer to as “differential sanding.” The diamond-coated crown preferentially engages and sands away harder material, but is designed not to damage more compliant parts of the artery, which flex away from the crown. Physicians position the crown at the site of a lesion containing arterial plaque and orbit the crown against it to sand away the superficial, or surface, plaque and create a smooth lumen, or channel, in the vessel. In addition, the crown’s rotating eccentric mass and orbital motion deliver pulsatile mechanical energy into the vessel wall. These pulsatile forces may break up deeper plaque and contribute to compliance change of the diseased segment of the artery. Together, these mechanistic components sufficiently remove or modify hard plaque, allowing for low pressure balloon inflation. The orbital motion and speed of the eccentrically mounted crown increases, thus allowing for continuous reduction of plaque with differential sanding and pulsatile forces, as the opening of the lumen increases during the operation of the devices. 


• | Differential Sanding Creates Smooth Lumens. The differential sanding of the OAS creates a smooth lumen surface, or channel, inside the vessel. We believe that the smooth lumens created by the device increase the velocity of blood flow and decrease the resistance to blood flow, which may decrease the potential for restenosis, or re-narrowing of the arteries. 

Ease of Use


• | Set Up Time. Given the relative simplicity of the OAS, physicians and lab staff can usually set up and begin using the device in under two minutes. 


• | Utilizes Familiar Techniques. Physicians using the OAS employ techniques similar to those used in angioplasty, which are familiar to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists who are trained in endovascular techniques. The devices’ simple user interfaces require minimal additional training. 


• | Single Crown Treats Multiple Lesions in Various Sized Vessels. Centrifugal force unique to OAS allows for a single access site to treat multiple lesions, in most cases. In the coronary arteries, Coronary OAS is the only atherectomy device able to treat 2.5 to 4mm vessels with one device through a 6Fr radial approach. In the peripheral vasculature, 

5

the OAS device is capable of treating multiple lesions in multiple arteries through a single access site, thus reducing the need for multiple devices or the need for multiple access sites.

• | No Need for Collection Reservoir. Because the particles of plaque sanded away are of such small sizes, the OAS does not require a collection reservoir that needs to be repeatedly emptied or cleaned during the procedure, which would potentially add time and cost to the procedure. 

Multiple Applications

The unique OAS mechanism of action used in both the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS can be used to treat multiple anatomic locations.

• | Below-the-Knee and Behind-the-Knee Peripheral Artery Disease. Arteries below and behind the knee are small in diameter and may be diffusely stenosed, calcified or both. Reaching and treating these small vessels requires a low profile, which most competitive devices do not offer. Behind-the-knee, or popliteal, lesions also present challenges if a stent is used because stents frequently fracture in this area due to the forces exerted on the vessels when the knee bends or flexes. The Diamondback 360 Peripheral OAS is effective in treating those vessels. The Peripheral OAS offers a shorter shaft length (60cm), a smaller profile and a more flexible shaft than the predecessors for improved ease of use, and includes a 4 Fr catheter that enables physicians to access lesions below-the-knee using retrograde access (access through the ankle or foot). 


• | Above-the-Knee Peripheral Artery Disease. Arteries above the knee are typically longer, straighter and wider than below-the-knee vessels. Plaque in these arteries may also be diffuse, fibrotic and calcific. Physicians often use higher speeds or larger crown sizes of our products to treat lesions above the knee. 


• | Coronary Artery Disease. The individuals more at risk for being diagnosed with CAD are those that are suffering from high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, renal insufficiency, or have a family history of heart disease. The pathogenesis of CAD is marked by the accumulation of a fatty material called plaque on the walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart. The plaque buildup causes the arteries to harden and narrow (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow. The Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS is the only atherectomy device specifically indicated for severe coronary calcium. 

Cost and Time Efficient Procedure


• | Short Procedure Time. The OAS has a short treatment time, typically less than two minutes. 


• | Single Crown Can Treat Various Lumen Sizes Helping Limit Hospital Costs. The OAS orbital mechanism of action allows one device to treat various diameter lumens inside the artery. Adjusting the rotational speed of the crown changes the orbit to create the desired lumen diameter, thereby potentially avoiding the need to use multiple catheters of different sizes to treat multiple lesions. 


• | Trans-Radial Access Provides Multiple Benefits. Treating complex, calcified lesions in the peripheral or coronary arteries remains difficult, particularly where patients may present challenging access sites. The OAS allows for trans-radial access with benefits to both physicians and patients. For physicians, this smaller access site provides lower vascular and bleeding complication rates, faster patient recovery time, and the ability to treat bilateral disease in one setting, address obese patients and work around previous, compromised access sites. For patients, this contributes to comfort during- and post-operation, earlier ambulation, reduced risk of infection, and faster healing.


• | Retrograde Access Treatment Option Benefits. Many of the patients treated with the Peripheral OAS have advanced PAD and suffer from CLI. These patients often have complex, calcified lesions in their lower leg, which are challenging to access and treat using the traditional femoral artery access site. If left untreated, these cases may result in lower limb amputation. CSI’s family of 1.25mm Peripheral OASs with 4Fr compatibility allows for more options to treat those lesions by providing a low-profile system that is fully compatible with alternative access sites in the foot or ankle. Smaller sheaths have been shown to reduce procedure times and decrease complications.

Our OAS Strategy
Our goal is to be the leading provider of low profile solutions for the treatment of peripheral and coronary artery disease. The key elements of our strategy include:

• | Drive Adoption through Our Direct U.S. Sales Organization, Medical Education and Key Opinion Leaders. We expect to continue to drive adoption of the OAS through our direct U.S. sales force in both hospital and office-based lab settings, which targets interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, and interventional radiologists. As a key element of our strategy, we focus on educating physicians about the disease states and our clinical data, and training physicians regarding the proper use and application of OAS technology through physician faculty, our direct sales force and through seminars where physician industry leaders discuss case studies and treatment techniques using the devices. 


• | Collect Additional Clinical Evidence on Safety, Effectiveness and Economic Benefits of the OAS. Physicians and payers are increasingly requesting clinical and economic evidence to allow them to make decisions regarding optimal treatment of patients. We are focused on collecting clinical and economic evidence to demonstrate the advantages of the OAS in treating complex disease states such as peripheral and coronary artery disease. We believe that the clinical advantages and cost effectiveness of our OAS technology will help drive physician utilization of the OAS and sustain ongoing reimbursement coverage for our devices. 


• | Enhance OAS and Expand Product Portfolio within the Market for Treatment of Peripheral and Coronary Arteries. In addition to enhancing the OAS, we offer multiple accessory devices for use with the OAS. We are continuing product development to further expand our portfolio of PAD and CAD treatment solutions. 


• | International Expansion. In March 2017, we received regulatory approval for our coronary OAS Micro Crown device in Japan. We are evaluating options for further international expansion to maximize the coronary and peripheral market opportunities.


• | Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships. In addition to adding to our product portfolio through internal development efforts, we intend to explore the acquisition of other product lines, technologies or companies that may leverage our sales force or complement our strategic objectives. We also intend to explore distribution agreements, licensing transactions, manufacturing agreements and other strategic partnerships. 

Research and Development Activities
Clinical Studies Summary
We study the most challenging patient populations and are committed to providing relevant clinical evidence that enables physicians to select and utilize the best treatment options for their patients. A total of 5,735 subjects (4,764 PAD and 971 CAD) have been enrolled in our clinical studies as of June 30, 2017. Our clinical studies incorporate rigorous long-term clinical and healthcare economic data that are critical to improving patient care and ongoing healthcare changes. 
We have completed numerous clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Peripheral OAS. The results of these studies consistently demonstrate that the Peripheral OAS provides predictable, repeatable and durable results that differentiate it from other PAD treatments. 
The following PAD clinical studies were completed or in process during fiscal 2017:

• | LIBERTY 360°. This prospective, observational, multi-center clinical study is evaluating the procedural and long-term clinical, quality of life and economic outcomes of endovascular device interventions, including orbital atherectomy, for the treatment of PAD. We expect the results from this study to increase our understanding of the clinical and economic outcomes of endovascular treatment for PAD patients, including those with the most advanced form of the disease, Rutherford Class 6. Enrollment of 1,204 subjects at 51 sites in the U.S. was completed in February 2016. 

7

LIBERTY 360° data were presented in February and August 2017. The majority of devices used in the study were balloons and/or atherectomy, and the Peripheral OAS was the most frequently used atherectomy device. The LIBERTY 360° data through one year demonstrated that peripheral interventions can be used successfully across all Rutherford classes, including the most challenging Rutherford Class 6 subjects. Overall, the results of this novel all-comers PAD study suggest that peripheral vascular intervention (“PVI”) is an alternative to “primary amputation” in Rutherford Class 6 patients. Additionally, data from the LIBERTY 360° study provide further evidence to support PVI treatment in Rutherford 2-5 patients. 

• | OPTIMIZE BTK. This post-market, multi-center, randomized clinical study conducted in Europe is designed to evaluate the acute and long-term clinical outcomes of orbital atherectomy with adjunctive DCB angioplasty versus DCB angioplasty alone in PAD patients with calcified, below-the-knee lesions. Fifty evaluable subjects will be enrolled in OPTIMIZE BTK and will be followed for up to two years.

We have conducted two clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Coronary OAS Classic Crown device: the ORBIT I feasibility study and the ORBIT II pivotal study. The safety and efficacy of the Coronary OAS Micro Crown device were evaluated in the COAST study. In fiscal 2017, we launched ECLIPSE, as described below.
The following CAD clinical studies were completed or in process during fiscal 2017:

• | COAST. This prospective, single-arm, multi-center, global Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Coronary OAS Micro Crown in treating de novo, severely calcified lesions prior to stent implantation. Enrollment of 100 patients, including 74 patients at 12 sites in the U.S. and 26 patients at five sites in Japan, was completed in July 2015. The study results through one year were presented in February 2017. The overall one-year MACE rate, defined as the composite of myocardial infarction (“MI”), cardiac death, and target vessel revascularization, was 22.2%. The COAST MI rate did not increase from 30 days to one year, and low rates of one-year cardiac death (1.0%) and target lesion revascularization (6.3%) were reported. 


• | MACE. This prospective, multi-center, non-randomized study assessed the outcomes of current standard of care treatment in none/mild, moderate, and severely calcified coronary lesions. Treatment of the target lesion excluded use of OAS. Enrollment of 350 subjects was completed in September 2015. The one-year results of the MACE study were presented in February 2017. The MACE data through one year indicate that severe calcium is associated with higher short and long-term major adverse cardiac event rates compared to both none/mild and moderate calcification.


• | ECLIPSE. This post-market, randomized one-to-one, multi-center trial is designed to evaluate vessel preparation with OAS compared to conventional angioplasty technique prior to drug-eluting stent implantation for the treatment of severely calcified lesions. Approximately 2,000 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 150 sites in the U.S. and subjects will be followed for up to two years. The co-primary endpoints of acute minimum stent area (assessed by optical coherence tomography in a subset of 400 subjects) and one-year target vessel failure are powered to demonstrate superiority of OAS vessel preparation vs. conventional angioplasty.

Our clinical portfolio is expanding as we develop future studies to answer difficult questions about PAD and CAD treatment. Our clinical research continues to highlight the safety and efficacy of the OAS and current and new research illustrates our versatility in the emerging vascular market. 
Development Activities
Our product research and development activities are dedicated to the development and commercialization of products that serve the peripheral and coronary vascular disease space, with emphasis towards high margin products and complex arterial disease states treated by our primary customers. The focus and value proposition of our products is to enable positive acute and long-term clinical outcomes, with efficiency and predictability, in challenging patient subsets.   
Research and development resources have been strategically allocated between opportunities that maximize the clinical effectiveness and user satisfaction of our OAS product line and the development of additional products that offer portfolio diversification and incremental revenue opportunities.
Specific to the peripheral vascular disease market, we will continue our commitment to patients suffering from CLI through a breadth of above-the-knee and below-the-knee differentiated products that treat or uniquely expand the ability of our devices to treat obstructive lesions throughout the leg and foot. Most recently, we launched the Diamondback 360 Low Profile Peripheral, a line of next generation low profile orbital atherectomy devices that enable physicians to intervene through 4Fr and 5Fr access 
8

sheaths. Low profile devices offer numerous benefits, including a reduction in access site complications, improved device deliverability, compatibility with alternative access sites and a reduction in post-procedure time to ambulation. Specific to the coronary vascular disease market, we are building a portfolio of differentiated products that are used to treat complex CAD. Emphasis in both franchises is placed on novel and differentiated devices that address unmet or under-met clinical or technical needs.
Research and development expenses for the years ended June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $22.9 million, $25.9 million and $31.0 million, respectively.
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our products through a direct sales force in the United States. Revenues for the years ended June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $204.9 million, $178.2 million and $181.5 million, respectively. We have targeted sales and marketing efforts to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists with experience using similar catheter-based procedures, such as angioplasty, stenting, and directional or laser atherectomy. Professional education is also a key element of our sales strategy.
We target our marketing efforts to practitioners through medical conferences, seminars, peer-reviewed journals and marketing materials. Our sales and marketing program focuses on:

• | clinical results showing safety and efficacy of our products;


• | educating physicians on the prevalence and complications of calcium in PAD and CAD; and


• | developing relationships with key opinion leaders.

We sell the majority of our products through direct shipment to hospitals or clinics. We are party to a Purchasing Agreement with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, L.P. (“HPG”) which became effective on August 1, 2014 and expires on January 31, 2018. HPG acts as a group purchasing organization for the healthcare providers belonging to HPG as participants. Under the Purchasing Agreement, all of HPG’s participants located in the U.S. or its territories are eligible to purchase our products at prices set forth in the Purchasing Agreement.
Manufacturing

We use internally-manufactured and externally-sourced components to manufacture the OAS. Most of the externally-sourced components are available from multiple suppliers; however, certain key components, including the diamond-grit-coated crown and our ViperSlide Lubricant, are single sourced. We have strategies and arrangements in place for procuring our key components from alternative suppliers in the event that one or more of our single source suppliers were to discontinue supplying us with a key component. We assemble the shaft, crown and handle components on-site, and test, pack, seal and label the finished assembly before sending the packaged product to a contract sterilization facility. Upon return from the sterilizer, the product is held in inventory prior to shipping to our customers.
We are located in a 125,000-square-foot corporate headquarters in Minnesota, which we now lease. This custom-designed building has space for more than 500 employees and contains dedicated research and development, training and education, and manufacturing facilities. Depending on staffing, the facility has the annual capacity to produce in excess of 75,000 devices per shift. The finished goods storage has capacity for approximately 20,000 devices and more than 500 saline infusion pumps, as well as other accessory products. 
Our Pearland, Texas facility is 46,000 square feet and includes a custom-built clean room and production space for future expansion of value-add processes, including machining and electronics assembly. The facility, when fully staffed and equipped, also has the annual capacity to produce approximately 75,000 devices per shift. This facility has finished goods storage capacity for greater than 15,000 devices and other accessory products and over 500 saline infusion pumps. 
We believe that our facilities in Minnesota and Texas will provide adequate production, assembly, and warehousing capacity for the foreseeable future.
We are registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer. We have opted to maintain quality assurance and quality management certifications to enable us to market our products in the member states of the European Union (“EU”), the European Free Trade Association and countries that have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the EU. We are ISO 13485:2003 certified, and our renewal is due by December 2018. Under these registrations, our plants are audited by the 
9

FDA and our Notified Body for the EU CE Mark. Our Stealth 360 has received CE Mark. We are registered as a Foreign Medical Device Manufacturer in Japan and our registration certificate renewal is due by June 2021.
Third-Party Reimbursement and Pricing

Third-party payors, including private insurers, and government insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, pay for a significant portion of patient care provided in the United States. The single largest payor in the U.S. is the Medicare program, a federal governmental health insurance program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). Medicare covers certain medical care expenses for eligible elderly and disabled individuals, including a large percentage of the population with PAD and CAD who could be treated with the OAS. In addition, private insurers often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare. Consequently, Medicare’s coverage and reimbursement policies are important to our operations. 
CMS has established Medicare reimbursement codes describing atherectomy products and procedures using atherectomy products. We believe that physicians and hospitals that treat PAD and CAD with the respective OAS will generally be eligible to receive reimbursement from Medicare, as well as private insurers, for the cost of the single-use catheter and the physician’s services. 
Competition

The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Our OAS devices compete with a variety of other products or devices for the treatment of vascular disease, including stents, balloon angioplasty catheters and atherectomy catheters, as well as products used in vascular surgery. Large competitors in the stent and balloon angioplasty market segments include Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific, Cook Medical, Johnson & Johnson, BARD, and Medtronic. We also compete against manufacturers of atherectomy catheters including, among others, Medtronic, Spectranetics, Boston Scientific, Philips, and Avinger, as well as manufacturers that may enter the market due to the increasing demand for treatment of vascular disease. Other competitors include pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for the treatment of PAD and CAD and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures. We are not aware of any competing high-speed rotational atherectomy systems either currently on the market or in development that also generate an orbital motion with an eccentric solid abrasive crown to create lumens with diameters that are larger than the diameter of the abrasive crown itself. 
Because of the size of the peripheral opportunities, competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated significant resources to aggressively promote their products. We believe that our Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS compete primarily on the basis of:

• | safety and efficacy, even in calcified plaque (or severely calcified plaque in the coronaries);


• | low profile and alternative access site capabilities;


• | predictable clinical performance;


• | availability of clinical data;


• | ease of use;


• | economic benefit;


• | key opinion leader support and customer base; and


• | customer service and support.

Patents and Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and other intellectual property laws, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights. As of June 2017, we held 44 issued U.S. patents and have 39 U.S. patent applications pending, as well as 262 issued or granted foreign patents and 187 foreign patent applications, each of which corresponds to aspects of our U.S. patents and applications. Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2017 and 2035, and our patents covering the core technology begin to expire in 2023 while providing core technology coverage through 2035. We have many additional patents relating to our core technology currently pending in the USPTO, which will extend our key covered subject matter and coverage dates significantly. Our issued patents and patent applications relate primarily to the design and operation of interventional atherectomy devices, including the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS. These patents and applications include claims covering key aspects of orbital atherectomy devices, including the design, manufacture and therapeutic use of certain atherectomy abrasive heads, drive shafts, control systems, handles and couplings. As we continue to research and develop our atherectomy technology, we intend to file additional U.S. and foreign patent applications related to 
10

the design, manufacture and therapeutic uses of atherectomy devices. In addition, we hold 19 registered U.S. trademarks, 12 registered marks in the Madrid Protocol with protection granted within at least one of Australia, Europe, China, Japan and Mexico, six registered marks in Europe, five registered marks in Canada, five registered marks in Mexico, and eight registered marks in Hong Kong. We have three trademark applications pending in the U.S., eight trademark applications pending in Canada and 12 trademark applications pending in India.
We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also forbid them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
Government Regulation of Medical Devices
Governmental authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local levels and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of medical devices such as the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS.
Failure to obtain approval to market our products under development and to meet the ongoing requirements of these regulatory authorities could prevent us from marketing and continuing to market our products.
United States
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and the FDA’s implementing regulations govern medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post market surveillance. Medical devices and their manufacturers are also subject to inspection by the FDA. The FDCA, supplemented by other federal and state laws, also provides civil and criminal penalties for violations of its provisions.
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization are premarket notification (also called 510(k) clearance) and PMA.
510(k) Clearance.    To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device legally marketed in the United States. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data. Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more.
After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA (if the device as modified is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device). The determination as to whether new authorization is needed is initially left to the manufacturer; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
We received 510(k) clearance for use of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral as a therapy in patients with PAD in the U.S. in August 2007. We received additional 510(k) clearances for the control unit used with the Diamondback 360
Peripheral on October 25, 2007 and for the solid crown version of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral in November 2007.
We were granted 510(k) clearance of the Predator 360 in March 2009 and Stealth 360 in March 2011. We received 510(k)
clearance of the Diamondback 360 Peripheral 1.25 Micro in November 2013 and the Diamondback 360 60cm Peripheral
in February 2014. The Diamondback 360 Low Profile Peripheral received FDA clearance in April 2015. We received
clearance of the ViperWire Advance Flex Tip Guide Wire in June 2015. The Diamondback 360 1.50 Peripheral and
Diamondback 360 2.00 Peripheral were each granted 510(k) clearance in October 2015.

Premarket Approval.    A PMA application requires the payment of significant user fees and must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device. A PMA application must also include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling. After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
FDA review of a PMA application is required by statute to take no longer than 180 days, although the process typically takes significantly longer, and may require several years to complete. The FDA can delay, limit, or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:

• | the systems may not be safe or effective to the FDA’s satisfaction;


• | the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval;


• | the manufacturing process or facilities used may not meet applicable requirements; and


• | changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.

If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA application. Even if a PMA application is approved, the FDA may approve the device with an indication that is narrower or more limited than originally sought. The agency can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of the device as a condition of approval, or impose post approval requirements such as continuing evaluation and periodic reporting on the safety, efficacy, and reliability of the device for its intended use.
New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
Clinical Trials.  Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance. These trials generally require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites.
FDA approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. With certain exceptions, changes made to an investigational plan after an IDE is approved must be submitted in an IDE supplement and approved by FDA (and by governing institutional review boards when appropriate) prior to implementation.
All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with regulations and requirements collectively known as Good Clinical Practice. Good clinical practices include the FDA’s IDE regulations, which describe the conduct of clinical trials with medical devices, including the recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of sponsors and investigators, and labeling of investigational devices. They also prohibit promotion, test marketing or commercialization of an investigational device and any representation that such a device is safe or effective for the purposes being investigated. Good clinical practices also include the FDA’s regulations for institutional review board approval and for protection of human subjects (such as informed consent), as well as disclosure of financial interests by clinical investigators.
12

Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application or clearance of a premarket notification for numerous reasons.
Continuing Regulation.    After a device is cleared or approved for use and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

• | establishment registration and device listing upon the commencement of manufacturing;


• | the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during medical device design and manufacturing processes;


• | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and promotional activities;


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if malfunctions were to recur;


• | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections; and


• | product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device that may present a risk to health.

In addition, the FDA may require a company to conduct post market surveillance studies or order it to establish and maintain a system for tracking its products through the chain of distribution to the patient level.
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:

• | warning letters or untitled letters;


• | fines, injunctions and civil penalties;


• | product recall or seizure;


• | unanticipated expenditures;


• | delays in clearing or approving or refusal to clear or approve products;


• | withdrawal or suspension of FDA approval;


• | orders for physician notification or device repair, replacement or refund;


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production or clinical trials; or


• | criminal prosecution.

We and our contract manufacturers, specification developers and suppliers are also required to manufacture our products in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements set forth in the QSR.
The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing and record keeping. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers is not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to clear or approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business.
In April 2017, we initiated a voluntary recall of one type of our saline infusion pumps. We plan to recall and
replace approximately 900 units that were in customer inventory at the time the recall commenced. As of June 30,
2017, we had approximately 338 pumps remaining to be replaced.

Fraud and Abuse
Our operations are directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the FDCA, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, our sales, marketing, education and clinical programs. In addition, these laws may require us to screen individuals and other companies, suppliers and vendors in order to ensure that they are not “debarred” by the federal government and, therefore, prohibited from doing business in the healthcare industry.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
In addition to the laws described above, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
On June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the U.S. government, acting through the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of North Carolina (the “DOJ”) and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the “OIG”) and Travis Thams to resolve the DOJ investigation of whether we violated the False Claims Act. In connection with the resolution of this matter, we entered into a five-year corporate integrity agreement (the “Corporate Integrity Agreement”) with the OIG. The Corporate Integrity Agreement requires that we maintain our existing compliance programs and imposes certain expanded compliance-related requirements during the term of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, including establishment of specific procedures and requirements regarding consulting activities, co-marketing activities and other interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare institutions and the sale and marketing of our products; ongoing monitoring, reporting, certification and training obligations; and the engagement of an independent review organization to perform certain auditing and reviews and prepare certain reports regarding our compliance with federal health care programs. 
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, and certain state laws require persons to collect and report certain data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. It is widely anticipated that public reporting under the Sunshine Act and implementing Open Payment regulations will result in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, physicians and teaching hospitals.
Voluntary industry codes, federal guidance documents and a variety of state laws address the tracking and reporting of marketing practices relative to gifts given and other expenditures made to doctors and other healthcare professionals. In addition to impacting our marketing and educational programs, our internal business processes are and will continue to be affected by the numerous legal requirements and regulatory guidance at the state, federal and industry levels.
International Regulation 
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ. For example, the primary regulatory environment in Europe with respect to medical devices is that of the EU, which includes most of the major countries in Europe. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the EU with respect to medical devices. The EU has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for 
14

medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the EU, although actual implementation of these directives may vary on a country-by-country basis. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of submission of a design dossier, self-assessment by the manufacturer, a third-party assessment, and review of the design dossier by a “Notified Body.” This third-party assessment generally consists of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and manufacturing site, as well as review of the technical documentation used to support application of the CE Mark to one’s product and possibly specific testing of the manufacturer’s product. An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the EU is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the EU. 
In July 2016, we submitted an application to Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) for approval of our Coronary OAS Micro Crown and received approval in March 2017. Pending reimbursement approval, Japan will become the first international market for any CSI product. As part of our anticipated Japan commercialization process we will be subject to the requirements of the Japanese Act on Securing Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, Regenerative and Cellular Therapy Products, Gene Therapy Products, and Cosmetics (the “PMD Act”). Our quality management system and products will be subject to review and examination by PMDA and subject to approval and enforcement by Japan’s MHLW. The critical suppliers named in our application will also be subject to this review and examination for the activities they perform for us. Non-compliance with the PMD Act could result in revocation or suspension of our license, revocation of approvals, and criminal sanctions such as fines and/or imprisonment. 
In addition, any international expansion, operations and sales that we undertake will require us to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions and with U.S. and foreign export control, trade embargo and custom laws.
Environmental Regulation
Our operations are subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances. We are currently classified and licensed as a Very Small Quantity Hazardous Waste Generator within Ramsey County, Minnesota. There are no regulated wastes requiring licensing in our Texas facility.
Employees
As of June 30, 2017, we had 579 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
