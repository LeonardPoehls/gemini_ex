 Item 1.  Business.
 Overview 
 Capstone Turbine Corporation (“Capstone”, “We” or the “Company”) develops, manufactures, markets and services microturbine technology solutions for use in stationary distributed power generation applications, including cogeneration (combined heat and power (“CHP”), integrated combined heat and power (“ICHP”), and combined cooling, heat and power (“CCHP”)), renewable energy, natural resources and critical power supply. In addition, our microturbines can be used as battery charging generators for hybrid electric vehicle applications. Microturbines allow customers to produce power on site in parallel with the electric grid or stand-alone when no utility grid is available. Several technologies are used to provide “on site power generation” (also called “distributed generation”) such as reciprocating engines, solar power, wind turbine systems and fuel cells. For customers who do not have access to the electric utility grid, microturbines provide clean, on site power with fewer scheduled maintenance intervals and greater fuel flexibility than competing technologies. For customers with access to the electric grid, microturbines provide an additional source of continuous duty power, thereby providing additional reliability and potential cost savings. With our stand alone feature, customers can produce their own energy in the event of a power outage and can use microturbines as their primary source of power for extended periods. Because our microturbines also produce clean, usable heat energy, they provide economic advantages to customers who can benefit from the use of hot water, chilled water, air conditioning and heating. Our microturbines are sold, installed and serviced primarily through our global distribution network. Together with our distributors, we offer new and remanufactured parts as well as a comprehensive Factory Protection Plan (“FPP”).
 We offer microturbines designed for commercial, industrial and utility users with product offerings ranging from 30 kilowatts (“kW”) to one megawatt (“MW”) in electric power output. Our microturbines combine patented air bearing technology, advanced combustion technology and sophisticated power electronics to form efficient and ultra-low emission electricity and cooling and heat production systems. Because of our air bearing technology, our microturbines do not require lube oil or coolant. This means they do not require routine maintenance to change and dispose of oil or other liquid lubricants, as do the most common reciprocating engines. Our microturbines can be fueled by various sources, including natural gas, propane, sour gas, renewable fuels such as landfill or digester gas, kerosene, butane, diesel and biodiesel. Our microturbines are available with integrated heat exchangers, making them easy to engineer and install in applications where hot water, chilled water, air conditioning and heating is used. 
 We sell complete microturbine units, components and various accessories. We also remanufacture microturbine engines and provide aftermarket parts and services. Our microturbines are sold primarily through distributors and Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”). Distributors purchase our products for sale to end users and also provide service, application engineering and installation support. Distributors also provide a variety of additional services, including engineering the applications in which the microturbines will be used, installation support of the products at the end users’ sites, commissioning the installed applications and providing post commissioning service, including a comprehensive FPP. Our distributors perform as independent value added resellers. OEMs integrate our products into their own product solutions.
 This Annual Report on Form 10 K (this “Form 10 K”) refers to our fiscal years ending March 31 as its “Fiscal” years.
 Products
 Our 30 kW (“C30”) microturbine can produce enough electricity to power a small convenience store. The 65 kW (“C65”) microturbine can produce enough heat to provide hot water to a 100 room hotel while also providing about one third of its electrical requirements. Our 200 kW (“C200”) microturbine is well suited for larger hotels, office buildings and wastewater treatment plants, among others. By packaging the C200 microturbine power modules into an International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) sized container, we have created a family of microturbine offerings from 600 kW up to one megawatt in a compact footprint. Our 600kW, 800kW and 1000 kW (“C1000 Series”)

microturbines are well suited for utility substations, larger commercial and industrial facilities and remote oil and gas applications.
 We began commercial sales of our C30 products in 1998, targeting the emerging distributed generation industry that was being driven by fundamental changes in power requirements. In September 2000, we shipped the first commercial unit of our 60 kW microturbine (“C60”), which was replaced by the C65 model during the quarter ended March 31, 2006. We began shipping the C60 ICHP solution in 2003. Our C60 microturbine was the first combustion power generation product to be certified by the CARB as meeting its stringent distributed generation emissions standards that went into effect in 2003. The first commercial C200 microturbine was shipped on August 28, 2008. Our C1000 Series product was developed based on our C200 microturbine engine. The C1000 Series product can be configured into 1,000 kW, 800 kW and 600 kW solutions in a single ISO sized container. The first commercial shipment of our C1000 Series product was on December 29, 2008. During Fiscal 2016, we unveiled our C1000 Signature (“C1000S’) microturbine as part of our new C1000S microturbine energy systems which also includes an 800kW (“C800S”) or 600kW (“C600S”) microturbine. The C1000S microturbine incorporates over 70 components, system and design upgrades intended to improve the overall product quality and enhance the microturbine ownership experience in all applications but specifically for CHP and CCHP applications. We began shipping the C200 and C1000 Signature Series ICHP solution in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
 Our microturbines are compact, lightweight and environmentally friendly generators of electricity and heat compared to competing technologies. They operate on the same principle as a jet engine using a variety of commercially available fuels. For example, our microturbines can operate on low British Thermal Unit (“BTU”) gas, which is gas with lower energy content, and can also operate on gas with a high amount of sulfur, known in the industry as sour gas. Examples of these fuel sources include methane from facilities such as wastewater treatment plants, landfills and anaerobic digesters. Our microturbine’s multi fuel capability provides competitive advantages with respect to some of our selected vertical markets. The combustor system remains the same for all fuels except for the fuel injectors, which currently vary between liquid and gaseous fuels.
 Our microturbines incorporate four major design features: advanced combustion technology, patented air bearing technology, digital power electronics and proprietary remote monitoring systems.
 Our advanced combustion technology allows our microturbines to achieve low emissions. Our natural gas fueled C65 and C200 microturbines were certified by the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) as meeting its stringent 2007 emissions requirements—the same emissions standard used to certify fuel cells and the same emissions levels as a central power plant. Our C65 and C200 Landfill and Digester Gas systems were certified by the CARB as meeting its 2008 waste gas emissions requirements for landfill and digester gas applications. These low emission levels not only provide an environmentally friendly product, but also eliminate permitting requirements in several municipalities for continuously operated onsite power generation. 
 The patented air bearing system allows the microturbine’s single moving assembly to produce power without the need for typical petroleum based lubrication. Air bearings use a high pressure field of air rather than petroleum lubricants. This improves reliability and reduces maintenance such as oil changes. 
 The digital power electronics manage critical functions and monitor operations of the microturbine; our electronic controls manage the microturbine’s speed, temperature and fuel flow and communication with external networks and building management systems. The digital power electronics coordinate with the grid when the units are operated in a grid connect mode and with the onboard battery when equipped for standalone mode. All control functions are performed digitally. Performance is optimized, resulting in low emissions, high reliability and high efficiency over a variable power range. 
 Our proprietary Capstone Remote Monitoring Software (“CRMS”) allows end users to operate and manage the microturbine remotely. This remote capability can provide end users with power generation flexibility and cost savings.
 Our electronic controls manage microturbines using our proprietary software and advanced algorithms. The controls start the turbogenerator and manage its load, coordinate the functioning of the microturbine with the grid, 

 
  3

 
manage the speed, fuel flow and exhaust temperature of the microturbine, convert the variable frequency, up to a maximum of 1,600 Hertz and variable voltage power produced by the generator into a usable output of either 50 or 60 Hertz AC for stationary applications or DC for hybrid electric vehicle applications, and provide digital communications to externally maintain and control the equipment.
 The electrical output of our units can be paralleled in multiple unit configurations through our Advanced Power Server product and a digital communications cable to serve larger installations requiring electrical loads up to ten megawatts. Our products can operate connected to the electric utility grid as a current source, on a standalone basis as a voltage source, multipacked to support larger loads as a “virtual single” unit and in dual mode, where the microturbine operates connected to the electric utility grid or operates independently. 
 We were the first microturbine manufacturer to achieve UL Class I, Division 2 certification and ATEX certification for operation in hazardous area oil and gas applications. These specially packaged systems are applied in oil and gas production areas with potentially explosive environments. Our C65, C200 and C1000 Series grid connect and stand-alone microturbines are listed by Underwriters Laboratories (“UL”) as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements.
 Our C30 and C60 microturbines are certified by the California Energy Commission and were the first products to comply with the requirements of its “Rule 21” grid interconnection standard. This standard streamlines the process for connecting distributed generation systems to the grid in California. The benefits of achieving this standard include avoiding both costly external equipment procurement requirements and extensive site by site and utility by utility analysis. Our protective relay functionality has also been recognized by the State of New York, which allows our microturbines to be connected to New York’s electric utility grid.
 We offer various accessories for our products including rotary gas compressors with digital controls, integrated heat recovery modules for CHP applications, dual mode controllers that allow automatic transition between grid connect and stand-alone modes, batteries with digital controls for stand-alone or dual mode operations, power servers for large multipack installations, protocol converters for Internet access, packaging options and miscellaneous parts such as frames, exhaust ducting, backflow dampers and installation hardware. 
 Applications
 Stationary power generation applications can vary greatly depending on load size and demand location. From small 2 kW back-up generators to several large 1,000 MW central generating facilities, stationary power systems can offer superior fuel efficiency for the customer while also meeting strict emissions regulations. Historically, power generation in developed countries such as the United States has been part of a regulated utility system. However, a number of developments related primarily to the deregulation of the utility industry as well as significant technology advances have helped to broaden the range of power supply options available to interested parties.

Our full line of microturbine energy solutions target multiple vertical markets worldwide, including energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply, transportation and marine. Within these vertical markets, we focus on applications that we believe have the greatest near term potential for the customer based on various different factors such as energy load demand, available fuels, economic payback and for some, government incentives. We also target smaller sub segments that fall within these vertical markets that may not otherwise be considered for on-site generation.
 Energy Efficiency—CHP/CCHP
 Energy efficiency refers to the proper utilization of both electrical and thermal energies in the power production process. In such applications, our microturbines are able to maximize the availability of usable energy which we believe provides a significant economic advantage to our customers while reducing their onsite emissions. CHP and CCHP can improve site economics by capturing the waste heat created from a single combustion process to increase the efficiency of the total system, from approximately 30 percent to 80 percent or more. Compared with more traditional, independent 

 
  4

 
generation sources, the increase in operational efficiency also reduces greenhouse gas emissions through the displacement of other separate systems, which can also reduce operating costs.
 When compared to onsite boilers, microturbines generally produce fewer commonly found air pollutants (“criteria pollutants”), such as nitrogen oxides (“NOx”), carbon monoxide (“CO”) and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”). In fact, our CHP or CCHP system can displace local boiler emissions altogether. A high efficiency CHP or CCHP system can allow for reduced net utility costs for end users as well as improved fuel consumption. The most common uses for captured thermal energy include space heating and air conditioning, water heating and water chilling, direct-drying and steam for industrial applications. In CCHP applications, the microturbine exhaust drives an absorption chiller, which produces the chilled water necessary for air conditioning and local use. Organizations of all sizes have used the heat generated by our microturbines at the many different types of commercial and industrial applications they serve, including hotels and resorts, hospitals and medical centers, as well as office buildings and large retail facilities.
 We offer fully integrated microturbine-powered CHP and CCHP solutions for installation in one of three modes: stand-alone, back-up and dual-mode. Each dual-mode microturbine can operate as a microgrid with the ability to run with or independent of a traditional grid or utility. The use of microgrids to serve local loads helps to reduce energy losses in transmission and distribution, further increasing the efficiency of the microgrid. Our microturbines have the ability to meet the needs of microgrid end-users by lowering their overall cost to operate and by providing a versatile technology that is fuel flexible and scalable enough to fit a wide variety of applications.
 Renewable Energy
 There is a growing transition to renewable energy sources and technologies on a global scale. Our microturbines run efficiently on renewable fuels such as methane and other biogases from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and other small biogas applications like food processing plants, livestock farms and agricultural waste operations. Microturbines can burn these renewable fuels with minimal emissions, thereby, and in some cases, avoiding the imposition of penalties incurred for pollution while simultaneously producing electricity from this “free” fuel source for use at the site or in the surrounding areas. Our microturbines have demonstrated effectiveness in these smaller applications and may outperform conventional combustion engines in some situations, including when the gas contains a high amount of sulfur.
 We introduced our C65 and C200 stand-alone digester products to the renewable energy market segment in 2007 and 2013, respectively. With these products, we are able to target many different types of renewable energy applications, including biogas producing facilities in third world countries and in remote locations that offer a valuable fuel source for the generation of electricity. The performance of our C65 digester gas system has been routinely evaluated to ensure that the combustion system is stable from 0 to 100 percent power output. Minor controls changes have been implemented to increase stability at low power levels. The ability to convert this low British Thermal Unit (“BTU”) fuel to electricity along with the high reliability and low maintenance features of this product make it well suited for this market. 
 Natural Resources—Crude Oil, Natural Gas, Shale Gas & Mining
 Our microturbines are installed in the natural resource market for use in both onshore and offshore applications, including oil and gas exploration, production, and at compression and transmission sites as a highly efficient and reliable source of power. In some cases, these oil and gas or mining operations have no electric utility grid and rely solely on power generated onsite. There are numerous locations, on a global scale, where the drilling, production, compression and transportation of natural resources and other extraction and production processes create fuel byproducts, which are traditionally burned or released into the atmosphere. Our microturbines can turn these fuel byproducts, flare gas or associated gas, into a useable fuel to provide power to these sites. 
 Major oil and gas companies are exploring large shale reserves, or plays, in the United States. In 2010, we sold our first microturbines into the U.S. shale gas market at locations in the Eagle Ford and Marcellus shale plays. The addressable market for our microturbines in this industry is significant. The shale gas market for microturbines may grow as demand for natural gas continues to rise and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the 

 
  5

 
Department of the Interior and other federal and state agencies work to reduce the emission of hazardous air pollutants associated with natural gas development. We have participated in several Natural Gas STAR workshops in the United States and foreign markets to demonstrate the emissions reductions its technology can provide.
 The C30, C65 and C200 microturbines can be configured to meet Class 1 Zone 2 hazardous location requirements for the natural resources market. Hazardous location requirements are met through package ventilation changes for purging and pressurizing package air to avoid potential flammable mixtures as well as controls for emergency disconnect of fuel and electrical sources. The package is upgraded to stainless steel construction to withstand the often corrosive offshore environments where these units are installed. Oil and gas customers often prefer power generation systems that offer low maintenance and high reliability in order to ensure continued production.
 Critical Power Supply
 Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of system failure, momentary or otherwise, certain high demand power users, including high technology, health care and information systems facilities require higher levels of reliability in their power generation service. To meet these customer requirements, traditional solutions utilize Uninterruptible Power Supplies (“UPS”) to protect critical loads from power disturbances along with back-up diesel generators for extended outages. We offer an alternative solution that can both meet customer reliability requirements and reduce operating costs.
 We have developed the world’s only microturbine-powered UPS solutions that offer clean, IT grade power and can completely displace the need for traditional UPS and back-up diesel generators. We offer two UL listed microturbine powered UPS solutions: our UPSource microturbine powered solution, which provides a source for prime or emergency power; as well as our Hybrid UPS microturbine-powered solution, which provides power when dispatched in high efficiency, standard UPS and emergency power. Both critical power supply products offer eight nines of availability in an n+1 configuration when the product has at least one independent back-up source. This measurement of availability is used in the data center industry to refer to 99.999999% of reliability. These integrated solutions are ideal for new facility construction or expansion and can be installed with absorption chillers or other heat recovery systems to obtain high efficiency levels while reducing operating costs, compared with traditional solutions.
 Dual-mode units operating in a prime power configuration can support a 150 percent overload for up to 10 seconds during transient conditions. Dual-mode units operating in grid parallel mode can provide customers a back-up power system with an economic return. These systems offer high on-site energy efficiency when combined with a heat exchanger (CHP) to create hot water, or with a chiller (CCHP) for air conditioning at these facilities. This configuration, when combined with our Dual Mode Controller, can transition from the grid parallel mode to prime power mode in less than 10 seconds. Our microturbines can also be installed along with a rotary UPS to provide a complete line interactive continuous power solution. In this case, the microturbines remain in grid connect mode while the rotary UPS stabilizes the utility voltage and provides a seamless transfer from operation connected to the grid to operation isolated from the grid.
 Transportation
 Our technology also can be used in hybrid electric vehicle (“HEV”) applications. Our customers have applied our products in HEV applications such as transit buses and Class 7 and 8 work trucks. In these applications, the microturbine acts as an onboard battery charger to recharge the battery system as needed. The benefits of microturbine-powered HEV hybrids include extended range, fuel economy gains, quieter operation and reduced emissions when compared with traditional internal combustion engines. Internal combustion diesel engine manufacturers have been challenged for the last several years to develop technology improvements, prior to aftertreatment that reduce emissions to levels specified by the EPA and CARB 2007 and 2010 standards. Many manufacturers are incorporating aftertreatment that increases upfront equipment costs, vehicle weight and life cycle costs, which and may reduce overall engine efficiency.

 Marine
 Our technology can also be used in marine applications. Our customers have applied our products in the commercial vessel and luxury yacht market segments. The most feasible application for our marine products is for use as a ship auxiliary generator set. In this application, the microturbines provide power to the vessel’s electrical loads and, in some cases, the vessel is able to utilize the exhaust energy to increase the overall efficiency of the application, reducing overall fuel consumption and emissions. Another feasible application is similar to our HEV application where the vessel is driven by an electric propulsion system and the microturbine serves as an on board battery charger and range extender. Our marine customers use both liquid fueled and natural gas microturbine products. Liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) is in its early stages as a marine fuel, and the number of vessels powered by LNG is forecasted to double every two years over the next decade. Vessel owners can receive the same benefits as users of stationary products: low emissions with no exhaust aftertreatment, long maintenance intervals, high reliability, low noise and no vibration. Sales and Marketing 
 We primarily sell and market our microturbine product, parts and service through our global network of authorized distributors and OEMs. Our worldwide distribution network was developed from the ground up and has become a valuable asset because we can reach end use customers globally. Each of our distributors is a strategically placed independent partner marketing and selling our products and services on our behalf. Through our global distribution network, we offer a comprehensive FPP for a fixed annual fee to perform regularly scheduled and unscheduled maintenance as needed. We provide factory and onsite training to certify all personnel that perform service on our microturbines. Individuals who are certified are called Authorized Service Providers, and must be employed by a distributor in order to perform work pursuant to a FPP. The majority of our distributors provide these services. To assure proper installation of our microturbine systems, we offer an installer training and certification program. We offer to assist all customers by reviewing their installation designs in relation to the technical requirements for proper operation of our products, such as electrical interconnections, load requirements, fuel type and pressure, cooling air flow and turbine exhaust routing. As part of the microturbine commissioning process, we also receive a checklist to confirm that the final installation adheres to our technical requirements before we accept any warranty obligations. Our typical terms of sale include shipment of the products with title, care, custody and control transferring at our dock, payment terms ranging from full payment in advance of shipment to payment in 90 days, and warranty periods of approximately 15 to 24 months from shipment depending on the product type. We typically do not have customer acceptance provisions in our agreements.

During Fiscal 2016, we launched Capstone Energy Finance, a joint venture that provides financing options for the purchase of our microturbines. Capstone Energy Finance provides end users with the ability to purchase electricity generated by our microturbine at their facility with no upfront capital investment and expand access to clean and reliable onsite energy. A power purchase agreement from Capstone Energy Finance enables organizations to reduce operating expenses by allowing them to buy electricity at a rate that is lower than what they currently pay today. Customers can purchase all or a portion of their energy from Capstone Energy Finance and eliminate exposure to volatile utility rates by locking in a fixed rate for a period of ten to twenty years. Capstone Energy Finance monitors and maintains the system for the entire term of the agreement, and customers pay only for the energy they use. We believe financing solutions offered by Capstone Energy Finance will help reverse recent trends in our sales to the oil and gas industry by allowing new and existing end users who have been impacted by low oil prices to install systems which will immediately improve their bottom line without requiring capital investment in new equipment. We are developing access to a streamlined financing solution can also be expected in the future to improve the pace of growth in the CHP market.
 United States and Canada
 We have distribution agreements with a number of companies throughout North America for the resale of our products. Many of these distributors serve multiple markets in their select geographic regions. The primary markets served in this region have been energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power and mobile products. The energy efficiency and natural resources vertical markets are expected to grow as a result of an increased domestic production of hydrocarbons, the low downstream price of natural gas, as well as public and regulatory acceptance of distributed generation.

 In developing our sales opportunities we have identified the need to address various requirements present in our target localities. These requirements include electric grid interconnection standards, gas utility connection requirements, emissions standards, building and fire safety codes and various inspections and approvals. The costs and scheduling ramifications of these various approvals, in conjunction with normal bidding process requirements and construction delays, can be significant to the completion of an installation. Our goal is to work with the applicable regulating entities to establish compliant standards for the installation of our microturbines so that the costs and installation timelines are minimized for our customers. 
 Latin America
 Our target markets in Latin America are energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural resources. Oil and gas production projects continue to be a growing market in Latin America. 
 Energy reform in Mexico, for example, has opened new market opportunities for us by allowing competition among multiple players and enabling power generation companies to sell directly to consumers instead of only to the state‑owned Federal Electricity Commission. Our strategy is to leverage our distribution network in Mexico across various market verticals. 
 South America constitutes a diverse group of markets that vary greatly in potential capture for us based on a number of factors, including availability of oil and gas production and transmission, energy pricing and political and investment climate. While we have distributors in nearly all South American countries, our management is focused on what we consider to be the top geographical markets, such as Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Ecuador. 
 Asia and Australia
 Our target markets in Asia and Australia are energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural resources. Our historical sales in Southeast Asia and Australia have primarily been in the energy efficiency and the oil and gas markets. Other areas in Asia and the Pacific Rim offer attractive opportunities as well. China is expected to see growth in the oil and gas market, while biogas recovery is showing signs of growth in Southeast Asia. Middle East and Africa
 Our target market in the Middle East and Africa is primarily oil and gas. This includes flare gas to power projects which are a particularly attractive market opportunity given the volume of gas being flared and the acute and chronic need for stable power in the region. Our management has targeted distributors and customers involved in the capture and use of flare gas in the oil and gas market. However, the geopolitical environment in this region is still volatile, which can have an impact on our sales. Europe and Russia
 To address the European market, including Russia, we are strengthening our relationships with existing and new distributors and have increased local sales and service support. We have an office in Europe for the purpose of working with our local distributors on a daily basis to identify and understand growth opportunities. We have established a spare parts distribution center in Europe to make new and remanufactured parts readily available to our distributors. Europe has a history of extensive use of distributed generation technologies. Further, the continuation or escalation of the current geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine could continue to negatively impact our operations, sales, and future growth prospects in that region.

 Competition
 The market for our products is highly competitive. Our microturbines compete with existing technologies such as reciprocating engines and compete with emerging distributed generation technologies, including solar-powered systems, wind‑powered systems, fuel cells and other microturbines. Many potential customers rely on the utility grid for their electrical power. Many of our distributed generation competitors are large, well‑established companies that derive competitive advantages from production economies of scale, worldwide presence, brand recognition and greater resources which they can devote to product development or promotion.
 Often power purchased from the electric utility grid can be less costly than power produced by distributed generation technologies. Utilities may also charge fees to interconnect to their power grids. However, we can provide economic benefits to end users in instances where the waste heat from our microturbine has value (CHP and CCHP), where fuel costs are low (renewable energy/renewable fuels), where the costs of connecting to the grid may be high or impractical (such as remote power applications), where reliability and power quality are of critical importance, or in situations where peak shaving could be economically advantageous because of highly variable electricity prices. Because our microturbines can provide a reliable source of power and can operate on multiple fuel sources, our management believes we offer a level of flexibility not currently offered by other technologies such as reciprocating engines.
 Our reciprocating engine competitors have products and markets that are well developed and technologies that have been proven for some time. A reciprocating engine, also known as an internal combustion engine, is similar to those used in automotive applications. Reciprocating engines are popular for primary and back-up power applications despite higher levels of emissions, noise and maintenance. These technologies, which in many cases have a lower up front cost than microturbines, are currently produced by, Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Inc. (which recently entered into a joint venture with Eaton), GE Gas Engines (which now includes Waukesha and Jenbacher), MAN SE, and Tecogen, Inc. (which now includes American DG Energy Inc.), among others.
 Our microturbines may also compete with other distributed generation technologies, including solar-powered systems, wind-powered systems, fuel cells and fly wheel. Solar and wind powered systems produce no emissions. The main drawbacks to solar and wind powered systems are their dependence on weather conditions, the utility grid and high capital costs that can often make these systems uneconomical without government subsidies depending upon geographic locale and application of the technology. Although the market for fuel cells is still developing, a number of companies are focused on markets similar to ours, including Active Power Inc. (a division of Piller Power Systems Inc.), Ballard Power Systems Inc., Bloom Energy Corporation, FuelCell Energy Inc., LG Fuel Cell Systems, a business unit of LG Electronics, and Plug Power Inc. Fuel cells have lower levels of NOx, CO, VOCs and other criteria pollutant emissions than our microturbines. Fuel cells, like solar and wind powered systems, historically have received higher levels of 

 
  9

 
incentives for the same type of applications as microturbines. Management believes that, absent these higher government incentives, microturbines provide a better value to end users in most applications. 
 We also compete with other companies who have microturbine products, including FlexEnergy and Turbec S.p.A.
 Overall, we compete with end users’ other options for electrical power and heat generation on the basis of our microturbine’s ability to:

  Governmental and Regulatory Impact
 Our markets can be positively or negatively impacted by the effects of governmental and regulatory matters. We are affected not only by energy policy, laws, regulations and incentives of governments in the markets in which we sell, but also by rules, regulations and costs imposed by utilities. Utility companies or governmental entities may place barriers on the installation or interconnection of our product with the electric grid. Further, utility companies may charge additional fees to customers who install on‑site power generation; thereby reducing the electricity they take from the utility, or for having the capacity to use power from the grid for back‑up or standby purposes. These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our product, or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems. This could make our systems less economical, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations. These costs, incentives and rules are not always the same as those faced by technologies with which we compete. However, rules, regulations, laws and incentives could also provide an advantage to our distributed generation solutions as compared with competing technologies if we are able to achieve required compliance in a lower cost, more efficient manner. Additionally, reduced emissions and higher fuel efficiency could help our customers combat the effects of climate change. Accordingly, we may benefit from increased government regulations that impose tighter emission and fuel efficiency standards.
 We continue to engage with federal and state policymakers to develop government programs to promote the deployment of our low emission and energy efficient products. Government funding can impact the rate of development of new technologies or improvements to existing technologies. Competing new technologies have historically received larger incentives and development funding than do microturbines. The U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) has encouraged collaboration by U.S. small businesses with national lab researchers through the Small Business Vouchers pilot program. We are one of 114 American small businesses participating in this program, which provides assistance in identifying national lab research and development activities that align with our interests.
 The Federal Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) for certain clean energy technologies, including CHP, microturbines and fuel cells among others, expired at the end of calendar year 2016. As a result, we may see an impact on our sales in the United States due to the loss of this 10% tax credit. However, other CHP and gas-fired distributed

energy technology-providers will face the same financial hurdle and the loss of the ITC would level the playing field with fuel cell technologies, which had received a 30% ITC.
 U.S. Government export promotion activities help support exports of American products to foreign markets. We participate in one of the U.S. Department of Commerce export promotion activities, Single Company Promotions, which helps us enter new markets by facilitating interactions with foreign buyers and distributors.
 Sourcing and Manufacturing
 We are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization. Our manufacturing designs include the use of conventional technology, which has been proven in high volume automotive and turbocharger production for many years. Many components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off the shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications that require longer lead time. We believe that in most cases, adequate capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time. We have an ongoing program to develop alternative back up suppliers for sole source parts wherever possible. We regularly reassess the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our future needs. We continue to evaluate and implement new systems designed to provide improved quality, reliability, service, greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs. We have substantially increased our focus on process controls and validations, supplier controls, distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality. In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to identify cost improvement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectiveness and use lean manufacturing processes. Our ability to leverage these capabilities may be affected by the current variability in our demand volumes and forecasting. Our demand volumes and forecasting could continue to be negatively impacted by the volatility of the global oil and gas markets, a strong U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and ongoing geopolitical tensions in Russia, North Africa and the Middle East. Our strategy is to identify primary and secondary sources for critical components when available to minimize production line down time due to unavailability of such parts, which could affect our ability to meet manufacturing schedules on build or a linear basis.
 Solar Turbines Incorporated (“Solar”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc., was our sole supplier of recuperator cores prior to 2001. In 2000, we exercised an option to license Solar’s technology, which allows us to manufacture these cores ourselves and we began manufacturing them in June 2001. We are required to pay a per unit royalty fee over a seventeen-year period for cores manufactured and sold by us using the technology. Royalties of approximately $32,100 and $35,000 were earned by Solar for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 In 2007, we entered into a Development and License Agreement (“Development Agreement”) with Carrier Corporation (“Carrier”) regarding the payment of royalties on the sale of each of our C200 microturbines. Carrier earned $0.9 million and $1.2 million in royalties for C200 and C1000 Series system sales during the year ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which will continue until the obsolescence of the C200 microturbine product line. 
 We have a combined total of approximately 102,000 square foot manufacturing footprint running on a single shift in the San Fernando Valley area of Southern California. We assemble and test units our C30 and C65 microturbines at our facility in Chatsworth, California. Additionally, we assemble and test our C200 and C1000 Series products and manufacture recuperator cores at our facility in Van Nuys, California. We are in the process of consolidating our manufacturing processes into our Van Nuys location. We believe that once this is complete we will have a production capacity of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix. We believe we will be able to support this production capacity level by adding additional shifts which would increase working capital requirements and making some additional capital expenditures. Additionally, once the consolidation is complete we will be looking to sublet all or a portion of our facility in Chatsworth.

 Research and Development (“R&D”)
 We have historically devoted substantial resources to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products. More recently, due to our cost reduction efforts, our focus is on expanding the existing products, including the launch of our C1000 Signature Series microturbine in December 2015. We focus our engineering efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing processes to bring our products to market in a cost-effective and timely manner. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, R&D expenses were $5.4 million and $10.2 million, respectively, which amounts are equivalent to 7% and 12% of total revenue, respectively, for these fiscal years. R&D expenses are reported net of benefits from cost‑sharing programs, such as DOE grants. There were no benefits from cost-sharing programs for Fiscal 2017. Benefits from cost‑sharing programs were $0.2 million for Fiscal 2016. Our R&D activities enabled us to become one of the first companies to develop a commercially available microturbine that operates in parallel with the grid. We were the first company to successfully demonstrate a commercially available microturbine that operates on a stand‑alone basis.
 During Fiscal 2017, we continued to make progress with our product development roadmap despite a 47% reduction in our R&D expenses compared to Fiscal 2016. Our product development activities during Fiscal 2017 included new-patented fuel injector and certification of our C65 microturbine to applicable European Union medium voltage grid interconnection standards. In addition, we continued our development in our C200S ICHP microturbine and overall cost reduction for our new Signature Series. 
 We developed a new-patented multi-staged lean pre-vaporizing, pre-mixing fuel injector providing ultra-low emissions that meet EPA Tier 4 requirements for power generation. Under this new program, exhaust emissions from these engines will be required to decrease by more than 90%. 
 Our C65, C200 and C1000 Series microturbines became Verband der Elektrotechnik (“VDE”) and Bundesverband der Energie - und Wasserwirtschaft (“BDEW”) and Comitato Electtrotecnico Italiano (“CEI”) certified during Fiscal 2017. These new standards were attained following the development and implementation of new microturbine system software architecture. 
 The C200S microturbine incorporates numerous system and design upgrades intended to improve overall product quality, reliability, and performance. Our new C200S ICHP product further supports our effort to diversify our business into the CHP and CCHP energy efficiency markets, and the new roof mounted integrated CHP heat recovery modules designed specifically for our new Signature Series product we aim to add additional revenue opportunities.
 We developed new partnerships with the DOE in Fiscal 2017, whereby, the DOE will provide funding in the amount of $335,000 for one year to Argonne National Laboratory to conduct hydrogen and synthetic fuel or syngas testing on our C65 and C200 microturbines. The new fuel injection technology could enable our microturbines to run on an expanded range of fuels that are not currently widely used, but have the potential to be a source of power generation with widely varying compositions, such as gasified industrial waste streams. In addition, we continued progress on our flexible fuels program, with recent successful testing on butane. 
 We partnered with FGC Plasma Solutions to test a new plasma-assisted fuel injection technology in our C65 microturbine. We work together to develop a new combustion concept for improved turbine efficiency and emissions performance. The technology will enable more optimum operation of the engine as well as benefits from lower emissions, increased fuel flexibility and improved reliability. Testing will be held at Argonne National Laboratory.

During Fiscal 2016, we unveiled our C1000 Signature (“C1000S’) microturbine as part of our new C1000S microturbine energy systems which also includes an 800kW (“C800S”) or 600kW (“C600S”) microturbine. The C1000S microturbine incorporates over 70 components, system and design upgrades intended to improve the overall product quality and enhance the microturbine ownership experience in all applications but specifically for CHP and CCHP applications. A few of the key upgrades include integrated heat recovery for CHP and CCHP applications, two-stage air filtration system, improved enclosure, relocated engine exhaust stack and redesigned discharge for enclosure cooling air. The C1000S is one of the worlds most integrated and compact 1MW CHP solutions. The 8-foot wide by 30-foot long

1MW power plant reaches approximately 82% total system efficiency and is significantly quieter than the original C1000 for installation in low-noise urban environments.
 In addition, we continue to work both cost reduction and performance enhancement activities to improve the value of our microturbine products for our customer base. Cost reduction activities are focused on leveraging the capabilities of our supply base and internal design lean manufacturing improvements. Product enhancements are focused on reducing the already very low maintenance requirements for our products, while at the same time improving operational efficiency, thereby reducing our customers’ total cost of ownership. 
 Because of our single moving assembly, manufacturers believe there is also the opportunity to produce a lower cost product in larger automotive volumes. Our focus is on a next generation product that would include existing components and a liquid‑cooled set of electronics that are consistent with the size, cost and cooling strategies employed on vehicles today. Although we believe the hybrid electric bus and truck market has the potential to be a beneficial option for the bus and truck manufacturers, we temporarily suspended our development efforts with respect to C30 microturbines targeted at this market in response to our lower revenue. Management intends to continue with the next phase of development after we achieve profitability.
 We are working with the Kenworth Truck Company to demonstrate a Class 7 series hybrid delivery truck with funding support from the South Coast Air Quality Management District and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. This truck will be operated on actual customer delivery routes in both air districts to quantify the performance, emissions, fuel economy, and other benefits of a microturbine‑based hybrid solution. The Kenworth Class 7 hybrid truck is retrofitted with a refrigerated box body and should be ready for track testing at Kenworth facilities in the second half of 2017. The truck will then be used in a demonstration phase to a large commercial customer within the San Joaquin Valley in California. We expect to collect and utilize information from the Kenworth Class 7 hybrid truck’s road testing and demonstration processes for future product developments and enhancements. A prototype or concept vehicle may take several years to go into commercial production following completion of rigorous testing. 
 Our liquid fuel microturbines have demonstrated emissions levels which meet the CARB 2010 standards for Heavy Duty Diesel Engines (“HDDE”). The liquid fuel microturbine is able to meet these extremely low emissions requirements using its lean premix combustion technology with no exhaust aftertreatment. Competitive reciprocating engine technologies require aftertreatment components that increase system cost, require frequent maintenance, and impact engine efficiency. Our compressed natural gas (“CNG”) fueled microturbines also meet extremely low emission standards, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and CARB 2010 emissions requirements for On‑Road HDDE for Urban Bus. Test emissions from our natural gas microturbines measured dramatically less than the emissions levels set forth by the CARB standard including NOx at 75% and CO at 96% less than the required levels. 
 Our marine products may be used to provide hybrid electric marine propulsion, “hotel power,” CHP, or CCHP. They may be ideal for small and mid-size commercial ships that travel inland waterways and emissions controlled areas (“ECAs”). Although we believe the marine sector has the potential to be a beneficial option for the vessel owners, we temporarily suspended our development efforts with respect to C30 microturbines targeted at this market in response to our lower revenue. We currently intend to continue with the next phase of development after we achieve profitability. 
 Our C65 Hybrid UPS product line has been evolving over the years. After having received the 2011 NOVA Award from the Construction Innovation Forum for the C65 Hybrid UPS Microturbine at Syracuse University’s data center—labeled one of the greenest data centers in the world, our C65 Hybrid UPS system has continued development and has recent installations at Sempra in Monterey Park, California and our own data center in Chatsworth, California. The product utilizes our inverter electronics and controls technology to provide continuous power quality to meet the customer’s critical load. The load inverter is connected through a central power bus to provide power from one of three available power sources including the utility grid, battery storage system, or microturbine generator. Power to the critical load is synchronized to an available utility grid to allow direct bypass of the critical load to the utility grid. This redundant functionality is provided in a single integrated package that can be scaled to a larger seamless power unit through our multipack feature. These units can also be combined with a heat recovery module or an absorption chiller to provide higher total output efficiency. Unlike current UPS products combined with reciprocating engines for backup, our

low emissions Hybrid UPS product allows for continuous operation year-round allowing customers the ability to receive a payback on their capital equipment investment. Although we believe the industrial UPS market has the potential to be a beneficial option for businesses that require constant supply of reliable energy, we temporarily suspended our development efforts with respect to C65 microturbines targeted at this market in response to our lower revenue. We currently intend to continue with the next phase of development after we achieve profitability.
 We are working with the DOE on two next generation technology roadmap programs, including a High Efficiency Microturbine with integrated heat recovery and advanced Alumina Forming Austenitic (“AFA”) stainless steel material program in partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (“ORNL”). The High Efficiency Microturbine with integrated heat recovery is focused on improving microturbine electrical efficiency and overall system efficiency utilizing heat recovery. In March 2013, we successfully completed proof‑of‑concept testing of the low pressure spool also known as the C250 that produced >270 kW as part of the first phase of development. This allowed us to proceed with high pressure spool development which was completed during Fiscal 2016. We also demonstrated an increased capability of the power electronics and electrical system required to support this higher power generator. We intend to continue with the next phase of development and commercialization after we achieve profitability. The next phase will be to continue development of the C250 product architecture as well as the associated power electronics and software controls required for successful commercialization. The final phase of the program will incorporate further engine efficiency improvements, resulting in a product design with a projected electrical efficiency of 42% and targeted power output of 370 kW. Improvements in efficiency are key to all markets as improved fuel efficiency benefits end users through lower operating costs. AFA stainless steel is a material that offers superior oxidation and creep resistance to commercial heat‑resistant steel alloys used in our microturbines at a significantly reduced cost. In Fiscal 2015, we successfully completed the first of two long term endurance tests and have engaged industry partners on commercialization viability. 
 Protecting our Intellectual Property Rights and Patents
 We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, “know how”, and trademark laws and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our products. In this regard, we have obtained 98 U.S. and 27 international patents (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions). The patents we have obtained will expire between 2017 and 2035. We actively evaluate our patent portfolio and pursue new patent applications as we develop new technological innovations, as needed.
 We believe that a policy of protecting intellectual property is one component of our strategy of being the leader in microturbine system technology and will provide us with a long term competitive advantage. In addition, we implement security procedures at our plants and facilities and have confidentiality agreements with our suppliers, distributors, employees and certain visitors to our facilities.
 Organization and Employees
 We were organized in 1988 in the State of California, our company was reincorporated as Capstone Turbine Corporation on June 22, 2000 in the State of Delaware.
 As of March 31, 2017, we had 168 full-time employees. No employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements. We consider relations with our employees to be moderate to good after the Fiscal 2017 reductions in force. Available Information
