ITEM 1. | Business

Overview 
Caesars Entertainment is a casino-entertainment and hospitality services provider with the world’s most diversified portfolio and facilities in more areas throughout the United States than any other participant in the gaming industry. We have established a rich history of industry-leading growth and expansion since we commenced operations in 1937. Our facilities typically include gaming offerings, food and beverage outlets, hotel and convention space, and non-gaming entertainment options. In addition to our brick and mortar assets, we operate an online gaming business that provides real money games in certain jurisdictions.
CEC is primarily a holding company with no independent operations of its own. CEC operates the business primarily through its wholly owned subsidiaries CEOC, LLC (“CEOC LLC”) and Caesars Resort Collection, LLC (“CRC”).
Significant Events and Transactions in 2017
Transactions Related to CAC Merger and CEOC’s Emergence from Bankruptcy
Merger with Caesars Acquisition Company
In 2014, CEC and Caesars Acquisition Company (“CAC”) entered into a merger agreement, which was amended and restated in July 2016 and February 2017 (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on October 6, 2017 (the “Effective Date”), CAC merged with and into CEC, with CEC as the surviving company (the “CAC Merger”), and each share of CAC common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date was converted into, and became exchangeable for, 1.625 shares of CEC common stock on the Effective Date, which resulted in the issuance of 226 million shares of CEC common stock to the stockholders of CAC. See Note 4 for additional information.
CEOC’s Emergence from Bankruptcy and Acquisition of OpCo
In addition, on the Effective Date, Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc. (“CEOC”) and certain of its United States subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) emerged from bankruptcy. CEC made material financial commitments to support the reorganization of CEOC, as described in the Debtors’ third amended joint plan of reorganization (the “Plan”). The total value of the consideration that was provided by CEC as of the Effective Date was $8.6 billion and included a combination of cash, shares of CEC common stock, and $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.00% convertible senior notes maturing in 2024 (the “CEC Convertible Notes”). See Note 1 for additional information.
As part of its emergence from bankruptcy, CEOC reorganized into an operating company (“OpCo”) and PropCo. PropCo holds certain real property assets formerly held by CEOC and leases those assets to OpCo. See Note 10 for additional information. PropCo is a separate entity that is not consolidated by Caesars and, on the Effective Date, was sold to VICI Properties Inc., the real estate investment trust that was initially owned by certain former creditors of CEOC and is independent from CEC.
OpCo was acquired by CEC on the Effective Date for total consideration of $2.5 billion, which included a combination of cash and CEC common stock. OpCo operates the properties and facilities formerly held by CEOC and leases the properties and facilities from VICI. Upon acquisition, OpCo was immediately merged with and into CEOC LLC, with CEOC LLC as the surviving entity. See Note 4 for additional information.
3

As part of the acquisition of OpCo, we assumed $1.2 billion in debt that was issued in connection with CEOC’s emergence from bankruptcy. See Note 12 for additional information.
Hamlet Holdings
The members of Hamlet Holdings LLC (“Hamlet Holdings”) are comprised of affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC (“Apollo”) and affiliates of TPG Global, LLC (“TPG”) (collectively, the “Sponsors”). Hamlet Holdings contributed to CEC the 88 million shares of CEC common stock it owned prior to the CAC Merger, which CEC immediately canceled and retired. Hamlet Holdings controlled CEC prior to the CAC Merger. Upon completion of the CAC Merger and CEOC’s emergence from bankruptcy, Hamlet Holdings beneficially owned approximately 20.8% of CEC common stock as a result of its former interest in CAC, and consequently, Hamlet Holdings no longer controls CEC.
CRC Merger and Related Debt Transactions
On October 16, 2017, CRC Escrow Issuer, LLC (“Escrow Issuer”) and CRC Finco, Inc. (“Finance”), two wholly owned, indirect subsidiaries of CEC, issued $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2025 (the “CRC Notes”). CRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of CEC, was created on December 22, 2017, with the merger of Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties, LLC (“CERP”) into Caesars Growth Properties Holdings, LLC (“CGPH”) (the “CRC Merger”). In conjunction with the CRC Merger, Escrow Issuer merged with and into CRC, with CRC as the surviving entity and borrower.
Additionally, on December 22, 2017, CRC entered into new senior secured credit facilities comprised of (i) a $1.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility (the “CRC Revolving Credit Facility”) and (ii) a $4.7 billion senior secured term loan credit facility (the “CRC Term Loan Facility”). The net proceeds of the CRC Notes and the CRC Term Loan Facility, as well as available cash and borrowings under the CRC Revolving Credit Facility, were used to repay the outstanding debt of CERP and CGPH. See Note 12 for additional information.
Other Events and Transactions
As of August 31, 2017, CR Baltimore Holdings, which indirectly owns the Horseshoe Baltimore Casino (“Horseshoe Baltimore”), was deconsolidated and is accounted for as an equity method investment subsequent to the deconsolidation. See Note 2 for additional information.
On November 16, 2017, we announced it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Centaur Holdings, LLC (“Centaur”) for $1.7 billion, including $1.6 billion in cash at closing and $75 million in deferred consideration. Centaur operates Hoosier Park Racing & Casino in Anderson, Indiana, and Indiana Grand Racing & Casino in Shelbyville, Indiana. The transaction is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of 2018.
On December 22, 2017, we sold the real estate assets of Harrah’s Las Vegas for approximately $1.1 billion as part of a sale and leaseback transaction with VICI. See Note 1 and Note 10 for additional information.
On December 22, 2017, we acquired approximately 18 acres of land adjacent to Harrah’s Las Vegas (the “Eastside Land”) for $74 million in cash. We intend to use the Eastside Land as part of a new convention center development featuring approximately 300,000 square feet of flexible meeting space. See Note 1 for additional information.
Organizational Structure
As of December 31, 2017, through our consolidated entities, we operate 47 casino properties in 13 U.S. states and 4 countries outside of the United States. Our facilities had an aggregate of over 2.8 million square feet of gaming space and approximately 39,000 hotel rooms. Of the 47 casinos, 35 were in the United States and primarily consist of land-based and riverboat or dockside casinos. Our 12 international casinos are land-based casinos, most of which are located in the United Kingdom. 
We view each casino property as an operating segment and aggregate them into three regionally-focused reportable segments: (i) Las Vegas, (ii) Other U.S., and (iii) All Other, which is consistent with how we manage the business. Within these segments, our properties are primarily categorized as Leased (where we lease real property assets from VICI), Owned-Domestic, Owned-International, and Managed. See Item 2, “Properties,” for more information about our properties.
Our All Other segment includes managed and international properties as well as other businesses, such as Caesars Interactive Entertainment (“CIE”).

Business Operations
Our consolidated business is composed of five complementary businesses that reinforce, cross-promote, and build upon each other: casino entertainment, food and beverage, rooms and hotel, casino management services, and entertainment and other business operations.
Casino Entertainment Operations
Our casino entertainment operations generate revenues from approximately 36,000 slot machines and 2,700 table games, as well as other games such as keno, poker, and race and sports books, all of which comprised approximately 52% of our total net revenues in 2017. Slot revenues generate the majority of our gaming revenues, particularly in our properties located outside of Las Vegas and Atlantic City. We are testing a number of skill-based games as we implement product offerings intended to appeal to all demographics, and we expect to expand these offerings as required regulatory approvals are obtained. 
Food and Beverage Operations
Our food and beverage operations generate revenues from over 150 buffets, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and lounges located throughout our casinos, as well as banquets and room service, and represented approximately 17% of our total net revenues in 2017. Many of our properties include several dining options, ranging from upscale dining experiences to moderately-priced restaurants and buffets.
Rooms and Hotel Operations
Rooms and hotel operations generate revenues from hotel stays at our casino properties in our approximately 36,000 guest rooms and suites worldwide and represented approximately 19% of our total net revenues in 2017. Our properties operate at various price and service points, allowing us to host a variety of casino guests who are visiting our properties for gaming and other casino entertainment options and non-casino guests who are visiting our properties for other purposes, such as vacation travel or conventions.
We have engaged in large capital reinvestment projects in recent years focusing primarily on our room product across the United States, including renovating nearly 11,000 rooms in Las Vegas since 2014 at properties such as Caesars Palace, The LINQ Hotel & Casino and Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino (“Planet Hollywood”). In addition, we continue the roll out of self-check-in kiosks in order to help reduce customer wait times and improve labor efficiencies.
Casino Management Services
We earn revenue from fees paid for the management of eight casinos. Managed properties represent Caesars-branded properties where Caesars Entertainment provides staffing and management services under management agreements.
Entertainment and Other Business Operations
We provide a variety of retail and entertainment offerings in our casinos and The LINQ Promenade. We offer various entertainment venues across the United States, including the Colosseum at Caesars Palace and Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood, both of which were ranked among the top theater venues in the United States in 2017 based on ticket sales. These award-winning theaters have hosted prominent headliners, such as Celine Dion, the Backstreet Boys, and Jennifer Lopez.
The LINQ Promenade and our retail stores offer guests a wide range of options from high-end brands and accessories to souvenirs and decorative items. The LINQ Promenade is an open-air dining, entertainment, and retail development located between The LINQ Hotel & Casino and Flamingo Las Vegas, and it features The High Roller, a 550-foot observation wheel.
In addition, CIE operates a regulated online real money gaming business in Nevada and New Jersey and owns the World Series of Poker (“WSOP”) tournaments and brand, and also licenses WSOP trademarks for a variety of products and businesses related to this brand.
Sales and Marketing
We believe our customer loyalty program Total Rewards enables us to capture a larger share of our customers’ entertainment spending when they travel among regions versus that of a standalone property, which is core to our cross market strategy. We believe that operating multiple properties in the center of the Las Vegas Strip generates greater revenues than would be generated if the properties were operated separately.
5

We believe Total Rewards, in conjunction with this distribution system, enables us to capture a larger share of our customers’ entertainment spending and compete more effectively. Members who have joined Total Rewards can earn Reward Credits for qualifying gaming activity and qualifying hotel, dining and retail spending at all Caesars-affiliated properties in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Members can also earn additional Reward Credits when they use their Total Rewards VISA credit card or make a purchase through a Total Rewards partner. Members can redeem their earned Reward Credits with Caesars for hotel amenities, casino free play and other items such as merchandise, gift cards, and travel.
Total Rewards is structured in tiers (designated as Gold, Platinum, Diamond or Seven Stars), each with increasing member benefits and privileges. Members are provided promotional offers based on their Tier Level, their engagement with Caesars-affiliated properties, aspects of their casino gaming play, and their preferred spending choices outside of gaming. Member information is also used in connection with various marketing promotions, including campaigns involving direct mail, email, our websites, mobile devices, social media, and interactive slot machines.
Intellectual Property
The development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy. We regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success. While our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one patent, trademark, copyright, or combination of several of our intellectual property rights, we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations and technology through the use of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret laws. We file applications for and obtain patents, trademarks, and copyrights in the United States and foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate, including United States and foreign patent applications covering certain proprietary technology of Caesars Enterprise Services, LLC (“CES”). We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. CES’ United States patents have varying expiration dates, the last of which is 2031.
We have not applied for the registration of all of our trademarks, copyrights, proprietary technology, or other intellectual property rights, as the case may be, and may not be successful in obtaining all intellectual property rights for which we have applied. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe upon our intellectual property and use information that we regard as proprietary, and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights or intellectual property to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. In addition, others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property.
We own or have the right to use proprietary rights to a number of trademarks that we consider, along with the associated name recognition, to be valuable to our business, including Bally’s, Caesars, Flamingo, Harrah’s, Horseshoe, Paris, Rio, Total Rewards, WSOP, and a license for the Planet Hollywood trademark used in connection with the Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas.
Competition
The casino entertainment business is highly competitive. The industry is comprised of a diverse group of competitors that vary considerably in size and geographic diversity, quality of facilities and amenities available, marketing and growth strategies, and financial condition. In most regions, we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding areas. In Las Vegas, our largest jurisdiction, competition has increased significantly. For example, the Genting Group is developing a casino and hotel called Resorts World Las Vegas and Marriott International and New York-based global real estate firm Witkoff are developing a casino and hotel called The Drew Las Vegas. Both are expected to open in 2020 on the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip. Further, Wynn Resorts has begun construction on Wynn Paradise Park adjacent to its existing property and announced plans for a Wynn West casino and hotel property. In response to changing trends, Las Vegas operators have been focused on expanding their non-gaming offerings, including upgrades to hotel rooms, new food and beverage offerings, and new entertainment offerings. In June 2016, MGM announced that the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino will undergo $450 million in non-gaming renovations focused on room, food and beverage and entertainment enhancements and is expected to re-open in late 2018 as two newly branded hotels. There have also been proposals for other large scale non-gaming development projects in Las Vegas by various other developers. Our Las Vegas Strip hotels and casinos also compete, in part, with each other.
In recent years, many casino operators, including us, have been reinvesting in existing facilities, developing new casinos or complementary facilities, and acquiring established facilities. These reinvestment and expansion efforts combined with aggressive marketing strategies by us and many of our competitors have resulted in increased competition in many regions. As companies have completed new expansion projects, supply has typically grown at a faster pace than demand in some areas. For example, in Baltimore, Maryland, the opening of MGM Resorts National Harbor Resort & Casino has resulted in significant declines in revenue at our Horseshoe Baltimore property. The expansion of casino properties and entertainment venues into new jurisdictions also presents competitive issues. Atlantic City, in particular, has seen a significant decline primarily due to the addition of gaming and 
6

room capacity associated with the expansion of gaming in Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania. This has resulted in several casino closings in recent years.
Our properties also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on Native American tribal lands. While the competitive impact on operations in Las Vegas from the continued growth of Native American gaming establishments in California remains uncertain, the proliferation of gaming in California and other areas located in the same regions as our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, certain states have legalized, and others may legalize, casino gaming in specific areas, including metropolitan areas from which we traditionally attract customers.
We also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, various other entertainment businesses, and other forms of gaming, such as state lotteries, on-and off-track wagering, video lottery terminals, and card parlors. Our non-gaming offerings also compete with other retail facilities, amusement attractions, food and beverage offerings, and entertainment venues. While we do not believe it to be the case, some have suggested that internet gaming could also create additional competition for us and could adversely affect our brick-and-mortar operations. We believe that internet gaming complements brick-and-mortar operations.
See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” See also Exhibit 99.1, “Gaming Overview,” to this Form 10-K. In addition, for a summary of key developments in 2017, see “Summary of Significant Events” in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Seasonality
We believe that business at our regional properties outside of Las Vegas is subject to seasonality, including seasonality based on the weather in the markets in which they operate and the travel habits of visitors. Business in our properties can also fluctuate due to specific holidays or other significant events, such as Easter (particularly when the holiday falls in a different quarter than the prior year), the World Series of Poker tournament (with respect to our Las Vegas properties), city-wide conventions, a large sporting event or a concert, or visits by our premium players. We also believe that any seasonality, holiday, or other significant event may affect our various properties or regions differently.
Governmental Regulation
The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules, and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws, rules, and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1, “Gaming Overview,” to this Form 10-K.
Our businesses are subject to various foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, construction, land use, and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for additional discussion.

Employee Relations
We have approximately 65,000 employees throughout our organization. Approximately 28,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with certain of our subsidiaries relating to certain casino, hotel, and restaurant employees. The majority of these employees are covered by the following agreements:

Employee Group | Approximate Number of Active Employees Represented | Union | Date on which Collective Bargaining Agreement Becomes Amendable
Las Vegas Culinary Employees | 13,000 | Culinary Workers Union, Local 226 | Various up to July 31, 2018 
Atlantic City Food & Beverage and Hotel Employees | 3,500 | UNITE HERE, Local 54 | February 28, 2020 
Las Vegas Bartenders | 1,600 | Bartenders Union, Local 165 | Various up to July 31, 2018 
Las Vegas Dealers | 3,900 | Transport Workers Union of America and UAW | Various up toSeptember 30, 2019 

Corporate Citizenship, Social Responsibility and Sustainability
CEC’s Board of Directors the (“Board”) and senior executives are committed to maintaining our position as an industry leader in corporate citizenship, corporate social responsibility, and sustainability. In 2017, we continued to engage with our CEO-level external environmental sustainability advisory board with experts representing non-governmental organizations, business strategy, academia, and investors, and used their guidance to confirm our citizenship priorities. These priorities are reflected in our eighth annual citizenship report, published in 2017 in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative Standards. 
In 2017, we also launched our new corporate citizenship framework under the branded theme of People Planet Play. This approach unites all our properties and business activities behind a common language to more effectively support sustainable and ethical profitable business growth:

• | People: supporting the wellbeing of our team members, guests and local communities.


• | Planet: caring for our planet so our guests don’t need to worry.


• | Play: creating memorable experiences for our guests and leading Responsible Gaming practices in the industry.

We introduced targets to 2020 and 2030 across all elements of People Planet Play, including science-based emissions-reduction targets, aligning with global best practices on climate change action. We enjoy strong support from our team members for People Planet Play activities, with 46% of team members participating in our HERO volunteering and/or CodeGreen environmental programs in 2016. Additionally, we aim to raise awareness and gain support from our guests for People Planet Play initiatives. In 2016, guest perception improved in that 59% strongly agreed that our company made a positive impact in economic development, responsible gaming, environmental impact and overall responsible conduct (versus 55% in 2015).
Code of Commitment
Our Code of Commitment to our employees, guests and communities has guided our approach to responsible and ethical business, compliance, anti-corruption and whistleblower processes. Training reinforces our expectations of all employees. Caesars was the first company to develop responsible gaming programs informed by science, evaluated objectively and created in conjunction with leading researchers. All of our gaming offerings are underpinned by comprehensive Responsible Gaming programs that provide advice for those who need it (see more on our website: http://caesarscorporate.com/about-caesars/responsible-gaming/) with fully trained team members. In 2016, team members participated in 64,700 hours of training in Responsible Gaming. 
Over the past several years, with the engagement and support of the Board, we have further intensified our anti-money-laundering (“AML”) compliance activities. We doubled the number of qualified staff in dedicated AML compliance roles to around 90 experts by the middle of 2016 and approved more than $5 million in technology investments to implement new systems to improve transparency and information sharing within the Company, increase automation and enhance analytics, all to ensure we are an industry leader when it comes to AML compliance.
8

For the third year running, we were recognized on the Civic 50, an initiative organized by Points of Light and Bloomberg that recognizes companies for their commitment to improving the quality of life in their home communities. In 2016, we reconfirmed our support for the UN Sustainable Development Goals and highlighted three goals where we can make the most significant contribution and expand our impact in coming years.

• | #3: Good Health And Well-Being


• | #8: Decent Work And Economic Growth


• | #11: Sustainable Cities And Communities

Environmental Stewardship
Our structured, data-driven CodeGreen strategy leverages the passion of our team members and engages our guests and suppliers. 
In 2017, we set a science-based target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2025 (over a 2011 baseline). Between 2007 and 2016, we reduced energy consumption across our U.S. and international properties by 21% and greenhouse gas emissions by 34% (against the U.S. only baseline year, 2007). Since 2008, we have reduced water consumption by 20%. In 2016, 43% of our total waste in North America was diverted from landfill, bringing our cumulative waste diversion from landfill to 268,900 tons since 2012.
In 2017, 100% of owned or managed North American hotel resort properties achieved a 4 Green Key rating or higher. Recently recognized by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council, Green Key is a rigorous program that ranks, certifies and inspects hotels and resorts based on their commitment to sustainable operations. Green Key uses a rating system of 1 to 5 Keys, with 5 being the highest possible attainment.
For our work in disclosure of our environmental impacts, Caesars Entertainment received an “A” score for water impact and A- in carbon reporting from the formerly named Carbon Disclosure Project (“CDP”), an international not-for-profit that drives sustainable economies. Thousands of companies submit annual disclosures to CDP for independent assessment against its scoring methodology. We joined the A List for Water for the first time this year and are among 10% of companies participating in CDP’s water program to receive this honor.
In order to both enhance our offerings and engage guests in our citizenship efforts, we have branded our hotel rooms with our citizenship messaging under the theme of People Planet Play, inviting guests to play a role by using water, air-conditioning and towels with the environment in mind. We promote sustainable sourcing of key food ingredients for our menus from sustainably managed farms and fisheries, in response to the growing number of consumers who value such options. Additionally, to address concerns from animal rights groups, we have committed to source cage-free eggs across all our properties by 2025.
Diversity, Inclusion, and Employee Wellbeing
We seek to create a dynamic and innovative working culture where individual growth is rewarded, recognized, and celebrated. Caesars is the only company in the casino entertainment industry to receive perfect scores on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index for eleven consecutive years, including 2018. We encourage diversity and the advancement of women, and in 2016, 37% of our manager level employees belonged to minority groups and 44% were women. In November 2017, we announced our goal to achieve gender equity in management by 2025. This initiative embodies Caesars’ commitment to identifying, hiring, developing, and retaining great talent. This will enable our organization to be best in class, be more innovative, make better decisions, and better reflect our diverse clients and communities. Our Employee Wellness Program, includes 26 nurses and coaches across our properties. The program demonstrates results each year with improved health metrics for participating employees, and insurance savings for Caesars through lower health risk.
Community Investment
Caesars Entertainment consistently makes significant contributions to our local communities to help them develop and prosper. We do this through funding of community projects, employee volunteering hours and cash donations from the Caesars Foundation (a private foundation funded by a portion of our operating income and has gifted more than $74 million since its inception in 2002). In 2017, we contributed a total of $63 million to communities through all these channels, including 331,000 reported employee volunteer hours.
