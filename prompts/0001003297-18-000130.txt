  ITEM 1.          BUSINESS
  First Hartford Corporation, which was incorporated in Maine in 1909, and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”), is engaged in two business segments: 1) the purchase, development, ownership, management and sale of real estate and 2) providing preferred developer services for two corporate franchise operators (i.e., “Fee for Service”).
Business Narrative:
  First business segment:
  The principal activity of the Company’s first segment of business is the purchase, development, ownership, management and sale of real estate.  The real estate, owned and/or managed by the Company through various subsidiaries and joint ventures, is located in Connecticut, Delaware, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Texas.  Non-residential tenants are obtained through brokers and employed representatives of the Company, by means of Industry Trade Shows, direct contacts with retail stores and other potential commercial tenants, and an occasional inquiry by potential tenants at the Company’s on-site offices.  Residential tenants are obtained through advertisements and inquiry at on-site offices.
  The Company has a comprehensive investment strategy when it comes to new projects or acquisitions.  Before investing, the Company conducts comprehensive due diligence that includes researching demographics, traffic, nearby vacancies, competition, and nearby market conditions.  After a potential investment has been fully vetted, a decision is made.
  The Company’s real estate business is diversified by geographical locations, type of commercial property, and form of ownership or management.  The commercial real estate business is not divided further into significant separate classes of products or services.
  When profitable opportunities arise, the Company will buy and sell certain properties.
  The only facilities the Company owns and operates are a movie theater and a liquor store at one of its properties and a restaurant at another one of its properties.  In all other cases, the tenants of the Company’s properties are third-parties.

  Second business segment:
  The principal activity of the Company’s second segment of business is providing preferred developer services to CVS Health (CVS) and Cumberland Farms Inc. in certain geographic areas.
  CVS: The Company has an agreement with CVS to be a preferred developer in Texas within the Rio Grande Valley and Houston, in New York within Long Island and portions of Rockland County, in New Jersey, in most of Connecticut, and in Louisiana.  This is a fee for service agreement by which the Company will locate a site, negotiate a letter of intent, prepare store development budgets, demographics, arrange traffic counts and submit for CVS Real Estate Committee approval.  Once so approved, the Company will negotiate a purchase or lease of such property and obtain permits.  The Company will invoice 75% of the total fee when the property is purchased or leased, and a building permit is issued.  Fees vary based on location and style of the store.  A CVS pre-qualified third party contractor is selected who will work through the Company.  The Company will manage the construction and administrate the contracts and payments.  When a Certificate of Occupancy is obtained, the Company will invoice 15% of the total fee.  After the store is opened and all the open construction items are completed, the Company will invoice the final 10% of the total fee. Income is recognized as required services, as outlined in the development agreement, are completed.  The entire process will normally take 1-3 years. The volume of revenue from this fee for service agreement is in excess of 10% of the Company’s annual revenue (excluding sales of real estate).  The loss of the CVS contract would have a material adverse effect on the revenues and operations of the Company.

 ITEM 1.          BUSINESS (concluded):
  Cumberland Farms: The Company is also a preferred developer for Cumberland Farms Inc. within Connecticut, New York, and Western Massachusetts. Its scope of work is less than the CVS arrangement above as the Company is not involved in the construction management of the store.  This is a fee for service agreement by which the Company will locate a site, negotiate a letter of intent, prepare store development budgets, demographics, arrange traffic counts and submit for Cumberland Farms Real Estate Committee approval.  Once so approved, the Company will negotiate a purchase or lease of such property and obtain state and local approval and associated permits for construction.  The Company will invoice 100% of the total fee when the property is purchased or leased and a building permit is issued. Income is recognized as required services, as outlined in the development agreement, are completed.  The entire process will normally take 1-2 years.  The loss of the Cumberland Farms contract would have a material adverse effect on the revenues and operations of the Company.

  Miscellaneous Business Reporting:
  The Company does not produce or offer any products, and as such, it has no foreign operations, no inventory (except small amounts at the liquor store and restaurant), and does not export products or services. Its present business segments are not seasonal in nature.  The Company does not have any patents, licenses, franchises, concessions, or royalty agreements.  The Company is not conducting any research and development.  The Company's subsidiaries involved with residential rental properties have some contracts or subcontracts, including loans, with the United States government via Housing & Urban Development (HUD).  
  The Company’s operations and property are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and human health safety.  There is no significant environmental litigation involving any of the Company’s properties.  
  The Company has a backlog, or pipeline, of potential development projects with CVS and Cumberland Farms.  The Company does not believe backlog is a useful measure of past performance or continuing performance because the life of each project ranges from one to three years and the number of future projects is not predictable.
  The Company’s economic performance and the value of its real estate are subject to the risks incidental to the development, construction and ownership of real estate properties, as well as the economic well-being of its tenants.
  Employment: On April 30, 2018, the Company employed 111 people full-time and 89 people part-time.
  Competition: The Company competes with many other established companies and entities, many of which are larger and possess substantially greater financial resources and substantially larger staffs.
