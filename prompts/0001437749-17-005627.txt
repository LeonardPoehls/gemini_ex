We sell our products into two target markets: Connected Smart TV Platforms and IoT Devices. Connected Smart TV Platforms products consist of a range of platforms that are based on highly integrated chips, embedded software, and hardware reference designs. These products include all of our products that are sold into digital televisions, connected media processors and players delivering IP streaming video, including hybrid versions of these products, and wired home networking controller chipsets that are designed to provide connectivity solutions between various home entertainment products and incoming video streams. IoT Devices consist of our wireless Z-Wave chipsets, modules and mobile IoT cellular solutions.
 
Starting with the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we have combined certain target markets commensurate with changes taking effect in our industry as a whole. Specifically, we combined the Smart TV, Media Connectivity and Set-top Box markets into one target market, which we refer to as the Connected Smart TV Platforms target market. This target market is intended to include all of our products sold into or supporting the digital television experience including products designed for video-post processing, delivering of IP streaming video, audio, VoIP, or data and the equipment intended to connect these various home entertainment products. We have historically and continue to operate under the belief that the Smart TV, Set-top Box and Media Connectivity products complement their respective value propositions to the markets into which we sell. This combination is intended to present this value proposition as a holistic solution or platform for the anticipated convergence of IP-video, audio and data delivery across any device within the connected home. All previously reported amounts in prior periods have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect our target market changes. Our IoT Devices market product categorizations remain unchanged, and beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 reflects the operations resulting from our acquisition of Bretelon, Inc. (“Bretelon”).
 
Products
 
Media Processor 
 
Our media processor product line consists of a range of functionally similar platforms that are based on highly integrated chips, embedded software, and hardware reference designs. These highly integrated chips typically include all the functions required to create a complete system solution with only the addition of memory. The integrated functions include application processing (“CPU”), graphics processing (“GPU”), media processing (audio and video decoding/encoding), display processing, security management, memory control, and peripheral interfaces. Our embedded software suite provides an operating environment and coordinates the real-time processing of digital video and audio content, is readily customizable by our customers and is interoperable with multiple standard operating systems. Our reference system designs provide a hardware implementation of the circuit board, access to our embedded software suite, and can include prototypes for customer evaluation and use. We believe our products deliver industry-leading performance in video decoding, picture quality, and software breadth, and this value proposition is why manufacturers select our products.
 
Our chipsets are generally configured for either the smart television (“Smart TV”) or streaming set-top box, the latter of which includes related products, such as connected media players. Chipsets created for Smart TV obtain inputs from high definition multimedia interface (“HDMI”) and analog video and provide outputs to flat panel interfaces. Chipsets created for the Set-top Box obtain inputs from Ethernet and other broadcast interfaces and provide output to HDMI and analog video. Core components are therefore shared across these products while their configured hardware/software platforms and support are offered separately.
 
Media Connectivity Controllers
 
Our Media Connectivity product line consists of wired home networking controller chipsets that are designed to provide connectivity solutions between various home entertainment products and incoming video streams. We believe these connectivity solutions provide consumers additional connectivity choices with increased flexibility and reliability and allow system integrators and service providers an opportunity to reduce the time and cost of home networking installations. Our Media Connectivity solutions are based on the HomePNA (“HPNA”), HomePlug AV (“HPAV”), and G.hn standards.  HPNA is a standard used for transferring internet protocol, or IP, content across coaxial cables and phone lines whereas HPAV is used for transferring IP content across power lines. G.hn is the next generation International Telecommunications Union (“ITU”) standard ratified in 2011 to create a unified global standard across coaxial cables, phone lines, and power lines. Products based on these technologies enable service providers, such as telecommunication carriers, cable operators and satellite providers, to deliver high definition television services (“HDTV”) and other media-rich applications throughout the home. Our HomePNA chipsets comply with the ITU G.9954 standard to support distribution of multimedia content throughout the home, while our HomePlug AV chipsets provide connectivity over existing powerline wiring, supporting advanced encryption standard (“AES”), high quality of service (“QoS”) and remote management and diagnostic capabilities. Our G.hn chipset is compliant with ITU G.9960/61 which supports connectivity over any type of existing wires inside the home. We designed the G.hn chipset to employ multiple input, multiple output (“MIMO”) technology to deliver higher throughput with extended coverage even in the presence of high noise conditions. To date, we have not generated significant revenue from our products based on HPAV or G.hn technologies.

IoT Devices
 
Our IoT Devices family consists of our wireless Z-Wave chips, modules and cellular-based mobile IoT tracking tags and modems. Our Z-Wave chips and modules are incorporated into devices that enable consumers to enjoy advanced home control and automation functionality, such as home security, environmental and energy control and monitoring, within both new and existing homes. Devices that incorporate our wireless chips and modules operate on the Z-Wave mesh networking protocol. Our Z-Wave wireless chips utilize a low-bitrate, low-power, low-cost RF communication technology that provides an interoperable platform for home automation security and monitoring solutions. We derive most of our revenue within our IoT Devices product line by selling a module, which includes a Z-Wave chip plus additional circuitry and components that provide our customers with a ready-to-use solution. Our Z-Wave chips and the Z-Wave protocol they use to communicate commands have been built into an ecosystem of over 1,600 certified interoperable products, consisting primarily of intelligent appliances for use within the home.   
 
Our mobile IoT solutions are currently used primarily for tracking applications, such as small tags that can be attached to track pets, keys, children, luggage, and vehicles. These solutions are based on the Long-Term Evolution (“LTE”) network and leading edge systems technology (from our acquisition of Bretelon in fiscal 2016) to provide an ultra-low power and low-cost device. We believe this technology is very versatile and has the ability to be powered by inexpensive coin cell batteries or other power supply methods, such as from an external DC input and rechargeable batteries. We anticipate the formal introduction of this product line in the second half of fiscal 2018. Most of our mobile IoT revenue to date has been based on non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) contracts.
 
License Arrangements and Other Products
 
From time to time, we derive revenue from the license of our internally developed intellectual property. We also offer certain legacy products that are sold into prosumer and other industrial applications. We also derive revenue from the sale of products including software development kits, and engineering support services for hardware and software. These products account for a minor portion of our total revenue.
Target Markets
 
Connected Smart TV Platforms Market
 
The Connected Smart TV Platforms market (previously reported as three separate target markets of Smart TV, Media Connectivity and Set-top Box) consists of all products that are sold into digital televisions as well as other adjacent markets using chipset products that are designed for video post-processing, products delivering IP streaming video, including hybrid versions of these products and communication devices that use a standard protocol to connect equipment inside the home and stream IP-based video and audio, VoIP, or data through wired or wireless connectivity. We serve this market with our media processor chips, dedicated post-processing products and home networking controllers.
IoT Devices Market
 
The IoT Devices market consists of both smart home applications (including gateways and automated consumer devices) and mobile IoT applications (primarily tracking tags). Our smart home product line is marketed under our Z-Wave brand of wireless chips, modules and Z-Wave mesh networking protocol.
License and Other Markets
 
The license and other markets includes other products and services, including technology licenses, software development kits, and engineering support services for hardware and software.

Characteristics of Our Business
 
We do not enter into long-term commitment contracts with our customers, instead we rely on customer purchase orders to generate substantially all of our net revenue. However, our failure to accurately forecast demand can lead to product shortages that can impede production by our customers, may harm our relationship with these customers or lead to excess inventory, which could negatively impact our gross margins in a particular period. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded provisions for excess inventory of $2.0 million, $3.2 million and $4.3 million, respectively, primarily as a result of the end of life of certain products.
 
Our Connected Smart TV Platforms market is based on the annual cycle of product launches. Major new consumer products are designed during the spring, produced during the summer and launched in the fall to take advantage of the holiday selling season. We expect our Connected Smart TV Platforms market to experience seasonality typical of the consumer electronics market, wherein the holiday selling season commands the highest sell-through of consumer electronic end-products, making the third quarter typically the strongest selling season for semiconductor components such as our chips and chipsets.  We expect to experience lower sales in our first and fourth fiscal quarters and higher sales in our second and/or third fiscal quarters as a result of this seasonality of demand. Therefore, our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. 
 
For our Set-top Box products, we forecast demand based not only on our assessment of the requirements of our direct customers, but also on the anticipated requirements of the telecommunications carriers that our direct customers serve. We work with both our direct customers and these carriers to address the market demands and the necessary specifications for our technologies.   Our business is substantially dependent upon being designed into set-top boxes and we must spend a considerable amount of resources to compete for these design wins. If we do obtain these design wins, it is often the case that our end customer and direct customer will continue to incorporate our chipset solutions for that generation of set-top boxes.  However, if we are not designed into a particular generation of set-top boxes for our large target end customers, we stand to lose that portion of our market for the entire deployment time, which is typically two to three years. 
 
Our IoT Devices market is characterized by the popularity of competing standards within the United States, Asia, and the European markets recognized by the ITU and other governing bodies. Our mobile IoT solutions are currently used primarily for tracking applications, such as small tags that can be attached to track pets, keys, children, luggage, and vehicles. The value of our IoT Devices market lies in the recognition of Z-Wave as a North American market leader for home automation and energy management within the security industry. The primary differentiation between Z-Wave and other competing standards in the IoT Devices market is the requirement that all Z-Wave devices conform to a strict application level of device-to-device communication and operability, which allows all Z-Wave devices to be interoperable. This interoperability requirement does not exist with any other competing technologies in the IoT Devices market. We expect our IoT Devices market to grow in direct proportion to the adoption of the Z-Wave standard by a number of service integrators and service providers. 
 
Both of our target markets are also characterized by intense price competition. The semiconductor industry is highly competitive and, as a result, we expect our average selling prices to decline over time. On occasion, we have reduced our prices for individual customer volume orders as part of our strategy to obtain a competitive position in our markets. The willingness of customers to design our chipsets into their products depends to a significant extent upon our ability to sell our products at competitive prices.  If we are unable to reduce our costs sufficiently to offset any declines in product selling prices or are unable to introduce more advanced products with higher gross margins in a timely manner, we could see declines in our market share or gross margins.  We expect our gross margins will vary from period to period due to changes in our average selling prices and average costs, volume order discounts, mix of product sales, amount of development revenue and provisions for inventory excess and obsolescence.

Industry Background
 
The growth of the internet, proliferation of over-the-top content, advances in communications infrastructure, digital video and audio compression technologies, home networking technologies and improvements in television displays have resulted in significant consumer demand for the end products sold in the markets that we primarily target.
 
The demand for our Smart TV products is driven by the advent of digital video and Internet streaming services, which supplement traditional delivery mechanisms such as over the air broadcasts, cable, satellite, DVDs and Blu-ray. The transition of premium televisions to ultra-high definition, also known as Ultra-HD, is a primary example of this shift. Ultra-HD is comprised of two general signal standards known as “4K” and “8K”. A 4K signal is comprised of 3840 pixels by 2160 lines and has four times more pixels than the older Full-High Definition or Full-HD, which consists of only 1920 pixels by 1080 lines. While new television sets capable of displaying 4K content have entered the market, widespread availability of 4K content has not been achieved. Generally, consumer multimedia entertainment applications are increasingly requiring video and audio data to be processed, transmitted, stored and displayed in an efficient and secure manner while simultaneously maintaining high resolution, multi-channel audio/video functionality and providing the end-user a variety of interactive options.  In order to provide this increased functionality in a cost-effective manner, manufacturers of consumer electronics demand semiconductors that integrate more features on a single chip as well as reduce their costs, time-to-market and power consumption.  A challenge to manufacturers of digital media processors is to balance the integration of more functionality with lower costs and shorter development cycles. 
 
Our Internet Protocol television, or IPTV, portion of the Set-top Box products is primarily driven by video service providers, such as telecommunication service providers, who utilize video servers and set-top boxes to deliver television services based on streaming video over broadband connections using IP streaming. IPTV has become an important consumer multimedia application as it allows telecommunications carriers to deliver advanced video services to consumers using existing telecommunications infrastructure.  These carriers are actively pursuing the deployment of IPTV because it enables them to offer attractive video, voice and data, or triple play, services and increase their revenue per subscriber.  A challenge faced in delivering high-quality video content to end users across existing copper-based telecommunications infrastructure is the limited data carrying capacity of the existing wiring.  This challenge can be addressed by advanced video compression technologies along with advanced high-speed communication technologies, which together can overcome the capacity limitation to allow the delivery of high definition video service throughout the home.  IPTV set-top boxes currently use one of three platforms based on software developed previously by Microsoft and now provided by Ericsson or various Android or Linux providers, each of which offers certain advantages and disadvantages.
 
Our Media Connectivity products are involved in routing digital entertainment streams to ensure that television service and other shared media resources are accessible throughout the home.  Currently, home video networking uses both wired and wireless connections to distribute entertainment streams under one of the many networking standards that exist.  Although wireless networking products, operating through Wi-Fi networks is the most widely accepted industry standard for use in home video distribution, wired connectivity remains a competitive option in select segments of the market. 
 
Starting with the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we have combined certain target markets that we previously reported separately commensurate with changes taking effect in our industry as a whole. We combined our Smart TV, Media Connectivity and Set-top Box markets into one target market, which we refer to as the Connected Smart TV Platforms target market. This target market is intended to include all of our products sold into or supporting the digital television experience including products designed for video-post processing, delivering of IP streaming video, audio, VoIP, or data and the equipment intended to connect these various home entertainment products. We have historically and continue to operate under the belief that the Smart TV, Set-top Box and Media Connectivity products complement their respective value propositions to the markets into which we sell. This combination is intended to present this value proposition as a holistic solution or platform for the anticipated convergence of IP-video, audio and data delivery across any device within the connected home. All previously reported amounts in prior periods have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect our target market change.
 
Our IoT Devices market product categorizations remain unchanged, and beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 includes products and services we now sell as a result of our acquisition of Bretelon. IoT Devices products enable remote control and monitoring of a wide variety of home appliances, such as thermostats, lighting and door locks.  Much of the early adoption for home control and energy management products has been driven by installations of new security systems for the consumer home.  However, the recent deployment of IoT Devices products by an increasing number of larger system integrators and service providers has perpetuated the growing popularity of this market within the consumer goods industry. Low frequency, low power solutions can offer consumers cost efficient ways to monitor and conserve energy usage, protect homes from theft and damage and improve the convenience of performing certain household activities. Z-Wave’s device-interoperability allows service and security providers to deploy solutions with Z-Wave, secure in the knowledge that their solutions will operate with products from name brand vendors sold at retail and online. This allows service providers to focus on their core technology, with the services that they provide, and not the making or sourcing of the devices.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Highly Integrated Chipsets Leveraged Across Multiple Consumer Applications. We have developed a proprietary chipset architecture that allows us to integrate high-performance digital video and audio decoding, graphics processing, security management and home audio/video networking and advanced image processing. Our chipsets can replace a number of single function semiconductors, which can significantly improve performance, lower power consumption and reduce total system cost to our customers. Furthermore, all of these functions can be performed synchronously at high processing speeds. Our ability to integrate these multiple functions into a single, high-speed semiconductor allows us to address many different consumer multimedia entertainment applications with the same hardware platform. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Differentiated Software Development Capabilities. As a result of over 15 years of experience in delivering video and audio solutions, we have developed expertise in real-time software that synchronizes and controls the playback of video and audio from a variety of sources. This software translates the complex silicon architecture of our chipsets into a much simpler application programming interface. Using this interface, our customers are able to design their products under industry standard operating systems, enabling them to customize our solutions and reduce their time to market. The majority of our engineering personnel are dedicated to software development. 


• | Multi-Standard Functionality. We design our chipsets to support multiple industry standards that are used across most consumer entertainment applications. For example, there are over a dozen different video and audio standards used in current consumer applications, including video standards such as HEVC, H.264, MPEG-4, MPEG-2, MPEG-1 and WMV9, and audio standards such as Dolby, DTS and MP3. Beyond this, there are a range of digital rights management security standards such as AES, RSA and MSDRM. Additionally, there are three primary operating systems, Android, Linux and Microsoft Windows CE, each of which has its own middleware standards. The ability of our chipsets to support a multitude of standards allows us to deliver increased product functionality to our customers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Breadth and Depth of Relationships within the Set-top Box Industry and Service Providers. In order to provide a complete system-level solution for the IPTV industry, we have developed strong relationships with industry leaders that form the ecosystem required to deliver an end-to-end solution, from content creation to content display. The IPTV ecosystem consists of providers of middleware, encoders and security solutions. For middleware, server software must be successfully integrated into our products to provide effective system solutions for the service providers. For security solutions, there are also a range of providers, including Microsoft and Nagra. We were one of the first media processing semiconductor providers to work extensively with IPTV set-top box manufacturers, including Ericsson’s Mediaroom ecosystem, as well as telecommunications carriers to design solutions that address their specific feature and performance requirements. Additionally, we deliver some of the leading IPTV connectivity solutions for set-top boxes and residential gateways. Through these experiences, we have gained valuable insight into the challenges of our customers and carriers and have gained visibility into their product development plans. As a result, we believe we are able to provide our customers with a stable and reliable source of field-proven solutions. Our strong position in the IPTV industry has enabled us to develop and maintain relationships with these providers and offer solutions that are interoperable with their products. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Z-Wave Standardization, Interoperability and Ecosystem. Our Z-Wave technology provides system integrators access to over 1,000 products complying with the Z-Wave standard and with guaranteed interoperability which we believe creates an attractive ecosystem. This makes our Z-Wave technology unique in the IoT Devices market, and a prime candidate to be selected by new service providers entering this emerging space. Because the International Telecommunication Union, or ITU, has developed a new sub 1GHz narrow band wireless standard which is largely based on Z-Wave technology and defines backwards compatibility to the Z-Wave standard, and because of the large ecosystem of products based on the Z-Wave standard, we believe our Z-Wave products will be one of the preferred solutions for telecommunication and multi-service operators in the future.

Our Strategy
 
Our objective is to be the leading provider of SoC solutions used to deliver entertainment, automation and control throughout the home.  To achieve this objective, we expect to continue to pursue the following strategies:

• | Increase Penetration in Connected Smart TV Platforms market. Through our acquisition of Trident’s DTV business, we have obtained a position in the digital television market, specifically targeting the new generation of Connected Smart TV Platforms that will feature 4K Ultra-HD video. We are currently fostering a number of key industry partnerships and collaborative relationships that have allowed us to increase our market presence. These industry partnerships and collaborative relationships have positioned us to further develop our technology into a leading solution in the Ultra-HD video and IP streaming set-top boxes market. Currently, our chipsets incorporate both hardware and software elements that enable Connected Smart TV Platforms features and content access, while also managing all of the routine television functions. We have developed unified broadband home networking technology under the G.hn standard, and we believe G.hn provides a way of unifying the demand under a single standard encompassing all wired transmission media (coaxial cable, phone line and power line) in the home. We believe our product line is differentiated by the hardware technologies such as frame-rate-conversion as well as sophisticated software such as internet connectivity and web portal access. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhance our Software Advantage. We believe our software provides a suite of capabilities that offer differentiated advantages from our competitors. Our software is, at times, integrated and embedded into our customers’ products during their product design stage. As a result, once we are designed into our customers’ product, we believe it is difficult for our competitors to displace us. We intend to leverage our software development capabilities and continue to invest significant resources in developing additional expertise in the area of high-performance software development, over-the-top video delivery software, and customer support. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our position in home monitoring, automation and control. We have developed a strong position in the home monitoring, automation and control market and intend to expand this position with our Z-Wave technology to encompass security, energy management, and other services. This expansion will be largely achieved through the addition of service offerings from existing service providers, such as AT&T, ADT, Vivint, and others. As the market develops, we believe these providers expect to leverage additional value-added features from remote access capabilities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage Existing Relationships. We have developed relationships within standards and platform-defining entities, which enable us to win new customers effectively. We also have strong customer relationships with many set-top box and connected media player designers and consumer device manufacturers. Further, we continue to work closely with telecommunications carriers to understand their needs in advance of our customer’s product development cycle. These existing relationships allow us to leverage our position to identify and secure new market opportunities.

Customers and Strategic Relationships
 
We sell our products principally to designers and manufacturers (OEMs and ODMs) as well as to distributors who, in turn, sell to manufacturers. Typically, when we sell to a distributor, that distributor has already received an order for our products directly from a manufacturer. Sales to our customers are typically made on a purchase order basis. We have also established strategic relationships with telecommunications carriers that provide wired and wireless communications services to consumers and businesses. More recently, we have established strategic partnerships with large producers of consumer electronics that increase our presence and exposure in the television market. 
 
Our success within the Connected Smart TV Platforms market depends on our ability to achieve design wins and successfully integrate our chipsets into certain consumer electronics products. Specifically, our business depends on the demand for our chipsets from large producers of consumer electronics within the television market, who are often not direct customers but deploy products that incorporate our chipsets. Demand for our chipsets is determined by the number of design wins we are able to achieve within these producers’ suites of product offerings. Even though we often do not sell our products directly to these large producers, they have a significant impact on the demand for our chipsets. 
 
Our business also depends on demand for our chipsets from companies, such as large telecommunication carriers, who are not our direct customers but deploy IPTV set-top boxes that incorporate our chipsets. Large carriers often use multiple set-top box providers, who in turn may use multiple contract manufacturers to purchase our chipsets and manufacture set-top boxes. Even though we do not sell our products directly to the companies that ultimately deploy set-top boxes directly to consumers, they have a significant impact on the demand for our chipsets.
 
A substantial portion of our product shipments are to customers outside of North America. In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, net revenue from our customers outside of North America accounted for 85%, 81%, and 89% of our net revenue, respectively. Revenue from our customers in Asia accounted for 82%, 76% and 81% of our net revenue in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales and marketing strategy is to achieve design wins with technology leaders by providing quality, state-of-the-art products through superior sales channels. We sell our products worldwide through multiple channels, including our direct sales force, manufacturer representatives and independent distributors strategically located in a number of countries around the world. Members of our direct sales force are based in the United States, Denmark, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. Our sales are also supported by representatives, resellers and distributors in other key countries such as Brazil, China, and India.
 
Our sales cycle typically ranges from nine to eighteen months, and depends on a number of factors including the technical capabilities of the customer, the customer’s need for customization of our chipsets and the length of the customer’s evaluation and qualification process. In many cases, we must also qualify our products with our technology partners and, in some cases, with an end customer (e.g., a service provider). This qualification process may extend our sales cycle beyond its typical duration. We generally plan the fabrication of our products based on customer forecasts. In some instances, customer forecasts are driven by seasonality, where our customers plan product launches around the holiday season.
 
For our larger volume designer and manufacturer customers, purchase orders for our products are generally non-cancelable between four and twelve weeks before our scheduled delivery dates and not subject to rescheduling within four weeks of scheduled delivery dates.

Competition
 
The semiconductor industry generally, and the consumer electronics market specifically, are highly competitive markets and are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving standards, decreasing average selling prices per unit, and short product life cycles. We believe that the principal factors on which we compete include time-to-market for new product introductions, product performance, customer interface and support, industry standards compatibility, software functionality, image quality, price, and product support.
 
We compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of chipset solutions and related applications, including the following, among others: Broadcom Ltd., Mediatek, RealTek, ST Microelectronics, Marvell Technology Group, Ltd. and Qualcomm in our Connected Smart TV Platforms market segment; and Texas Instruments, Freescale and Silicon Laboratories (through their selection and use of Zigbee-based chips for their product offerings), in our IoT Devices market segment. 
 
Many of the aforementioned companies have higher profiles, larger financial resources and greater marketing resources than we do and may develop a competitive product that may inhibit the wide acceptance of our products. Additionally, we believe that other manufacturers may be developing products that will compete directly with our products in the near future. As a result, we are continuously in the process of developing new products with the intent to improve customer appeal, address new technologies, and provide competitive advantages, where possible.
 
Research and Development
 
We focus our research and development efforts primarily on two areas: video/audio decoder technologies and secure media processing for the Connected Smart TV Platforms market and IoT Devices market. In building new solutions, our strategy is to build fully integrated chips and chipsets. To achieve and maintain our leadership position in the technology industry, we intend to continue to make advancements in the areas of video and audio compression and decompression as well as wired and wireless connectivity. We expect these advancements will include maintaining compatibility with emerging standards on multiple platforms, and making improvements to our current chip architecture to improve memory size and increase energy efficiency.
 
We have invested, and expect that we will continue to invest, substantial resources in research and development of performance enhancements, cost reductions and additional features for future generations of our solutions to remain competitive in our industry. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 our research and development expenses were $74.0 million, $68.8 million and $67.5 million, respectively. 
 
We have assembled a qualified team of experienced engineers and technology experts. As of January 28, 2017, we had 517 research and development employees. Along with the assistance of a number of independent contractors and consultants, these employees guide all of our internal product development.
 
 
11



Intellectual Property
 
Our success and future revenue growth depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well as agreements with customers, suppliers and employees to protect our proprietary technologies and processes.
 
As of January 28, 2017, we held 134 issued patents and we had 33 patent applications pending for our technology. The expiration dates of these patents are within the next one to twenty years. We cannot assure that more patents will be issued or that such patents, even if issued, or our existing patents, will provide adequate protection for our competitive position. Additionally, because we have participated and continue to participate in developing various industry standards, we may be required to license some of our patents to others, including competitors, who develop products based on those standards.

We generally enter into confidentiality agreements, evaluation (limited) license agreements, and technology license agreements with our employees and strategic partners, and typically control access to and distribution of product documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies and processes, develop similar technology independently, or design around our patents. As such, any rights granted under our patents may not provide us with meaningful protection.

Manufacturing
 
We are a fabless semiconductor company and we do not own or operate a fabrication, packaging or testing facility. We depend on third-party vendors to manufacture, package and test our products. By outsourcing manufacturing, we are able to avoid the costs associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing facility. This allows us to focus our efforts on the design and marketing of our products.
 
Semiconductor fabrication
 
We rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (“TSMC”), Global Foundries (“GF”) and, to a lesser extent, Grace Semiconductors, to fulfill the majority of our semiconductor fabrication needs, including chipset manufacturing. We believe that our fabless manufacturing approach provides us with the benefits of superior manufacturing capability as well as flexibility to move the manufacturing, assembly and testing of our products to those vendors that offer the best capability at an attractive price. Nevertheless, we do not have long-term pricing agreements with all of our third-party manufacturers, therefore, our costs and services are subject to sudden price fluctuations based on the cyclical demand for semiconductors.  In addition, we may be unable to secure sufficient capacity at our third-party manufacturers’ facilities, which could harm our ability to ship products to our customers in a timely manner and negatively impact our financial results in a particular period. 
 
Assembly and test
 
Once our wafers have been manufactured, they are shipped from TSMC, GF, and our other third-party foundries to independent assembly and test facilities where they are sorted, packaged and tested.  Generally, we store our sorted die in our die bank and only package the products for sale when we book an order.  We outsource all packaging and testing of our products to independent third-party assembly and test facilities, primarily to Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. (“ASE”) in Taiwan.  Our products are designed to use low-cost, standard packages and to be tested with widely available test equipment.
 
Quality assurance
 
We are committed to maintaining the highest level of quality in our products.  We have designed and implemented a quality management system that provides the framework for continual improvement of products, processes and customer service to ensure customer satisfaction.  We also rely on in-depth simulation studies, design review and verification during our design phase, bench testing to perform design validation, product reliability qualification to verify the product’s quality and manufacturing testing when the products are in production.  To ensure consistent product quality, reliability and yield, together with our manufacturing logistics partners, we closely monitor the production cycle by regularly reviewing manufacturing process data from each wafer foundry and assembly subcontractor.  We are ISO 9001 certified as are our key manufacturing partners, ASE, TSMC and GF.

Environmental Laws
 
Our products and certain aspects of our operations are regulated under various environmental laws in the U.S., Europe and other parts of the world. These environmental laws are broad in scope and regulate numerous activities including the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the content of our products and the recycling and treatment and disposal of our products. Certain of these laws also pertain to tracking and labeling potentially harmful substances that may have been incorporated into our products. These product labeling and environmental laws require us to know whether certain substances are present in our products, and to what degree. Environmental laws may limit the use of certain substances in our products, or may require us to provide product safety information to our customers if certain substances are present in our products in sufficient quantities. Additionally, we may be required to recycle certain of our products when they become waste. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations across multiple jurisdictions is complex and we regularly review known and pending laws and regulations to ensure we are compliant. We did not incur any material expenditures in fiscal 2017 in relation to any environmental matters.
Backlog
 
Our backlog, which primarily comprises cancellable purchase orders from our customers, at January 28, 2017, was approximately $27.1 million, compared with backlog of approximately $23.7 million at January 30, 2016. As our sales are made primarily through purchase orders from the delivery of products, the amount of backlog at any date depends upon various factors, including the timing of the receipt of orders, fluctuations in orders for existing product lines and the introduction of any new product lines.  Accordingly, we believe that the amount of our backlog at any date is not a reliable measure of our future revenue.
Employees
 
As of January 28, 2017, we had 718 full-time employees worldwide, including 517 in research and development, 99 in sales and marketing, 78 in general and administration and 24 in operations and quality assurance.
 
Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical, marketing, engineering and management personnel who are in great demand.  While we have works councils or employee representatives in certain countries, our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit and we have never experienced a work stoppage.  We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
