Services and Products
 
Mailing and Shipping Business
 
We offer the following mailing and shipping products and services to our customers under the Stamps.com, Endicia, ShipStation, ShipWorks and ShippingEasy brands:
 
USPS Mailing and Shipping Solutions
 
Under the Stamps.com and Endicia brands, customers use our USPS-approved mailing and shipping solutions to mail and ship a variety of mail pieces and packages through the USPS.  Customers can purchase and print postage 24 hours a day, seven days a week, through our software or web interfaces. Typically, customers fund an account balance prior to using our service. The customers then draw down their prepaid account balance as they print postage and repurchase postage as necessary.
 
Our USPS mailing and shipping solutions enable users to print “electronic postage” directly onto envelopes, plain paper, or labels using only a standard personal computer, printer and Internet connection. Our solutions support a variety of USPS mail classes including First Class Mail®, Priority Mail®, Priority Mail Express®, Media Mail®, Parcel Select®, and others. Customers can also add to their mail pieces USPS Special Services such as USPS TrackingTM, Signature ConfirmationTM, Registered Mail, Certified Mail, Insured Mail, Return Receipt, Collect on Delivery and Restricted Delivery. Our customers can print postage (1) on NetStamps® or DYMO Stamps® labels, which can be used just like regular stamps, (2) directly on envelopes and postcards or on labels in a single step process that saves time and provides a professional look, (3) on plain 8.5” x 11” paper or on special labels for packages, and (4) on integrated customs forms for international mail and packages.
 
Our mailing and shipping solutions incorporate address verification technology that verifies each destination address for mail or packages sent using our solutions against a database of all known addresses in the United States. Our mailing and shipping solutions are also integrated with common small business and productivity software applications such as word processing, contact and address management, and accounting and financial applications. Our shipping solutions feature integrations with hundreds of partners and carriers including popular shipping management products, shopping carts, online marketplaces and other e-commerce solutions.
 
We target different customer categories with service plans that provide various features and capabilities. We target smaller offices, home offices, and smaller online sellers that need a more basic set of mailing and shipping features. We target larger enterprises that need a richer set of mailing capabilities such as multiple-user functionality, automated Certified Mail forms, additional reference codes and higher allowable postage balances. We target shippers such as e-commerce merchants, online retailers, fulfillment houses, warehouses, and large retailers that need shipping specific features such as direct integration into the customer’s order databases, faster label printing speed and the ability to customize and save shipping profiles. We target large corporations with multiple geographic locations that need enhanced reporting and the ability for a central location, such as a corporate headquarters, to have greater visibility and control over postage expenditures across their distributed network of locations.  We target large volume mailers that need features designed for presort mail, Certified Mail, and bulk address updating.
 
Customers typically pay us a monthly subscription fee which varies depending on their service plan.  In certain circumstances, customers may be on a plan where they do not owe us any monthly service fees. Under certain plans or arrangements, customers or integration partners pay a fee per transaction for shipping labels printed.  We have arrangements with the USPS under which if a customer or integration partner prints a certain amount of domestic or international First Class, Priority Mail or Priority Mail Express shipping labels, the USPS compensates us directly and the customer can qualify to have their service fees waived or refunded.  In addition, we also have service plans with lower monthly subscription fees which offer more limited functionality and are targeted at retaining customers who print a lower volume of postage.  We offer service plans where customers are not charged a monthly fee but instead purchase labels for use as needed. We also offer high volume mailing products for a one time upfront fee.  We also earn compensation by offering customers a discounted postage rate that is provided to the customers by our integration partners, and we may earn other types of revenue share or other compensation from specific customers or partners.

We have an integration partnership with Amazon.com that makes our domestic and international shipping labels for certain USPS package classes available to Amazon.com Marketplace users. The integration allows Marketplace users to automatically pay for postage using their Marketplace Payments account, set a default ship-from address so they do not have to type or write it for each shipment, and automatically populate the ship-to address on the label. Domestic and international mail classes are supported and Marketplace users may request carrier pickup from the USPS.

(2) | Our USPS solutions allow customers to generate mass mailings quickly and easily by printing the address and postage together in a single step process.

----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Our solutions integrate with most small business productivity applications such as word processors, financial applications and address books so our customers can save time by utilizing these integrations to print postage through their existing applications; and

 2017 Business Strategy
 
Mailing and Shipping Business


Our 2017 Mailing and Shipping business strategy includes the initiatives and plans listed below. These initiatives and plans are subject to change without notice based on our analysis of market and business conditions, and constitute “forward-looking statements,” and accordingly are subject to the cautionary statements, qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements we discuss at the beginning of Part I of this Report.
 
(1) Leverage our portfolio of mailing and shipping solutions to drive growth.
 
With the acquisitions of Endicia, ShipStation, ShipWorks and ShippingEasy, we now have a full and diverse suite of solutions across these brands, and we believe that we have a very complete product solution that will meet the needs of our current and of our target customers. Our customers’ needs vary based on their specific situations including: (1) specific technology or operating system support such as Windows versus Mac and web-based versus client-based solutions; (2) breadth and depth of product features; (3) product ease-of-use which is often traded off versus product capability and complexity; (4) ease and speed for processing large volumes of packages in the fewest number of steps; (5) breadth and depth of integrations with partner solutions such as e-Commerce tools, shopping carts, and online marketplaces; and (6) number of private carrier supported (e.g., UPS, FedEx, DHL, regional carriers, international carriers, etc.). For example, a particular e-commerce shipper may need a web-based solution running on a Mac that has deep product features for processing large batches of packages in just a few steps, and that customer may require an integration with eBay, Amazon and Shopify for importing customer orders, and may also require support to ship packages via USPS, FedEx, DHL, Canada Post and Australia Post.  In this case, the customer needs would be met using our ShipStation solution. Our goal is to be able to meet the needs of as many customers as possible so that we can maximize our customer acquisition, maximize our average annual revenue per paid customer, reduce our churn, and increase overall customer usage.
 
(2) Capitalize on synergy opportunities with our acquired companies.
 
During 2016 we continued to see the benefits from our 2014 acquisitions of ShipStation and ShipWorks, and we successfully integrated and realized our expected synergies from our 2015 acquisition of Endicia.  During 2016 we completed our acquisition of ShippingEasy and began the integration of that business as well.  Across all of our products and services, we are realizing synergies in sales and marketing, operations, customer service, and product development, and we believe that we have built a strong platform for pursuing all of our target markets.  In the marketing area Stamps.com and the acquired companies have historically targeted many of the same customers and we plan to continue utilizing our marketing expertise to accelerate growth, particularly with our newer multi-carrier solutions.  In addition, we invest financial resources to enhance the scope and magnitude of our marketing efforts of the various acquired brands, and we bring a national sales force that sells all of the various solutions, offering a more complete set of options when selling solutions to customers.  We also believe that the technology expertise in our companies is synergistic as ShipStation and ShippingEasy’s web-based expertise complements the client-based expertise of Stamps.com, Endicia and ShipWorks, and together our combined teams are able to leverage and educate each other in new and unfamiliar technologies, and this may result in more rapid and lower cost product innovation.
 
(3) Invest for growth in the shipping part of our business.
 
Our shipping customers include e-commerce merchants, warehouses, fulfillment houses, large retailers and other types of shippers. E-commerce shipping is the fastest growing part of the mailing and shipping industry. According to the U.S. Commerce Department, e-commerce sales grew is growing at approximately 16% year over year, and a large percentage of our company investments are being made to target e-commerce shippers.  For 2017 and beyond we expect to continue making these large investments in order to attract these types of shippers to our solutions.  Shipping customers are more expensive to acquire than small business customers but yield higher longer-term return on investment with their typical characteristics including higher average revenue per paid customer, lower monthly customer cancellation rates and higher postage usage when compared to other small businesses that predominately use our services to send mail.
 
 8
 

(4) Expand the features and functionality of our solutions, particularly in the shipping part of our business.

We plan to continue to enhance our technology and solutions for our target customers that include e-commerce merchants, warehouses, fulfillment houses, large retailers and other types of shippers. We will enhance and add new features and functionality that will improve the value proposition of our solutions for shippers.  We plan to add new integrations for easier data export and import from the tools that customers use and add new carrier and partner integrations. We also plan to continue to build our support for new products such as inventory management, customer management and mobile solutions.
 
(5) Increase our sales and marketing investment.
 
Based on recent analysis and trends, we expect to get a strong return on our investment from our mailing and shipping customers because they have a high expected lifetime value relative to the expected cost of acquiring those customers. Accordingly, we plan to increase our total sales and marketing expense in 2017 versus 2016.  We plan to continue increasing our investment in direct sales, direct mail, traditional media, radio, television, search engine marketing, search engine optimization as well as refining our customer acquisition process through affiliates, partners, telemarketing and other areas.
 
(6) Enhance our enterprise solutions sales and marketing efforts.
 
Our solutions targeted at enterprise customers continue to have a stronger customer value proposition compared to postage meters and our customers continue to be attracted to our enterprise solution versus a postage meter. We believe this customer preference is based on our lower total cost of ownership and the greater visibility into individual employee activity available from our centralized front-end reporting tool that has capabilities that are not available with a postage meter such as real time data, improved web-based postage management tools, and enhanced web-based financial and administrative controls for central decision makers.  For 2017 we plan to increase, optimize and refine our enterprise customer lead generation and sales and marketing efforts.
 
Customized Postage
 
In 2017 we plan to continue marketing customized postage, but with limited spending and expectations. In recent years, we reduced our consumer-focused marketing spending in order to lower our customer acquisition costs and improve our expected returns and profitability in the customized postage business. We plan to continue our programs of focused direct-to-website marketing spending with a goal of keeping the overall cost per acquisition at a level that provides an attractive financial return.  We also plan to continue our efforts to generate high volume business orders which have become a larger part of our customized postage business in recent years.
Competition
 
As a result of our acquisitions of ShippingEasy, Endicia, ShipStation and ShipWorks, the number of companies with which we compete has expanded.  We compete with all of the alternate ways that consumers and businesses may access the services of the USPS, including retail mailing and shipping locations, USPS online products, USPS software solutions, traditional postage meters, and other USPS-approved PC Postage products. We also compete with other multi-carrier products, e-commerce products with shipping capabilities, shipping technology products available from private carriers, package manifesting systems, and large enterprise software solutions with shipping functionality such as transportation management, warehouse management, or enterprise resource planning systems.
Retail Mailing and Shipping Locations
 
The majority of our small business customers use our USPS solutions as an alternative to visiting USPS or other retail locations. The USPS owns and operates approximately 32,000 retail post offices across the United States. Many of the USPS retail post offices also feature a USPS kiosk for self-serve mailing and shipping services with more convenient access and over extended access hours. The USPS authorizes thousands of additional contract post offices, community post offices and village post offices which allow third parties to operate post offices that are not owned by the USPS, such as those available in Hallmark stores. We also compete for mailing and shipping customers with alternatives such as postage stamps and prepaid USPS shipping labels available at grocery stores and at discount chains such as Costco. We also compete with USPS mailing and shipping services available at small business mailing and shipping centers such as UPS Stores or FedEx Offices stores, and those available inside office supply stores such as Staples and Office Depot. Further, we have not been approved to offer our customers “Forever” postage rates which are rates that do not ever expire and do not require extra postage following a postage rate increase.
 
 9
 

We believe customers choose our products over retail mailing and shipping services because of the convenience of our solution, the breadth of features that we offer, the quality of our support organization and ability to mail or ship from their home or business without making a trip to retail locations. We believe customers choose retail locations over our solutions because of the additional fees that we typically charge, the convenience of utilizing a retail location, and/or the preference for a Forever postage label.
 
USPS Online Products
 
We compete with online services available at USPS.com. Users of USPS.com are able to print shipping labels using similar tools that we offer. But the services and features available at USPS.com are provided without service fees, creating a disadvantage for us because we typically charge service fees in our business model. The services at USPS.com also integrate well with other USPS online services such as package tracking, post office locators, and other USPS services. Additionally, USPS.com accepts PayPal for payment of postage but we are not approved to do so. USPS.com also features a mobile application for more convenient customer access to USPS services.
 
USPS services are also integrated directly into web shipping solutions available through eBay, PayPal and Amazon.com. Sellers operating within these marketplaces may purchase USPS shipping labels in a convenient manner as part of the standard checkout flow. In all of these online marketplaces, customers can print postage for shipping without paying a monthly service fee like we typically charge. These solutions also feature USPS package rate discounts that are similar to ours, and in some cases superior to the discounts we are approved to offer customers.  eBay in particular has offered its sellers USPS-approved postage rates that are lower than the rates other online USPS providers are approved to offer.  For postage payment these web shipping solutions use the USPS’s electronic verification system (eVS), the USPS’s solution branded ePostage or another approved USPS PC postage vendor.
 
We believe customers choose our solutions over USPS online products because of the capabilities and performance of our products, the breadth of features that we offer, and the quality of our support organization. We believe customers choose USPS online products to meet their shipping needs over our solutions because of the additional fees that we may charge, the convenience of using one of these online products, and/or the package rates which may be superior to the package rates we are able to offer.
 
USPS Software Solutions
 
We compete with USPS private-labeled downloadable software and API (application program interface) solutions which are offered under the brand names Click-N-Ship for Business, Click-N-Ship Business Pro and USPS Web Tools. These solutions are targeted at higher volume business users or partners and include enhanced features for higher volume customers compared to those available at USPS.com. For postage payment these solutions utilize the USPS’s electronic verification system (eVS), or utilize the USPS’s solution branded ePostage, which are two similar systems for providing access to USPS shipping without needing PC Postage. eVS and ePostage offer more convenient solutions to higher-volume shippers with certain advantages we cannot offer such as: (1) labels can be printed “offline” without requiring an internet connection; (2) labels are not charged to a customer’s account until they are inserted into the mail stream; (3) eVS/ePostage labels do not expire and can be used at any time; (4) eVS/ePostage labels do not need to be saved and submitted for refunds; and (5) eVS/ePostage labels are able to support newer USPS features such as package intercept and re-routing, or certain USPS returns products.  Additionally, all USPS software solutions are made available to customers with no additional monthly or transaction fees, and they may also be offered with discounts on the postage rates that are superior to the discounts that we are able to provide to our customers.

We believe customers choose our solutions over USPS software solutions because of the capabilities and performance of our products, the breadth of features that we offer, and the quality of our sales and support organization. We believe customers choose USPS software solutions over our solutions because of the additional fees that we may charge, the convenience of using one of these software products, and/or the package rates which are offered to the customer and which may be superior to the package rates we offer.
 
Traditional Postage Meters
 
We compete with traditional postage meters offered by Pitney Bowes, Neopost, FP Mailing Solutions and Hasler in the U.S. market. Postage meters offer customers a simple user interface and often work better in a higher volume mail preparation process since postage meters can add postage after an envelope has already been stuffed and sealed, and can automatically weigh an envelope and add the appropriate postage.  Additionally, more expensive postage meters can add postage to envelopes at rates that are faster than postage can be added using our USPS solutions since we are limited by the speed of an office printer.
 
We believe that customers choose our mailing and shipping services over traditional postage meters because of our lower total cost of ownership and/or the greater visibility and financial controls we provide and which are not readily available with postage meters.  We believe customers choose postage meters over our solutions because of the ease of use, speed, and/or convenience of those products.
 
Other USPS-Approved PC Postage Vendors
 
We compete with other USPS-approved postage vendors. Currently, Pitney Bowes is the only other such vendor in addition to Stamps.com and Endicia.  However, EasyPost is currently in the USPS approval process to become an approved USPS PC Postage vendor and we compete with Shippo, an approved USPS ePostage provider.
 
Pitney Bowes is the current leader in the U.S. traditional postage meter business and offers software and web-based PC Postage services and integrations similar to our mailing and shipping services and integrations under the brand names pbSmartPostageTM and SendProTM. Pitney Bowes also offers shipping application programming interfaces (APIs) that customers and partners can integrate with Pitney Bowes solutions to obtain shipping labels. Pitney Bowes shipping APIs facilitate the web shipping solutions available through eBay and PayPal where sellers operating within those marketplaces may purchase USPS shipping labels in a convenient manner. Pitney Bowes also offers a customized postage offering similar to our PhotoStamps and PictureItPostage offerings under the brand name Custom Postage from Pitney Bowes through a partnership with Zazzle.com, a private U.S. company that specializes in manufacturing and marketing of custom products.
 
We believe that our customers choose our mailing and shipping solutions over those of the other PC Postage vendor because of our superior user interface, our larger breadth of features, our extensive partner integrations and our quality of customer service and support. For example, (1) we are the only mailing and shipping service that is tightly integrated into the native capabilities of Microsoft Office for use with Office’s mailing capabilities such as mail merge and envelope printing; (2) we are the only PC Postage provider with an integration partnership with Amazon.com for international shipping for their Marketplace users; (3) we support more address books than any other PC Postage software; and (4) we are the only company that offers customers the additional choice of our Themed and Photo NetStamps labels. Based on USPS data and our estimates, we believe we have the highest number of PC Postage customers of any PC Postage provider.

Private Carrier Technology Solutions
 
We compete with private carriers who offer their own shipping technology solutions such as UPS WorldShip, UPS.com, FedEx Ship Manager and Fedex.com. These private carrier solutions are provided at no cost to the customer and in many cases also include free implementation, free hardware such as printers or scales, and free consumables and other supplies. When customers evaluate carriers’ technology solutions, among other factors, they consider the cost and complexity of the technology product needed to access a particular carrier’s services.
 
We believe customers choose our solutions over private carrier technology solutions in order to utilize the package services of the USPS, to access multiple carriers from a single interface and because of the capabilities and performance of our products, the breadth of features that we offer, and the quality of our sales and support organization. We believe customers choose private carrier technology solutions over our solutions when they decide to utilize one of the private carriers instead of the USPS, as well as because of the additional free implementation, hardware or supplies the carrier offers, the quality of the carrier’s sales and support organization, and/or the technical capabilities of the private carrier’s solution. In some cases a customer may use both our USPS solution and a private carrier technology solution to meet their different needs.
 
Multi-Carrier E-commerce Solutions
 
ShippingEasy, ShipStation and ShipWorks provide multi-carrier solutions targeted at shippers such as warehouses, fulfillment houses, e-commerce shippers, large retailers, and other types of high volume shippers enabling the use of more than just the USPS for their business. In this area of our business, we compete with alternative means available to those categories of customer, including: other similar multi-carrier solutions (some of which are offered for free for lower volume users); warehouse and transportation management systems that offer multi-carrier shipping capabilities; package manifesting systems; e-commerce shopping carts that offer multi-carrier shipping solutions; and inventory management solutions or listing management solutions that offer multi-carrier solutions.
 
We believe customers choose our multi-carrier e-commerce products over alternative solutions because of the capabilities and performance of our products, the breadth of features that we offer, the value of our product, and the quality of our sales and support organization. We believe customers choose other multi-carrier e-commerce solutions over our solutions because of the higher fees that we may charge, the convenience of utilizing an integrated multi- carrier shipping solution as part of an overall e-commerce product, and the breadth and depth of features available in a larger enterprise solution that also includes multi-carrier shipping.
 
Industry Overview
 
Small and Home Businesses
 
According to statistics provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, there were approximately 6 million small businesses with 1 – 99 employees and approximately 24 million sole proprietorships.  In addition we believe there are approximately 24 million non-income generating home offices such as those used for corporate after-hours work or telecommuting, that we can service with our current solutions.  Our mailing and shipping solutions target the home office, home business, small office and small business customers.  We believe that some portion of the approximately 30 million small businesses and sole proprietorships and approximately 24 million home offices are potential customers for our solutions.
U.S. Mailing & Shipping
 
According to the USPS Fiscal 2016 Annual Report, the total USPS revenue was $71.4 billion during its fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Of this amount approximately $48.4 billion was represented by mail classes that are supported using our current solution (First Class Mail, First Class Packages, Priority Mail, Priority Mail Express, Media Mail, Parcel Select, International Mail, and special services including Certified Mail, Return Receipt, USPS tracking and package insurance).  The $48.4 billion in supported mail classes is comprised of (1) $27.3 billion in First Class mail; (2) $17.3 billion in shipping and package services; (3) $2.7 billion in international mail; and (4) $1.1 billion in special services. We believe that some portion of the $48.4 billion in supported mail classes was generated by users who are potential customers for our solutions.

Our multi-carrier shipping solutions ShippingEasy, ShipStation and ShipWorks also address the potential market represented by the private carriers.  According to data derived from the UPS 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, UPS earned $36.7 billion of U.S. Domestic Package revenue on 4 billion packages shipped.  According to data derived from the FedEx 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, FedEx earned approximately $36.4 billion on approximately 3 billion packages shipped via FedEx Ground and FedEx Express Packages.  When taken together, we estimate that the top 3 carriers (UPS, FedEx and the USPS) have U.S. domestic package revenue of approximately $90 billion.  According to data derived from Deutsche Post DHL Group’s 2015 Annual Report, we estimate there is approximately $1.8 billion represented by DHL Express International shipments originating in the U.S. We believe some portion of the approximately $92 billion package revenue was generated by users who are potential customers for our solutions.
 
E-commerce
 
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, total e-commerce sales for 2016 were estimated at $395 billion, an increase of 15.1% over 2015.  E-commerce sales accounted for 8.1% of total retail sales in 2016 which was up from 7.3% of total retail sales in 2015.  We believe the growth in e-commerce sales drives growth in the number of e-commerce packages shipped and that e-commerce merchants are potential customers of our solutions.
The PC Postage Certification and Regulatory Approval Process
 
Our technology must meet strict U.S. government security standards.  Our PC Postage products complete extensive USPS testing and evaluation in the areas of operational reliability, financial integrity and security to become certified for commercial distribution.  The USPS certification process to become an USPS-approved PC Postage vendor is a standardized extensive process. The process includes testing and reviews by the USPS and an independent test laboratory, and certification of meeting Federal Information Processing Standards. While the USPS has no published timeline or estimated time to complete the process, it took the existing approved vendors years to complete.  Stamps.com was approved in 1999 and Endicia was approved in 2000.
Our Technology
 
Our servers are located in high-security data centers and operate with proprietary security software. These servers create the data used to generate information-based indicia. They also process postage purchases using secure technology that meets USPS security requirements. Our services currently include Windows-based and Mac-based client applications and web-based applications that support a variety of label and envelope options and a wide range of printers.  In addition, our applications employ an internally developed user authentication mechanism for additional security.
 
Our transaction processing servers are a combination of secure, commercially available and internally developed technologies that are designed to provide secure and reliable transactions. Our implementation of security system hardware meets government standards for security and data integrity. The performance and scalability of our PC Postage system is designed to allow many users to simultaneously process postage transactions through our system. Our database servers are designed and built with industry-leading database technologies.
 
We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our rights in our products, services, know-how and information. We have a portfolio of issued and pending US and international patents.  We also have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks. We plan to apply for more patents and trademarks in the future. Our issued in force and pending patents have a range of expiration dates from 2017 until 2036. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-- Research and Development” for the amount spent during each of the last three fiscal years on Company-sponsored research and development activities.

Employees
 
As of December  31, 2016, we had approximately 700 employees, not including temporary or contract workers, across all of our companies including Stamps.com, Endicia, ShippingEasy, ShipStation and ShipWorks. Our employees work in various departments including customer support, research and development, sales and marketing, information technology and general administration. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.
Segments, Geographical and Revenue Information
 
We operate in a single reportable segment, “Internet Mailing and Shipping Solutions.”
 
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The Company's Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the CODM as defined by guidance regarding segment disclosures.
 
In 2015, we completed the reassessment of our segment reporting in light of our Endicia acquisition. Based on this reassessment, we identified two operating segments in accordance with ASC 280-10-50-1 through 50-9, Segment Reporting, consisting of Endicia and the remaining consolidated company.  Although the primary business activities for both operating segments consisted of providing Internet-based mailing and shipping solutions, each operating segment had discrete financial information available and our Chief Executive Officer, in his capacity as the CODM, reviewed the financial and operating metrics for the Endicia operating segment separately from those of the rest of the Company to inform resource allocation decisions and to assess performance. The primary purpose of the CODM reviewing Endicia’s financial information was to inform resource allocation decisions relating to achieving potential acquisition related synergies including the following areas: (1) cost reductions for compensation and related expenses associated with duplicative personnel; (2) the planned level of sales and marketing spend; and (3) cost reductions from elimination of duplicative operational expenses and vendors.  We aggregated operating segments into one reportable segment in accordance with ASC 280-10-50-11, because we concluded that: (1) both operating segments had similar economic characteristics; (2) both operating segments had similar products, production processes, customers, distribution methods and regulatory environments; and (3) aggregation would be consistent with the objectives and basic principles of ASC 280.   As our one aggregated operating segment accounted for 100% of our revenue, net income and assets, it constituted our sole reportable segment in 2015.
 
In 2016, we substantially realized the previously identified synergies and merged Endicia’s operations and employee groups into the existing consolidated structure which resulted in the CODM no longer needing to review Endicia’s performance and financial information separately.  As a result, the Company's CODM now reviews the financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating performance.  Based on our evaluation in accordance with ASC 280, including consideration of the ShippingEasy acquisition, we concluded that we had one operating segment in 2016. As our one operating segment accounted for 100% of our revenue, net income and assets, it constituted our sole reportable segment in 2016.
 
In 2014, all of our operations, revenue and assets were within the United States. In 2015 and 2016, primarily as a result of our Endicia acquisition, we had international revenue and assets that were less than 1% of total revenue and assets, with the remainder in the United States.

During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not recognize revenue from any one customer that represented 10% or more of our total revenues.
 
See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Results of Operations for years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Results of Operations for years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014,” for the percentage of total revenue contributed by categories of similar products or services that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenue. Our product and insurance revenues are subject to seasonal variations with the first and fourth calendar quarters being typically seasonally stronger and the second and third calendar quarters being typically seasonally slower. Our service revenue is subject to seasonal variation driven by our growth in packages shipped where the fourth calendar quarter is typically seasonally stronger due to the holiday shipping season and to a lesser extent, by customer acquisition which is typically seasonally stronger in the first and fourth calendar quarters and typically seasonally slower in the second and third calendar quarters. Our customized postage revenue is typically seasonally stronger in the fourth calendar quarter due to the holidays but can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on high volume business orders.
