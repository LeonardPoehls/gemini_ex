Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 
In this report, the terms “we,” “our,” “us” and “Company” refer to Reven Housing REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
 
Overview
 
We are an internally managed Maryland corporation that engages in the acquisition, ownership and operation of portfolios of leased single-family homes in the United States. We operate our portfolio properties as single-family rentals, or SFRs, and we generate most of our revenue from rental income from the existing tenants of the SFRs we have acquired. We intend to elect and qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2017.
 
As of December 31, 2017, we have invested an aggregate of approximately $60.4 million and own a total of 799 homes, of which 263 homes are in the Houston, Texas metropolitan area, 252 homes are in the Jacksonville, Florida metropolitan area, 120 homes are in the Memphis, Tennessee metropolitan area (with two of the Memphis homes located just across the border in Mississippi), 117 homes are in the Birmingham, Alabama metropolitan area, and 47 homes are in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area. Subsequent to year end on February 16, 2018, we purchased 27 additional homes in the Birmingham, Alabama metropolitan area for approximately $1,659,000 plus closing and acquisition costs.
 
We intend to expand our acquisitions to other select markets in the United States that fit our investment criteria as we continue to evaluate new investment opportunities in different markets. As of December 31, 2017, our portfolio properties were 91.2% occupied. Our portfolio properties have been acquired from available cash and with the proceeds from secured loan transactions with regional banks pursuant to which we had an outstanding principal amount owed of $31,005,586 as of December 31, 2017. Our loan transactions are secured by first priority liens and related rents on our homes. Subsequent to year end we increased our borrowings secured by Birmingham homes by $2,736,630.
 
Our principal objective is to generate cash flow and distribute resulting profits to our stockholders in the form of distributions, while gaining home price appreciation, or HPA, at the same time through the ownership of our portfolio properties. With this objective in mind, we have developed our primary business strategy of acquiring portfolios of stabilized or leased SFRs. We believe the execution of this strategy will allow us to generate immediate and steady cash flow from the rental income from the SFRs that we acquire while potentially gaining significant HPA over time. HPA is a metric most of our competitors use to project total returns. We believe cash flow is a better metric to project returns because cash flow is realized currently while HPA is unrealized and deferred until the assets are sold. While our goal is to grow our company and generate available cash flow from the rental income of our SFRs that will allow us to pay all of our operating costs for the operation of our portfolio properties and distribute profits to our stockholders in the form of quarterly dividends, there can be no assurance we will be able to do so.
 
Our History and Structure
 
In 2012, Chad M. Carpenter, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, recognized an opportunity to acquire portfolios of leased homes with positive cash flow and then distribute resulting profits to stockholders. To capitalize on this opportunity, Mr. Carpenter acquired a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock in July 2012 and founded Reven Housing REIT. Since then, we have been engaged in our current business of acquiring, owning and operating portfolios of leased single-family homes as rental properties.
 
Our company was originally incorporated on April 26, 1995. On April 1, 2014, we converted from a Colorado corporation to a Maryland corporation pursuant to applicable state conversion statutes to better position our company to qualify and operate as a REIT. In connection with our conversion to a Maryland corporation, we adopted our current charter and bylaws in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland.

Development of Our Business
 
Since January 1, 2017, we have undertaken the following material transactions and general development of our business:
 
Regional Bank Credit Facility - On January 31, 2017, we borrowed $5,020,000 from a regional bank pursuant to our issuance of a promissory note secured by deeds of trust on certain of our homes located in the Houston, Texas metropolitan area. Principal and accrued interest at a rate equal to four and one-half percent (4.50%) per annum are payable in 60 consecutive monthly installments based on a 20-year amortization period until January 31, 2022, when the entire amount of principal and interest remaining unpaid will be payable. Interest accrues and is payable monthly on the loan at a rate equal to four and one-half percent (4.50%) per annum until maturity.
Atlanta, Georgia - On March 15, 2017, we closed on the acquisition of 38 single-family homes located in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area for the purchase price of approximately $2,700,000 including closing expenses and acquisition costs.
Memphis, Tennessee – During March, April and June 2017, we closed on the acquisition of 26 single-family homes located in the Memphis, Tennessee metropolitan area for the purchase price of approximately $2,090,000 including closing expenses and acquisition costs.
Birmingham, Alabama - On April 19, 2017, we closed on the acquisition of 68 single-family homes located in the Birmingham, Alabama metropolitan area for the purchase price of approximately $5,300,000 including closing expenses and acquisition costs. An additional home was purchased in July 2017 for the purchase price of approximately $77,000 under the same contract. On December 29, 2017 we acquired an additional 48 homes pursuant to a separate purchase contract for a purchase price of approximately $2,837,000 including closing and acquisitions costs and net of repair credit allowances. Subsequent to year end on February 16, 2018, subject to another separate contract, we acquired 27 additional homes in Birmingham for a purchase price of approximately $1,659,000.
Regional Bank Loan Modification - On April 4, 2017, we entered into loan modification agreements with a regional bank on four notes in existence at December 31, 2016 whereby the interest rate on all four loans was modified from a rate of 1% over the prime rate to a fixed rate of 4.5% per annum. Principal and interest payments will be made monthly based on a 25- year amortization period with the remaining unpaid principal on all four loans due on April 5, 2020. The loans have a prepayment penalty of 2% during the first year and 1% during the following year on amounts paid in excess of the scheduled amortization. The other terms remain generally unchanged. The loans are secured by deeds of trust encumbering certain of our homes. The unpaid principal balance on these four loans was approximately $19,391,000 at December 31, 2017.
Additional Borrowings- On August 1, 2017, we received loan proceeds and issued a promissory note in the principal amount of $1,793,633 to a regional bank secured by our homes located in Georgia. Interest accrues at a fixed rate of 4.5% and monthly principal and interest payments will be made based on a 25-year amortization period with the remaining unpaid principal due July 5, 2020.
 
On August 22, 2017, we received loan proceeds and issued a promissory note in the principal amount of $1,155,000 to a regional bank secured by certain of our homes located in Tennessee. Interest accrues at a fixed rate of 4.5% and monthly principal and interest payments will be made based on a 25-year amortization period with the remaining unpaid principal due September 5, 2020.

On December 29, 2017, we received loan proceeds and issued a promissory note in the principal amount of $3,793,920 to a regional bank secured by certain of our homes located in Alabama. Interest accrues at a fixed rate of 4.25% and monthly principal and interest payments will be made based on a 20-year amortization period with the remaining unpaid principal due January 5, 2023. Subsequent to year end, on February 16, 2018, we received additional proceeds of $2,736,630 and the principal balance on this loan was increased to $6,530,550.
 
Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma- During the quarter ended September 30, 2017, a significant number of our properties in Houston and Jacksonville incurred storm related damages from Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma. We have estimated the extent of our asset impairments, damages and repairs to the properties to be approximately $2.8 million and have reduced our carrying values of our homes by that amount. The above amounts include losses relating to four of our homes that we determined were damaged beyond repair. We have estimated that approximately $2.3 million of the damages will be reimbursed in accordance with our insurance policies. The remaining $500,000 of repair costs represents amounts that will be paid from our available cash balances and are due to applicable deductible costs and uninsured costs. This amount has been included in casualty losses, net in the statement of operations and has been combined with the results from other casualty gains and losses not directly caused by the storm.
 
We have received approximately $950,000 for Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma related damages from our insurers as of December 31, 2017. The remaining $1.4 million expected to be recovered has been included in our other assets as of year-end.
 
We are actively repairing our damaged homes in both Houston and Jacksonville and anticipate that all properties will be restored to their original operating condition or better. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had spent approximately $1.5 million in repairs relating to hurricane damages to its homes.
 
Our Competitive Advantages
 
We believe that our competitive advantages include the following:
 
Our Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy of acquiring already improved, stabilized and currently leased portfolios of single-family homes and operating them as rental properties allows us to focus on generating positive cash flow and distributing the resulting profits to our stockholders. Our business strategy differentiates us from most of our competitors because they are buying empty homes individually as opposed to purchasing rented homes in bulk or are focused on generating home price appreciation. We believe our business strategy is efficient and cost effective because we do not need a large staff or to incur significant overhead costs in order to grow and execute our business plan.
Internal Management
 
As an internally-managed REIT, our executives are dedicated to our business allowing us to maintain greater control over the management and operation of our business than externally-managed REITs. Our management’s interests are aligned with those of our stockholders and we are exposed to fewer conflicts of interest than those typically faced by externally-managed REITs. Additionally, as our portfolio grows, we believe that we will achieve greater operational efficiencies and realize superior economies of scale as compared to externally-managed companies.
Experienced Management Team
 
We believe the real estate and institutional investment experience of our management team will lead our company to achieve our growth goals. Our management team is led by our founder, Chad M. Carpenter, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Carpenter, along with Thad L. Meyer, our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Secretary, are both experienced institutional real estate veterans, each with more than 25 years of residential and commercial real estate experience in both public and private real estate companies. Along with Michael P. Soni, our Senior Advisor of Investments, who also serves as our asset manager, our seasoned management team has more than 55 years of collective commercial and residential real estate investment, leasing and operational experience and has been involved in over $3.0 billion of real estate transactions. Members of our management team, including their experiences prior to joining our company, have inspected over 3,000 single-family residences and acquired approximately 800 single-family residences to rent or rehabilitate and sell in 12 states, including Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas. Our management team has established excellent relationships with brokers, sellers, institutional investors, policymakers, lenders, and aggregators of residential assets and has a proven track record in acquiring, managing and selling residential and commercial real estate.

Disciplined Acquisition Strategy
 
We have developed a disciplined, efficient, and cost-effective process to acquire assets that meet or exceed our conservative underwriting criteria, a thorough due diligence process and financial return requirements. We seek to continue acquiring portfolios of occupied single-family homes in bulk from investors who acquired, rehabilitated and rented them to qualified tenants and that have the potential for increased yield and appreciation. In addition, we believe we can achieve greater economies of scale by focusing our acquisitions in select markets and communities where there are established property management, general contractor and vendor relationships, and greater concentration of assets.
Extensive Sourcing Network
 
Our management team has cultivated and developed a wide network of industry relationships over the years, which we believe provides our company with a distinct competitive advantage to source a greater number of off-market transactions. Through this network, we have been able to source attractive portfolio acquisitions, and we believe they may provide us with additional attractive privately negotiated acquisition opportunities that in some cases may not be available to other market participants. We believe that this can result in more favorable pricing for acquisitions than if we were bidding on fully marketed deals. Our acquisitions team is in regular communication with sourcing contacts and sends out frequent and regular emails to update our underwriting criteria and to account for changes in current market and economic conditions. We provide agents and investors with specific acquisition criteria regarding the type of dwelling, location, condition of property, and price points so that they can concentrate their efforts exclusively on properties that meet our criteria. We maintain a database of potential sourcing contacts that is updated on a regular basis.
Our Business and Growth Strategies
 
Our objective is to be a leader in the single-family rental business as an institutional-quality operator on a national scale. Our focus is on cash flow and profitability while generating meaningful distributions from rental income and the potential for capital appreciation. We believe we can achieve this objective through the following strategies:
Disciplined Investment Strategy and Institutional Platform
 
We intend to grow by acquiring portfolios of single-family homes with cash flow in place in portfolios in select markets throughout the United States where economic forecasts are favorable for our business. Such forecasts include increasing rental rate growth and home price appreciation, increasing population migration and increasing job growth. Other factors that are as important are decreasing unemployment rates, decreasing cap rates and vacancies. We have strict investment criteria and detailed due diligence policies for each acquisition with formal investment committee meetings for review and approvals which creates an institutional culture and platform.
Create a Diversified Stabilized Portfolio
 
We currently own leased portfolios in the Atlanta, Georgia, Houston, Texas, Jacksonville, Florida, Memphis, Tennessee, and Birmingham, Alabama metropolitan areas and intend to expand into other select markets in the United States that fit our strict investment criteria. These targeted markets include selected cities in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Utah and Virginia. We believe that our planned expansion into these markets will help us achieve a diversified portfolio.

Keep a Low Cost and Efficient Overhead Structure
 
Our business strategy and platform allow us to maintain a lean, qualified team, keeping overhead costs down while efficiently managing vendors on an outsourced basis through active oversight and reporting. Unlike many of our competitors, we do not require nor maintain a large staff for acquisitions because we acquire investments through purchases of portfolios, not individual homes. Similarly, because we target and acquire homes that are leased and are otherwise in rent-ready condition, we do not require nor maintain a large staff for asset management or significant resources for renovating the homes. Additionally, by outsourcing property management functions to qualified and locally based property managers, we can focus our capital, resources and efforts that would otherwise be used to build in-house property management on operations and growth.
Locally-Based Property Management
 
Property management is a critical part of our business, and we believe this important function is a low margin and local business given the disparate nature of our assets and the unique characteristics of each home and the markets in which they are located. We believe that keeping maintenance and other operating costs under strict control and supervision is paramount to generating acceptable rental yields and maximizing the price appreciation of our assets. As such, we outsource our property management functions to independent, qualified, locally based property management teams who are experienced and familiar with the local markets in which they operate. We in turn manage the outsourced property managers to operate within our policies, procedures and budgets. By outsourcing the property management function of our business, our executives can better utilize their efforts, time and resources to focus on acquisitions and asset management rather than building a low-margin in-house property management arm, which we believe will allow us to achieve higher returns for our stockholders. We believe this is an efficient strategy for us at this stage of our development and furthers our growth.
Reporting for Operations
 
We utilize currently available cloud-based management information systems that will enable comprehensive tracking, management and control of all required functions within a cost-efficient and scalable environment as recommended by our select outside property management professionals. We believe that these tools will facilitate effective and cost-efficient management of disparate assets, scale our platform, and sustain operating margins as we continue to grow. These systems will also enable management to comply with strict regulatory compliance and governance requirements and will empower field personnel to respond autonomously within established corporate and budgetary parameters.
Our Business Activities and Operations
 
As of December 31, 2017, we have invested an aggregate of approximately $60.3 million and own a total of 799 homes, of which 263 homes are in the Houston, Texas metropolitan area, 252 homes are in the Jacksonville, Florida metropolitan area, 120 homes are in the Memphis, Tennessee metropolitan area (with two of the Memphis homes located just across the border in Mississippi), 117 homes are in the Birmingham, Alabama metropolitan area, and 47 homes are in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area. Subsequent to year-end, on February 16, 2018 we purchased an additional 27 homes in Birmingham for approximately $1,659,000.

Our Investment Process
 
Our investment strategy is to acquire portfolios of tenant-occupied houses with cash and/or limited partnership interests of our operating partnership, or OP units, from investors who have accumulated homes and who are now looking for an exit strategy. The evaluation and execution of our portfolio acquisitions are subject to the review and approval by our investment committee, which operates under the oversight of our Board of Directors and is currently comprised of Chad M. Carpenter, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Xiaofan (Fred) Bai, a member of our Board of Directors, Xiahang (Jake) Bai, a member of our Board of Directors, Thad L. Meyer, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and Michael P. Soni, our Senior Advisor of Investments. We have developed and integrated the following proprietary processes in the implementation of our investment strategy.
Balanced Value Approach for Investing
 
Our acquisition strategy is based upon extensive research and utilizes a proprietary acquisitions algorithm that focuses on acquiring a balance of portfolios of rented homes that have the potential for both increased yield and appreciation. We invest in markets that demonstrate strong and/or improving economic performance which will support the potential for rent increases and home appreciation. When approaching a market, we focus on factors such as the strength of rental demand, rates of job growth, population growth and unemployment. Within markets that meet our investment criteria, we seek to identify the neighborhoods that offer the most attractive mix of rental demand and rental rates, which are often characterized by good access to transportation networks and employment centers, good schools and low levels of crime. We believe this “balanced value” approach towards investing will help our investments achieve sustainable profitability at all times and through all cycles. This balanced value approach is intended to offer stockholders diversification, distributions, appreciation, liquidity and a lower risk investment.

• | Types of houses. In terms of the structural or physical characteristics of the houses we acquire, we typically buy single-family residences with at least three bedrooms and at least two bathrooms. Houses are built with a combination of brick, stone, stucco, siding, and wood with updated windows and young to medium age roofs. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Market selection process. To gather market research we use a third-party services to analyze conditions in our target residential U.S. markets, using such economic data as home values, employment growth, population growth, and thus access real estate market risk in these areas. We focus on markets that have the following characteristics: 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Projected real estate appreciation over the next three years
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


o | Projected job growth
--+---------------------


o | Lower current unemployment than the national average
--+-----------------------------------------------------


-10-
----


o | Rising rents
--+-------------


o | Stable and/or growing population with a minimum population of 500,000 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Stable and/or dropping vacancy rates
--+-------------------------------------


• | Target markets. We invest in markets that we believe have more upside value through the potential for rent increases and appreciation of the homes due to the dislocation of perceived values of the real estate and current rental rates that allow us to achieve higher than average rental yields and thus will also support higher than average future value appreciation. We are currently targeting the following markets, which include new markets and existing markets for further expansion: 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Phoenix, AZ | Atlanta, GA | Memphis, TN 
--------------------+--------------------+-------------------------
Tucson, AZ | Chicago, IL | Nashville, TN 
Central California | Indianapolis, IN | Dallas, TX 
Birmingham, AL | Louisville, KY | Fort Worth-Arlington, TX
Denver, CO | Las Vegas, NV | Houston, TX 
Fort Lauderdale, FL | Charlotte, NC | Irving, TX 
Jacksonville, FL | Raleigh, NC | San Antonio, TX 
Miami, FL | Virginia Beach, NC | Salt Lake City, UT 
Orlando, FL | Oklahoma City, OK | Richmond, VA 
Tampa, FL | Tulsa, OK | 

 
Using 3-year aggregate home value forecast from third party providers, we sort markets (as listed above) based on projected growth. Those markets that have higher projected growth are perceived to be lower risk, and yield a lower cap rate per class, than those markets that have lower or no growth projection over the next three years.
 

• | Zip code analysis. Our properties are intended to appeal to the following tenant profile: 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Middle-income blue-collar/gray-collar/semi-professional individuals and families 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Incomes ranging from $25,000 to $50,000 per year
--+-------------------------------------------------


o | Aged 30 years and above
--+------------------------


o | Preference for families to reduce turnover and related expenses
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
Since we target only tenant-occupied properties, we focus on submarkets where we expect that the majority of tenants will fit this profile. In the event that they do not, we will replace them with our targeted tenant profile on lease renewal.
 
Our zip code analysis focuses on the following metrics:
 

o | Average household income
--+-------------------------


o | White collar jobs
--+------------------


o | Average household size
--+-----------------------


o | Total crime risk (including utilizing FBI statistics)
--+------------------------------------------------------


o | Weather risk

Sourcing and Evaluation of Assets for Acquisition
 
Our management executives and investment professionals maintain existing relationships and continually develop new relationships in our network of contacts providing us access to potential portfolios of properties that meet our investment criteria. We provide contacts in our sourcing network with our specific investment criteria regarding the type of dwelling and specific home characteristics, location, condition of property, and price points so that efforts are concentrated solely on the properties that are potentially viable for investment by us. We are in regular communication with portfolio sourcing contacts and send out frequent and regular emails updating investment criteria to adapt to changes due to market fluctuations or other factors affecting our acquisitions model. All contacts and communications with them are logged in a central database to ensure we have current and correct sourcing information as we continually build and maintain our sourcing network. We believe the vast majority of SFR portfolios are available on an off-market basis due to the fragmentation of the SFR income-producing asset market, lack of institutional and other large buyers, and the local vs. national nature of the assets.
 

• | Sources of deal flow. We source potential SFR portfolios from a variety of sources in our network to optimize deal flow of our target assets, which sources include: 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Residential brokers specializing in income-producing properties 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Loopnet — online database of properties and brokers 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Trulia — online database of properties and brokers 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Existing SFR funds attempting to liquidate holdings and/or realize profits on flips 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Property Wholesalers — groups that acquire damaged homes and/or foreclosed homes in order to rehabilitate, rent, flip, and manage 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac for tenant-occupied portfolios available for bid 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | SFR conferences
--+----------------


o | Existing contacts
--+------------------


o | Homebuilders
--+-------------


• | Building a network. Our executives maintain existing relationships with a wide variety of relevant contacts that will allow access for many potential portfolios of properties. In addition, these agents, investors and other contacts are supplied with our specific investment criteria regarding type of dwelling and specific home characteristics, location, condition of property, and price points so that efforts are concentrated solely on the properties that are potentially viable for investment by us. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Managing the network. We are in continuous communication with portfolio sourcing contacts and send out frequent and regular emails updating investment criteria when there are changes due to market fluctuations or other factors affecting our acquisitions model. All contacts are logged in our proprietary contact database to ensure we have correct contact information. Further, each contact receives their own email file and all communications are filed appropriately in order to keep records of all conversations. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Initial informational requirement. All sourcing contacts in our network are requested to provide us with the following information for each house to ensure that we can quickly and productively qualify a portfolio for acquisition: market, address, zip code, type (SFR or town homes), rent, actual taxes, insurance, year built, square footage, # of bedrooms, # of bathrooms, asking price, lease expiry, Section 8/non-Section 8, and one exterior picture of the house. Based on the foregoing information we are able to verify whether the portfolio is in one of our target markets, assign housing classes based on year built, beds, baths, and pictures, sum actual tax and insurance expenses, and determine average rent for the portfolio. We can also determine from the above information the duration for current leases. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once a portfolio has been identified as appropriate for acquisition based on our investment criteria it is subjected to a rigorous evaluation process. This process includes a multi-tiered investment committee process ranging from pre-committee to final committee meetings. This process will ensure that all members of the investment committee agree with the findings from the due diligence period and that the portfolio in question is an appropriate investment for the company and its stockholders. The due diligence process includes case scenario financial modeling and sensitivity analysis, zip-code and neighborhood analysis, physical inspections by qualified engineers, broker price opinion “BPO” analysis to verify valuations are consistent with the purchase price, title and legal review, and finally property manager vetting and qualification.
 
Acquisition and Underwriting
 
We have developed a disciplined, efficient, and cost-effective process to acquire assets that meet or exceed our conservative underwriting criteria, a thorough due diligence process and financial return requirements. We acquire properties via portfolio purchases or in bulk sourced from our network discussed above. Once we have qualified potential portfolios for purchase based on our acquisition criteria, we proceed with discussions with the seller in negotiating and executing a letter of intent setting forth the general terms for the purchase. Once we have the letter of intent executed from the seller, we prepare documentation for review by our investment committee, including members of our executive management, where the entire initial underwriting is reviewed for approval. If and when approved, then we commence negotiation of the purchase contract with the seller and commence due diligence. Our acquisitions team continuously audits our underwriting assumptions, establishes property-specific business plans and tours and inspects each property before closing.

• | Professional BPO and valuation verification. During the preliminary underwriting phase we use Zillow and CMA analysis to arrive at valuations for market value. In addition, we utilize professional real estate firms to provide us with broker price opinions, or BPO, for valuations for each house. Each BPO is completed in a manner to ensure confidence in investment and pricing decisions. Two levels of technology-driven checks are used — data validation and a quality control rules engine — to identify duplicates and bring data together helping valuation professionals make accurate decisions. Each BPO is reviewed by staff analysts prior to delivery. This provides a final check against our valuation assumptions. We will only commence legal review of title and inspections if the valuation based on the BPOs are more than the total purchase price, otherwise we will endeavor to renegotiate the purchase price prior to incurring further due diligence costs.

• | Physical inspection and quality control. Once the professional BPOs have been received, and our existing valuation assumptions are proven correct, we utilize third-party professional engineers to conduct physical inspections of each house. The engineers provide us with reports based on the results of their inspections. These reports primarily focus on the following elements: site and pavements; structure; building envelope; mechanical, electrical and plumbing, or MEP; life safety; and interior. The reports also provide commentary regarding the tenant and the neighborhood.

• | Purchase and sale contract renegotiation. Once the inspection period has ended and all of the diligence has been reviewed, including title and legal review, if certain aspects of the contract require further attention, we will then renegotiate those aspects of the contract. These items may include valuation problems that require a price deduction, unexpected deferred maintenance that must be deducted from the price, or dropping properties due to quality or other issues.

• | Closing. Within 30 days of the end of the inspection period we will close on the transaction. All rents will be pro-rated, tenant leases converted, service contracts cancelled, and deposits and keys delivered.

Proactive Asset Management
 
Each time we acquire a portfolio of assets, we prepare portfolio specific budgets that provides clear instructions to, and parameters for, our asset management personnel. Michael P. Soni, our Senior Advisor of Investments, currently serves as our asset manager. We expect to hire additional asset managers and other asset management personnel as we continue to expand our operations. The asset management team’s primary responsibility will be to execute and adhere to these budgets. Our asset managers will utilize our property managers’ offices as required for meetings that will limit the need for regional offices and related expenses. Our asset managers will proactively manage the property managers to reduce expenses and implement customer retention plans to keep our tenants in place for longer periods to reduce turns, vacancy, releasing costs and increase stockholder returns. We also intend to hire third-party tax advisors to review and, if appropriate, appeal property tax bills every year to effectively manage our property tax expense.

The principal responsibilities of our asset management personnel will include:
 

• | Managing the budget for each asset and portfolios of assets. These budgets include occupancy goals, rent escalation objectives, asset improvements, leasing plans, return expectations, and recommendations as to which property management company to contract. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Managing the property managers. Asset managers will be responsible for training and managing the property managers. Asset managers hold weekly calls with the property managers to review leasing, collections, and repair expenditures. Asset managers will meet with each property manager to deliver and review the portfolios’ budgets to ensure that all parties who are involved in that portfolio understand our investment objectives and goals. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leasing. Asset managers will monitor occupancy for each portfolio on a weekly basis. Asset managers will be tasked to keep their respective portfolios leased at all times and ensure that tenants’ leases are being renewed prior to expiration. Asset managers will ensure that property managers maintain homes in rent-ready condition and begin the search for prospective tenants once tenants vacate a property. Leasing policies outline the leasing terms under which leases can be approved. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rent collection. Asset managers will monitor accounts receivable for each portfolio. In the event that tenants miss rent deadlines, the asset managers will follow up with the property managers to ensure that they have contacted the tenants to expedite the resolution of any issues. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reporting. Asset managers will review property management reports for each portfolio on a monthly basis and prepare monthly asset management reports. Asset managers will use property management reports to ensure that the property managers adhere to the portfolio’s budget and provide recommendations that add value to the asset or portfolio. Asset managers will monitor occupancy, rent collection, expenses, insurance, maintenance and other cap-ex closely and will ensure that property managers take all necessary steps to keep budgets on track. Asset managers will meet quarterly with senior management to review the performance of each portfolio.

• | Disposition. Asset managers will review and consider all purchase offers we receive on any asset in our portfolio and then in turn provide the terms of the offer and their evaluation to senior management. In evaluating whether to sell any such asset, we will consider, among other things, tax considerations in respect of our qualification and compliance as a REIT, the capital appreciation of the asset, and the gain from the disposition. In the event proposed offers and dispositions are approved by us, our asset managers will sell houses through a listing process with instructions that are previously approved by us.

Property Management
 
We generally outsource our property management function to the existing property managers that are in place when we acquire a portfolio of assets. All of our properties are managed by third-party property managers, with the same property manager managing all of the properties that are located within the same metropolitan area. In obtaining these services, we first determine that these property managers can provide the services we need and operate under our oversight and within the budget developed specifically for that portfolio. Our property managers provide services to us pursuant to management agreements that provide for one-year terms and are mutually terminable with 30 days’ prior notice. For their services, we pay our property managers management fees ranging from 7 – 8% of gross rental receipts from the properties they manage plus leasing fees for renewing tenants and new tenants, as well as 50% of any late fees assessed on the tenants. Property managers assist us in executing the budgets we have developed for each portfolio they manage.

The principal responsibilities of our property managers include:
 

• | Leasing. Property managers monitor occupancy for each portfolio on a daily basis. Property managers are tasked to keep their respective portfolios leased at all times and will ensure that tenants’ leases are being renewed prior to expiration. Property managers will ensure that the homes they manage are maintained in rent-ready condition if vacated. Property managers serve as our local leasing agents if they are qualified and have a proven track record. Additionally, property managers are instructed to use their best efforts to encourage tenants to renew leases with annual rental increases. If the situation warrants we will approve and provide certain incentives such as free rent or minor improvements in an effort to encourage tenants to enter into leases more quickly and to enter into leases with longer lease terms. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tenant retention. We regularly work with the property managers in implementing tenant retention programs. We believe that satisfied tenants will be more inclined to sign long-term leases and will provide a higher level of care for the property. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rent collection. Property managers monitor accounts receivable for each portfolio on a daily basis. Property managers are instructed to contact tenants and collect late charges quickly if tenants do not make their payments on time. Property managers are tasked to expedite the resolution of any issues and will be able to provide certain tenants with payment options upon approval from asset management. Property managers are instructed to evict tenants, if necessary, in a socially responsible and ethical process that is adapted and appropriate for each market. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regular home inspections. Property managers are required to perform drive-by inspections of all properties they manage and perform interior inspections every six months to ensure all homes are being well maintained by the tenants in order to avoid any serious and costly issues. Property managers document all interior inspections and submit photographs and focus on the property’s structure, foundation, roof, plumbing, furnace, water heaters, air conditioners, mechanical systems and appliances. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reporting. Property managers prepare property management reports for each portfolio of assets that they manage to provide to the asset manager on a monthly basis. These reports focus on occupancy, rent collection, actual expenses incurred vs. budget, and cap-ex requirements/budgets. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Managing the tenant and vendor relationships. Property managers manage the tenant and vendor relationships for our company. We strive to ensure that each property manager adheres to our professional values, ethics, conduct and decorum when interacting with tenants and vendors on our behalf. We are committed to responsibility and responsiveness in providing landlord services to our tenants and endeavor to create and maintain positive relationships with our tenants and service providers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintenance calls. Property managers field all maintenance calls. Property managers are empowered to hire vendors to address issues and are tasked to keep repair and/or maintenance costs within predefined and approved budgets. For items and actions that fall outside pre-approved expenditures, property managers are required to discuss with asset management to determine and take the appropriate action. Property managers are also required to respond to emergency calls.

Management Information Systems and Technology
 
We utilize currently available cloud-based management information systems that enable comprehensive tracking, management and control of all required functions within a cost-efficient and scalable environment as recommended by our select outside property management professionals. We believe that these tools facilitate effective and cost-efficient management of disparate assets, scale its platform, and sustain operating margins as we continue to grow. These systems enable management to comply with strict regulatory compliance and governance requirements and empower field personnel to respond autonomously within established corporate and budgetary parameters. Corporate email and business productivity tools are deployed under SaaS (software-as-a-service) licensing arrangements to eliminate hardware and maintenance costs while improving performance and reliability.
Competition
 
We face competition from many entities engaged in real estate investment activities, including individuals, other real estate investment companies, including newly formed REITs, and real estate limited partnerships. Our competitors may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, having substantially more available capital, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. Further, the market for the rental of properties is highly competitive. We also face competition from new home builders, investors and speculators, as well as homeowners renting their properties.

Risk Management
 
We face various forms of risk in our business ranging from broad economic, housing market and interest rate risks, to more specific factors, such as credit risk related to our tenants, re-leasing of properties and competition for properties. We believe that the systems and processes developed by our experienced executive team since commencing our real estate investment operations in July 2012 will allow us to monitor, manage and ultimately navigate these risks.
Insurance
 
We maintain property and liability insurance coverage related to our SFR properties, and workers’ compensation coverage for our employees. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits under our insurance program are appropriate and adequate for our business and properties given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. However, our insurance coverage is subject to substantial deductibles and carve outs, and we will be self-insured up to the amount of such deductibles and carve outs.
Regulation
 
General
 
Our properties are subject to various covenants, laws and ordinances and certain of our properties are also subject to the rules of the various HOAs where such properties are located. We believe that we are in compliance with such covenants, laws, ordinances and rules, and we also require that our tenants agree to comply with such covenants, laws, ordinances and rules in their leases with us.
Fair Housing Act
 
The Fair Housing Act, or FHA, its state law counterparts and the regulations promulgated by HUD and various state agencies, prohibit discrimination in housing on the basis of race or color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status (including children under the age of 18 living with parents or legal custodians, pregnant women and people securing custody of children under the age of 18), handicap or, in some states, financial capability. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the FHA and other regulations.
Environmental Matters
 
As a current or prior owner of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, and we could be liable to third parties as a result of environmental contamination or noncompliance at our properties, even if we no longer own such properties. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry Generally — Contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition.”
 
REIT Qualification
 
We intend to elect to qualify as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2017. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the percentage of income that we earn from specified sources, the percentage of our assets that fall within specified categories, the diversity of our capital stock ownership, and the percentage of our earnings that we distribute. We believe that we have been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and that our intended manner of operation will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT.

So long as we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a REIT. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income or property.
 
Investment Company Act of 1940
 
We intend to conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had three full-time employees. Additionally, Michael P. Soni, our Senior Advisor of Acquisitions and our asset manager, provides full-time services to us on a consultancy basis.
