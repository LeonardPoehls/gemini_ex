Overview of the Company
 
Cogentix Medical is a global medical device company headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota, with additional operations in New York, Massachusetts, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom.  We design, develop, manufacture and market a robust line of high performance fiberoptic and video endoscopy products under the PrimeSightTM brand that are used across multiple surgical specialties in diagnostic and treatment procedures.  We also offer the Urgent® PC Neuromodulation System, a device that delivers percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (“PTNS”), for the office-based treatment of overactive bladder (“OAB”).  OAB is a chronic condition that affects approximately 40 million adults in the U.S.  The symptoms include urinary urgency, frequency and urge incontinence.  We also offer Macroplastique® Implants, an injectable urethral bulking agent for the treatment of adult female stress urinary incontinence that is primarily due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency.
 
The PrimeSight flexible endoscopes are used in conjunction with the proprietary sterile, single-use microbial barrier known as the EndoSheath® Protective Barrier. Because the EndoSheath Protective Barrier is placed over the patient contact area of the scope, it eliminates the need for high-level disinfection between cases.  This allows a scope to be ready in substantially less time than with conventional reprocessing. Key advantages to the PrimeSight Endoscopes when used with the EndoSheath Protective Barrier are reduction in costs and time associated with traditional reprocess, increased practice productivity and patient throughput. In addition, the Protective Barrier isolates the endoscope from patient contact and protects the endoscope controls from contamination.   The PrimeSight Endoscopy line also includes rigid endoscopes and highly portable peripherals such as the video system and stroboscopy unit.

We primarily target the urology market space for our PrimeSight Endoscopy line.  We manufacture, market and sell our cystoscopy systems and EndoSheath protective barriers to urologists, urogynecologists and gynecologists.
 
We also manufacture, market, and sell our:  (i) bronchoscopy systems (an endoscope that allows detailed viewing of the lungs) and EndoSheath Protective Barrier to intensivists, pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons, and other airway-related physicians,  (ii) transnasal esophagoscopy (“TNE”) systems and EndoSheath Protective Barrier to general surgeons, primarily bariatric and gastroesophageal reflux disease (“GERD”) surgeons, and  (iii) ear, nose and throat (“ENT”) endoscopy systems to ENT physicians and speech pathologists.
 
Our Urgent® PC Neuromodulation System (“Urgent PC System”) is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) cleared, minimally invasive nerve stimulation device designed for office-based treatment of OAB and the associated symptoms of urge incontinence, urinary urgency and urinary frequency.  Using a small-gauge needle electrode inserted above the ankle, our Urgent PC System delivers electrical impulses to the tibial nerve that affects the sacral nerve plexus, a control center for pelvic floor and bladder function.  Components of our Urgent PC System include a 34 gauge needle electrode, a lead set and an external, handheld, battery-powered stimulator.  For each 30-minute office-based therapy session, the physician or other qualified health care provider inserts the needle electrode above the ankle and connects the electrode to the stimulator.  Typically, a patient undergoes a course of 12 consecutive weekly treatments, and, subsequently, a personal treatment plan of single treatments at a lesser frequency to sustain the therapeutic effect.  We believe physicians prefer our Urgent PC System because it offers effective therapies for patients that can be administered in an office setting and provides the physicians with a profitable revenue stream.  We believe patients prefer the Urgent PC System to pharmaceutical treatment options or surgeries because it is a minimally invasive treatment alternative that does not have the side effects associated with pharmaceutical treatment options or the adverse events associated with surgeries.
Macroplastique® (“Macroplastique”) is an injectable, urethral bulking agent for the treatment of adult female stress urinary incontinence primarily resulting from intrinsic sphincter deficiency.  It is designed to restore the patient’s urinary continence immediately following treatment.  Macroplastique is a soft-textured, permanent implant injected, under endoscopic visualization, around the urethra distal to the bladder neck.  It is a proprietary composition of heat vulcanized, solid, soft, irregularly shaped polydimethylsiloxane (solid silicone elastomer) implants suspended in a biocompatible excretable carrier gel.  We believe our compound is better than other commercially available bulking agents because, with its unique composition, shape and size, it does not degrade, is not absorbed into surrounding tissues and does not migrate from the implant site.
Recent Developments
 
Merger of Uroplasty and Vision-Sciences to Create Cogentix
 
On December 21, 2014, Vision-Sciences entered into a merger agreement with Uroplasty, a publicly traded corporation.  The Merger agreement provided for the Merger of Uroplasty with and into a newly created, wholly-owned merger subsidiary of Vision-Sciences.  Following the approval of the Merger by Vision-Sciences’ and Uroplasty’s stockholders on March 30, 2015 and pursuant to the terms of the Merger agreement, on March 31, 2015, Uroplasty merged with and into Merger Sub, with the Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vision-Sciences under the name, “Uroplasty, LLC.”  Vision-Sciences changed its name to “Cogentix Medical, Inc.” immediately following the Merger and our common stock now trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the new symbol “CGNT.”
 
The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition due to a number of factors including the relative voting interests in the combined company of the former Vision-Sciences and Uroplasty stockholders following the Merger.  As a result, Uroplasty and its consolidated subsidiaries represent the accounting acquirer in the Merger, and Vision-Sciences and its consolidated subsidiary represent the legal acquirer in the Merger.  Accordingly, while Vision-Sciences was the legal acquirer in the Merger, Uroplasty is treated as the acquiring company in the Merger for accounting purposes, and the Merger has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.
 
Change in Fiscal Year
 
We are presenting our results of operations for the twelve-month calendar year ended December 31, 2016 and the nine-month transition period ended December 31, 2015.  Unless otherwise indicated herein, comparisons of fiscal year results in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” portion of this Annual Report, and elsewhere herein, compare results for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016 to the nine-month transition period from April 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, and accordingly are not comparing results for a comparable period of time.

Accelmed Investment and Pell Debt Conversion
 
 On September 7, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Accelmed Growth Partners, L.P. (“Accelmed”).  Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Accelmed agreed to purchase 16,129,033 shares of our common stock at $1.55 per share, for an aggregate price of $25.0 million.  As a condition to Accelmed closing the equity investment, we agreed to convert into shares of our common stock all of the outstanding debt and accrued interest owed to Lewis C. Pell, one of our directors.  On September 7, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with Mr. Pell (the “Note Exchange Agreement”) under which the debt we owed to Mr. Pell would be converted into our common stock at a price per share of $1.67 prior to closing the Purchase Agreement.  The Note Exchange Agreement also provided that, simultaneously with the conversion of such debt, all outstanding warrants to purchase our common stock that are held by Mr. Pell would be cancelled.
 
On November 3, 2016, our stockholders approved the transactions described above, and these transactions closed on November 3, 2016.  We converted the outstanding principal amount, approximately $28.5 million, and accrued interest, approximately $1.0 million, on our promissory notes held by Mr. Pell into 17,688,423 shares of our common stock.  We also issued 16,129,033 shares of our common stock to Accelmed in exchange for $25.0 million.  As a result of the transactions described above, Mr. Pell and Accelmed own or control approximately 33% and 27%, respectively, of the outstanding common stock of the Company as of December 31, 2016.
 
In connection with the Purchase Agreement, Accelmed and Mr. Pell entered into a voting agreement (the “Voting Agreement”).  Pursuant to the terms of the Voting Agreement, Mr. Pell and Accelmed have agreed to vote their shares of the Company’s common stock for the other party’s nominees to the board of directors.  Under the Voting Agreement, each of Mr. Pell and Accelmed are entitled to nominate two directors, with the remaining seats to be filled by nominees that are mutually agreed upon by Mr. Pell and Accelmed in accordance with the terms of the Voting Agreement. The Voting Agreement is intended, in part, to qualify the Company as a “Controlled Company” under Nasdaq Rule 5615(c)(2), which permits the Company to utilize the controlled company exemption to the independent director requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605.  Additionally, under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed that one of the directors nominated to the board by Accelmed shall serve as Chairman of the Board until Accelmed or its affiliates no longer own 50% of the shares purchased pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or unless otherwise agreed by Accelmed.  The Company also amended its bylaws to reduce the required quorum for all stockholder meetings to one-third of all issued and outstanding shares of voting stock of the Company. Further, the securities purchase agreement with Accelmed provides it with numerous protective provisions, including prohibiting the Company, without the prior approval of the Accelmed directors, from engaging in any merger, consolidation, transfer or conversion involving the Company, incurring any new indebtedness in excess of $10,000,000, and changing the size of the Board of Directors.
 
Overview of Strategy for Calendar Year 2017 and Beyond


Our strategy for calendar year 2017 and beyond is to continue to leverage our assets to generate organic growth and to expand our product portfolio through acquisition or otherwise.  We currently have a distribution platform that includes 52 direct sales representatives in the U.S., with 46 sales representatives serving the Urology, Urogynecology and Gynecology market and six sales representatives serving the non-Urology markets of Airway Management and Industrial markets.  Internationally, we have 8 direct sales representatives in various geographies and a network of distributor relationships.  We believe this sales force has the capacity to add more products to their existing portfolio, and a key element of our strategy is to continue to leverage this distribution platform to generate revenue growth.  We plan to expand our product portfolio through merger, acquisition, licensing or distribution opportunities.  We believe that there are underperforming yet innovative assets available that we can add to our portfolio and grow at double digit rates.  Examples of such assets include orphaned technologies within larger organizations, new technologies ready for commercialization with which our existing distribution platform can penetrate the market quickly, and existing products that are not meeting their potential due to undersized sales forces within their current company.
 
Our sales team’s primary focus continues to be on the sale of our PrimeSight urology portfolio and our Urgent PC System, both in the United States and internationally.  We will emphasize the “always ready, always sterile” attribute of our PrimeSight systems utilizing the EndoSheath Protective Barrier, as well as their ability to enable physicians to safely and cost-effectively treat more patients in less time, thereby providing physicians with flexibility to better manage increased patient demand.  We will continue to focus on generating greater patient and physician awareness of our Urgent PC system and on training physicians in the proper use and clinical benefits of our Urgent PC System for overactive bladder.  We do not expect to see significant growth in our Macroplastique business because we believe it is a small, mature market that is competitively penetrated.

PrimeSight Endoscopes and PrimeSight Digital Processing Units for Medical Use
 
In 2016, we initiated a program that brings the entire endoscopy portfolio under the company’s new PrimeSight brand. The PrimeSight Endoscopy family of products will encompass our state-of-the-art endoscopes, processors, accessories, as well as the endoscope-associated EndoSheath and EndoWipe products.
 
We have developed two visualization platforms for flexible endoscopy: fiber optic (4000 Series) and video (5000 Series and 7000 Series).  Our 4000 Series fiberscopes contain advanced fiber optic imaging systems with high quality functional aspects, such as small diameter endoscopes and portability options, through the use of a battery-powered light source.  Our lightweight, advanced, digital video-based endoscopes facilitate diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.  Our small diameter video endoscopes contain a high resolution, tiny charge-coupled device (“CCD”) camera at the tip of the scope, offering a sharp, vibrant, full screen image.  The 7000 Series and 5000 Series video endoscopes also feature pioneering functional aspects, including the elimination of an external light source, the inclusion of an integrated light emitting diode (“LED”), industry leading small diameter sizes and robust durability.
 
Our 7000 Series and 5000 Series of PrimeSight video endoscopes are utilized with our multi-functional video processor or DPU.  Unlike conventional video endoscopy “towers,” we have integrated key peripherals into a single all-in-one unit, providing a more cost-effective design that allows for maximum portability in various health care settings.  Our DPU provides high quality imaging along with workflow efficiency features and plug-and-play simplicity in operation. Users can easily capture video and images during various endoscopic procedures to patient files for future viewing.  Our LCD provides full screen presentation with no truncation (framing) of image, commonly seen in other endoscope manufacturer’s products. Along with our EndoSheath Protective Barrier, our DPU contributes significantly to portability by allowing bedside procedures where space is limited. Our DPU is also easily transported from facility to facility allowing physicians to perform video endoscopy even in the remotest locations. Our DPU includes a simplified user interface, programmable user preference controls, expanded on-screen notifications, and easy-to-maintain patient lists, all of which allow end-users to improve productivity and workflow by customizing the operation of the system to the day-to-day needs of the practice.  Additionally, the system incorporates a “one-touch” integrated keyboard to ensure quick activation of functions, including full control of video playback options, such as frame-by-frame review or historical image comparison, both of which are ideal for patient progress review.
 
In the U.S., we sell our endoscopes and sheaths through our direct sales force.  Internationally, our endoscopes and sheaths are sold primarily by distributors.

Urology Market.  Within the Urology market, we developed unique products for urology with our PrimeSight fiber and video cystoscopes, both utilizing the EndoSheath Protective Barrier.  Our cystoscopes consist of two components: (i) a reusable flexible endoscope incorporating our proprietary design, and (ii) a proprietary, sterile, single-use EndoSheath Protective Barrier.
 
Our PrimeSight line includes our advanced digital, video-based flexible cystoscopes, a CCD-based video imaging endoscopy system, which features an integrated built-in LED light source and operates with our all-in-one PrimeSight video processor or DPU.  We also market and distribute a fiber optic cystoscope.
 
Airway Management Market.  We developed unique products for the ENT, pulmonology/critical care and bariatric/gastrointestinal (“GI”) specialties.  We manufacture and market fiber and video laryngoscopes, which we refer to as ENT scopes.  Our fiber and video ENT scopes can be used with or without the EndoSheath Protective Barrier, as they do not feature any working channels and are diagnostic only.  We market and sell products for pulmonology using our fiber and video bronchoscopes.  Our bronchoscopes utilize our EndoSheath Protective Barrier and are inserted through the mouth or nose and into the lower airway, providing visualization of the lungs and the ability to perform a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. We have also developed a digital, video-based flexible TNE endoscope, which utilizes our EndoSheath Protective Barrier.  Our TNE system provides visualization of the esophageal anatomy via a sedation-free transnasal approach.  Each of our video airway management scopes is a CCD-based video imaging endoscopy system, which includes an integrated built-in LED light source and operates with our all-in-one DPU.
Endoscopes (Borescopes) and Digital Processing Units for Industrial Use
 
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Machida Incorporated (“Machida”), we design, manufacture and sell borescopes to a variety of users, primarily in the aircraft engine manufacturing and aircraft engine maintenance industries.  A borescope is an instrument that uses optical fibers or a small camera for the visual inspection of narrow cavities.  Our borescopes are used to inspect aircraft engines, cast parts and ground turbines, among other items.  Machida’s quality line of borescopes includes a number of advanced standard features normally found only in custom designed instruments.  We were the first to offer a flexible borescope with a grinding attachment, allowing users to “blend” or smooth small cracks in turbine blades of jet engines without disassembling the engine, saving our customers a significant amount of expense and time.
EndoSheath Protective Barrier
 
We have developed the EndoSheath Protective Barrier for use with our proprietary PrimeSight Endoscopes.  The protective barrier is made with materials using our proprietary process that makes the barrier material lubricious (smooth), allowing the health care practitioner to easily install the disposable onto the endoscope.  In addition, our protective barrier technology has an optically clear window that fits securely over the endoscope tip, providing a clear image.  Once installed, the protective barrier offers complete isolation between the endoscope and the patient.  After the procedure is completed, the barrier easily slides off and is removed from the endoscope and discarded.
 
Our EndoSheath Protective Barrier offers various-size working channels, unlike conventional flexible endoscopes, which have the working channel inside the endoscope itself, allowing our users to customize the scope to the procedure (e.g., diagnostic cystoscopy, which requires a small working channel, or therapeutic cystoscopy, which requires a larger working channel).  This enables us to provide procedure-specific EndoSheath Protective Barrier without requiring physicians to purchase a new endoscope for a different procedure.
 
Within the Urology market, we offer urologists two EndoSheath Protective Barrier models for each of our fiber and video cystoscopes: a diagnostic model with a 1.5mm working channel size that provides enhanced patient comfort, and a therapeutic model with a 2.1mm working channel size that provides the same capabilities as conventional cystoscopes.  Our protective barrier installs easily onto the cystoscope; it includes a covering for the endoscope and a working channel, which may be used for irrigation, suction and therapeutic tool delivery as well as an additional covering for the control body (handle), where the physician operates the cystoscope.  The protective barrier is the only component that comes into contact with the patient and is discarded after each procedure.
 
Within the TNE market, we market and distribute two EndoSheath Protective Barrier models for our video TNE endoscope: a diagnostic model with a 1.5mm working channel size, and a therapeutic model with a 2.1mm working channel size.  This unique feature of our EndoSheath Protective Barrier design provides gastroenterologists, ENT physicians, bariatric surgeons and others with two choices: a diagnostic model with a smaller overall diameter (due to a smaller working channel) for patient comfort, and a therapeutic model with a larger working channel, providing the same capabilities as conventional endoscopes.

Within the Pulmonology market, we market and distribute four EndoSheath Protective Barrier models for video and fiber bronchoscopy: a 1.5mm working channel, a 2.1mm working channel, a 2.8mm working channel (currently available outside of the U.S. only), and one without a working channel.  We are currently seeking clearance to market the 2.8mm channel model in the U.S.  The multiple sizes are necessary due to various procedures that are performed by pulmonologists and airway management physicians.  Depending on the type of procedure being performed, a pulmonologist or airway management physician may use a very small diameter model, with or without a working channel, or a larger diameter model with a working channel.
 
Always Ready, Always Sterile
 
In November 2015, the ECRI Institute (a nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing the discipline of applied scientific research to discovering which medical procedures, devices, drugs, and processes are best to improve patient care) listed inadequate reprocessing of flexible endoscopes and the potential for cross-contamination and patient infection as the number one most dangerous hazard on its list of the top-ten health technology hazards for 2016.  The use of our PrimeSight Endoscopy systems with the EndoSheath Protective Barrier allows health care providers to perform a simplified and efficacious reprocessing routine after their use of endoscopes, avoiding the elaborate – and sometimes inadequate - high level disinfection/sterilization routines required by the FDA for conventional endoscopes.  The FDA requires that all conventional flexible endoscopes be reprocessed according to FDA-cleared manufacturers’ instruction for use, whether they are used in hospitals, clinics or office settings.  With our protective barrier, we are able to prevent the endoscope from coming into contact with the patient and organic material during the procedure, reducing the steps needed to reprocess flexible endoscopes from approximately 27 to three, thereby saving time, lowering costs and reducing the complexity of the process.
 
This design of our “always ready, always sterile” equipment,  provides a multitude of benefits to health care practitioners, such as redefining health care economics by lowering per procedure costs through less capital equipment investment, less service and maintenance costs of capital equipment, less required use of toxic chemicals, increased patient scheduling flexibility and procedure volume, improved practice efficiency, and  the capacity to reallocate unproductive labor resources from reprocessing activities to more productive tasks of patient care and throughput.
 
Urgent PC Systems
 
Our Urgent PC System is an FDA-cleared, minimally-invasive, neuromodulation system that delivers PTNS for office-based treatment of OAB and the associated symptoms of urinary urgency, urinary frequency, and urge incontinence.  For each 30-minute office-based therapy session, the physician or other qualified health care provider inserts the small-gauge needle electrode above the ankle and connects the electrode to the stimulator.  Typically, a patient undergoes a course of 12 consecutive weekly treatments, and, subsequently, a personal treatment plan of single treatments at a lesser frequency to sustain the therapeutic effect.
 
For individuals with overactive bladder symptoms, the nervous system control for bladder filling and urinary voiding is incompetent.  For OAB patients, signals to indicate a full bladder are sent early and frequently, triggers to allow the bladder to relax for filling are ineffective, and nervous controls of the urethral sphincter to keep the bladder closed until an appropriate time are inadequate.  An individual with OAB may exhibit one or all of the symptoms that characterize overactive bladder: urinary urgency (i.e., the strong, compelling need to urinate), urinary frequency (i.e., repetitive need to void) and urge incontinence (i.e., involuntary loss of urine associated with an abrupt, strong desire to urinate).
 
When patients seek treatment for OAB, physicians normally start with conservative therapies such as biofeedback and behavioral modification (e.g., bladder training, scheduled voiding techniques and pelvic floor training).  When, as is often the case, these therapies are not entirely successful, the next treatment of choice is drug therapy.  If, as is the case with a majority of the patients, the drug therapy is ineffective or cannot be tolerated by the patient, the physicians suggest other treatments.  For those patients, we believe our minimally invasive Urgent PC System treatments offer an alternative to the more invasive treatments such as surgery, implantation of a sacral nerve stimulation device, or injection of OnabotulinumtoxinA, a prescription drug marketed under the name of Botox, into the bladder.

Macroplastique
 
Macroplastique is an injectable, urethral bulking agent for the treatment of adult female stress urinary incontinence primarily due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency (“ISD”).  Urinary incontinence is defined as the involuntary loss of urine and is the result of either bladder or urethral dysfunction.
 
In 2007, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases reported that, depending on the definition of urinary incontinence used, 5% to 50% of the U.S. adult population suffers from some form of urinary incontinence.  Per the American Urological Association, there are three types of urinary incontinence:
 
 
· | Stress Urinary Incontinence — Stress urinary incontinence (“SUI”) refers to the involuntary loss of urine due to an increase in intra-abdominal pressure from ordinary physical activities, such as coughing, sneezing, laughing, straining or lifting. SUI, the most common form of urinary incontinence among women, is estimated to affect almost 30 million women over the age of 18 in the U.S. (Hampel et al., 1997 and 2000 U.S. census data). SUI is caused by urethral hypermobility and/or ISD. Urethral hypermobility – abnormal movement of the bladder neck and urethra – can occur when the anatomic supports for the bladder neck and urethra have weakened. This anatomical change can result from pregnancy, childbirth or age-related tissue deterioration. SUI can also be caused by ISD, or the inability of the urinary sphincteric mechanism to function properly. ISD can be due to congenital or age-related sphincter weakness or can result from damage to the sphincteric mechanism following pelvic trauma, surgery, neurologic diseases or radiation therapy.

· | Urge Incontinence — Urge incontinence refers to the involuntary loss of urine associated with an abrupt, strong desire to urinate. Urge incontinence often occurs when neurologic problems cause the bladder to contract and empty with little or no warning, and is part of the overactive bladder syndrome. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Overflow Incontinence — Overflow incontinence is associated with an over-distention of the bladder. This can be the result of an under-active bladder or an obstruction in the bladder or urethra.

Macroplastique is an injectable, urethral bulking agent that is designed to restore the patient’s urinary continence immediately following treatment.  Macroplastique is a soft-textured, permanent implant injected, under endoscopic visualization, around the urethra distal to the bladder neck.  It is a proprietary composition of heat vulcanized, solid, soft, irregularly shaped polydimethylsiloxane (solid silicone elastomer) implants suspended in a biocompatible excretable carrier gel.  We believe our compound is better than other commercially available bulking agents because, with its unique composition, shape and size, it does not degrade, is not absorbed into surrounding tissues and does not migrate from the implant site.
 
We have sold Macroplastique for urological indications in over 40 countries outside the United States since 1991.  We began marketing Macroplastique in the United States in 2007.
 
Other Products and Applications
 
We also provide and market the following additional products and applications:
 
Macroplastique® for Vesicoureteral Reflux.  Outside the U.S., we market our Macroplastique products for treatment of vesicoureteral reflux - the abnormal backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureters or kidneys that is most prevalent in infants and children whose ureters did not fully develop.  In this application, a bolus of the elastomer implant is injected around the orifice or valve where the ureter enters the bladder.
 
PTQ® Implants.  We also market our silicone elastomer implants under the name PTQ® Implants outside of the U.S. as a minimally invasive product to address fecal incontinence (sometimes referred to as bowel incontinence).  Our PTQ Implants offer minimally-invasive, soft-textured permanent implant for treatment of fecal incontinence.  PTQ is implanted circumferentially into the submucosa of the anal canal, creating a “bulking” and supportive effect around the anal sphincter.  PTQ is CE marked and currently sold outside the United States in various international markets.
 
 8
 

Urgent PC for Fecal Incontinence.  Our Urgent PC System is CE marked and sold outside of the United States for the treatment of fecal incontinence.
 
VOX® Implants.  In addition to urological applications, we market our silicone elastomer bulking material outside the United States to help improve speech and swallowing function in patients with unilateral vocal cord paralysis.  The implants are sold for vocal cord rehabilitation applications under the trade name VOX® Implants.
 
Distributed Products.  In The Netherlands and United Kingdom only, we distribute certain wound care products in accordance with a distributor agreement.  Under the terms of the distributor agreement, we are not obligated to purchase any minimum level of wound care products.
Sales, Distribution and Marketing
 
Medical Products
 
The end users of our PrimeSight Endoscopy systems for medical use and related products primarily consist of urologists, pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons, gastroenterologists, bariatric surgeons, and ENT doctors in medical clinics, physicians’ private offices, ambulatory surgical centers, and hospitals.  Other physicians may also use our medical devices performing procedures in alternate settings.  The end users of our Urgent PC System and Macroplastique products are primarily urologists, urogynecologists and gynecologists with significant office-based and outpatient surgery-based patient volume.
 
We market and distribute these medical products worldwide.  In the U.S., we sell our products through a direct sales force.  Outside the U.S., we sell our products through a combination of a direct sales force and a network of distributor organizations.  Most of our distributors outside the U.S. also market and distribute products of other companies.
 
In the United States, we have a sales organization that consists of 52 direct field sales representatives, six Regional Sales Directors, and a marketing organization to market our products directly to our customers.  Of our 52 direct sales representatives, 46 specialize in the urology market and six specialize in the airway management and other markets.
 
Outside of the United States, we sell our Urgent PC System and Macroplastique products primarily through a direct sales organization in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Ireland, Belgium, Finland, Sweden and Denmark, and in all other markets primarily through distributors.  Each of our distributors has a territory-specific distribution agreement, including requirements they may not sell products that compete directly with ours.  Our PrimeSight Endoscopy systems and products are sold internationally primarily through national distributors.
 
We use clinical studies and worldwide scientific community awareness programs to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products.  Publications of clinical data in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at professional society meetings by clinical researchers increase the scientific community’s awareness of our products, including patient indications, treatment technique and expected outcomes.  We provide a range of activities designed to support physicians in their clinical research.
 
Borescopes for Industrial Use
 
Our borescopes are sold directly by our subsidiary, Machida, and through a global network of independent sales representatives.
 
We regularly evaluate the effectiveness of all of our sales channels and may change them if we believe a different method would increase our revenues.
 
Third-Party Reimbursement
 
In the United States as well as in foreign countries, sales of our medical products depend in significant part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers.  In the United States, third-party payers consist of government programs such as Medicare, private health insurance plans, managed care organizations and other similar programs.  For any product, three factors are critical to reimbursement:
 
 9
 

 
1. | coding, which ensures uniform descriptions of procedures, diagnoses and medical products;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | coverage, which is the payer’s policy describing the clinical circumstances under which the payer will pay for a given treatment; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | payment processes and amounts.
---+-------------------------------



Whether a particular procedure qualifies for third-party reimbursement depends upon factors such as the safety and effectiveness of the procedure. Reimbursement may be denied if the medical device used was experimental or was used for a non-approved indication.  We believe, based upon our knowledge and experience of third-party reimbursement practices and advice from consultants in this area, that third-party reimbursement is available for most procedures that utilize our products.
 
PrimeSight Endoscopes
 
Third-party payers use a variety of mechanisms to determine reimbursement amounts for procedures such as endoscopies.  In most cases, payment is based upon amounts determined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), a governmental agency under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  As part of its responsibilities, CMS assigns relative value units (“RVUs”) to over 10,000 physician services.  An RVU for a specific procedure is comprised of values for work, practice expense and malpractice insurance, and when multiplied by a conversion factor, represents a dollar value for a specific procedure.
 
 CMS has multiple fee schedules to accommodate payment to the hospital, the ambulatory surgery center, and the physician.  Physician services are reimbursed based on where the service is performed.  If the physician performs the service in his or her office and the office bears the burden of overhead costs, the physician is reimbursed based on non-facility RVUs to accommodate the overhead costs. If the physician performs the service in a hospital or the ambulatory surgery center, the payment to the physician is lower, reflecting the physician work and malpractice expenses, but without the overhead since the facility bears that financial burden.
 
We believe that the number of procedures performed in non-facility settings will increase.  As these procedures move to non-facility settings, physicians will have to contend with the cost and effort required to reprocess conventional endoscopes.  We believe our PrimeSight Endoscopy portfolio will provide an economically beneficial alternative to the use of conventional endoscopes based upon the provider not having to purchase multiple endoscopes or expensive disinfecting equipment and supplies, and not having to spend his or her valuable time cleaning endoscopes.  We believe that with over 100 million people in the U.S. over the age of 50, the number of endoscopic procedures that physicians will perform will increase.  Our EndoSheath technology, combined with the resource-based system for setting values for physician services, represents a sound economic solution for physicians to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in their offices.
 
EndoSheath Protective Barrier
 
Most third-party payers do not reimburse health-care providers separately for the cost of our sterile, single-use EndoSheath Protective Barrier products.
 
Urgent PC System
 
Sales of our Urgent PC System are significantly influenced by the availability of third-party reimbursement for PTNS treatments.  Effective January 2011, the American Medical Association granted a Category 1 Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) code for PTNS treatments.
 
As of February 2016, all regional Medicare carriers, with approximately 55 million covered lives, provide coverage for PTNS treatments.  In addition, we estimate that private payers insuring approximately 162 million lives provide coverage for PTNS treatments.
 
Outside of the U.S., our Urgent PC System treatments are reimbursed under an available reimbursement code in The Netherlands.  In other countries in Europe, there are no specific reimbursement codes for Urgent PC System treatments, and generally reimbursement is from fund-holder trusts or global hospital budgets.
 
Macroplastique
 
We believe there are appropriate CPT codes available to describe the use of Macroplastique to treat adult female stress urinary incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency in the United States.  Outside of the United States, government managed health care systems and private insurance control reimbursement for devices and procedures.  Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country.  In the European Union, reimbursement decision-making is neither regulated nor integrated at the European Union level.  Each country has its own system, often closely protected by its corresponding national government.  Reimbursement for Macroplastique has been successful in multiple international markets where hospitals and physicians have budgets approved by fund-holder trusts or global hospital budgets.

Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
We have FDA-registered manufacturing facilities in Minnetonka, MN, Westborough, MA and Orangeburg, NY where we manufacture all of our tissue bulking products, Endosheath products and Primesight products, respectively.  Our facilities use dedicated heating, cooling, ventilation and high efficiency particulate air filtration systems to provide cleanroom and other controlled working environments.  Our trained technicians perform all critical manufacturing processes in qualified environments according to validated written procedures.  We use qualified vendors to sterilize our products using validated methods.
 
PrimeSight Endoscopes
 
We manufacture our flexible endoscopes for medical and industrial use at our facility in Orangeburg, NY, using purchased components and subassemblies as well as certain proprietary components we or our subcontractors produce.  Some purchased components and subassemblies are available from more than one supplier. For most of our purchases, we have no long-term agreements with our vendors or suppliers, and we purchase our components and supplies on a purchase order basis. For certain critical components, we have long-term supply arrangements with third parties.
 
EndoSheath Protective Barrier
 
We currently manufacture our EndoSheath disposable barriers at our facility in Westborough, Massachusetts using raw materials, molded parts, and components purchased from independent vendors, some of which are manufactured to our specifications.  We also design and build our own production machines and tools.
 
Most components we purchase are available from multiple sources, with the exception of certain key components that are supplied to us by key suppliers, with whom we have long-term supply arrangements, but no long-term supply agreements.  We purchase our components and supplies on a purchase order basis and seek to maintain adequate inventory levels of such components to prevent supply disruptions.  We contract with third parties for the sterilization of all of our EndoSheath disposables.
 
Urgent PC System
 
We subcontract the manufacturing of both the stimulator and lead set components of our Urgent PC System. Each component is manufactured by a single source supplier meeting our quality and other requirements.  Although we believe our sources of supply could be replaced if necessary without undue disruption, it is possible that the process of qualifying new suppliers could cause an interruption in our ability to manufacture our products, which could have a negative impact on sales.
Macroplastique
 
Macroplastique and its related products VOX and PTQ are manufactured in the Minnetonka, MN facility using raw materials, molded parts and proprietary process methods.  The accessory products, including sterile needles and an administration device, are contract manufactured. The bulking agent is manufactured in onsite cleanroom facilities.  Due to the nature of the materials used and the regulatory obligations for the product, two key materials are provided by qualified single source suppliers.   We believe that the sources of the key materials could be replaced with minimal disruption to manufacturing; however it is possible that the process of qualifying a new vendor or equivalent material could cause an interruption that could negatively impact sales.
Competition
 
PrimeSight Endoscopy and EndoSheath Protective Barrier (Flexible Endoscopes and Disposables)
 
 11
 

We believe that the primary competitive factors in the medical device market for flexible endoscopes include safety and effectiveness, the optical quality of product offerings, product reliability, price, physician familiarity with the manufacturer and its products, ease of use and third-party reimbursement policies.
 
Our ability to compete is directly affected by several factors, such as our sales and marketing capabilities, our product development and innovation capabilities, our ability to obtain required regulatory clearances, our ability to protect the proprietary technology which our products are based upon, our manufacturing skills and our ability to attract and retain skilled employees.
 
We believe our proprietary PrimeSight Endoscopes and EndoSheath platform currently provides us with a competitive advantage over our competition.  Currently, most of our competitors sell endoscopes that require elaborate and time-consuming reprocessing procedures. Some newer competitors sell disposable endoscopes that sacrifice optical quality and functional performance in favor of single-use safety. Our unique platform provides the safety of a sterile, single use device as well as the performance of a high quality reusable device.
 
Our current and future medical endoscopes face global competition, primarily from companies such as Olympus, Pentax, and Karl Storz.  Some of our competitors and some potential competitors may have greater financial resources, experience, sales and marketing personnel and capabilities, research and development, and manufacturing personnel and capabilities than we do.  In addition, any company that is able to significantly redesign conventional flexible endoscopes to simplify or significantly improve their reprocessing, may result in competition for our products.
 
In our industrial markets, we believe that our over 35-year history of product effectiveness, ease of use, product reliability and competitive pricing are the principal competitive factors contributing to our success.  Among our competitors are Olympus, Lenox, and Karl Storz Industrial.
 
Urgent PC System
 
We believe our Urgent PC System offers a minimally invasive, office-based treatment alternative in the continuum of care for OAB patients.  Conservative therapies such as dietary restrictions, pelvic floor exercises, bladder retraining, biofeedback, and anticholinergic drugs usually precede our Urgent PC System treatments.  Anticholinergic medications that could be seen as competing with PTNS include Detrol® and Toviaz® (both by Pfizer Inc.); Ditropan® (Johnson & Johnson); Enablex® (Novartis AG); Sanctura® (Allergan, Inc.) and Vesicare® (GlaxoSmithKline plc).  These medications treat symptoms of OAB, some by preventing unwanted bladder contractions and others by tightening the bladder or urethra muscles or by relaxing bladder muscles.  We believe our Urgent PC System normally is prescribed after these drugs are used but discontinued because they were ineffective or had unwanted side effects.  In the case of anticholinergic medications, the side effects often include dry eyes, dry mouth, constipation, cognitive changes and blurred vision.
 
Allergan, Inc. began to commercialize Botulinum toxin A (Botox®) for OAB treatments in calendar 2013, and this treatment is a direct competitor for our Urgent PC System following unsuccessful drug therapy.  In this procedure, Botox is injected into the bladder wall, often with approximately twenty individual injection sites, to numb and mask the symptoms of urgency and frequency.  We believe that marketing campaigns by Allergan, Inc. will increase awareness of OAB. However, we also believe that the side effects of Botox injections for this application, which can include urinary retention and urinary tract infection, will lead many patients to choose our less invasive solution.
 
Medtronic’s InterStim® neuromodulation device, which stimulates the sacral nerve, requires surgical implantation of a lead near the patient’s spine in addition to a battery powered stimulator in the buttocks.  In contrast, our Urgent PC System allows minimally invasive stimulation of the sacral nerve plexus via a small needle electrode in the ankle in an office-based setting without any surgical intervention.  Medtronic formally launched a competing PTNS technology in 2016.  In order to obtain 501(k) approval, a device must provide proof of substantial equivalence.  In the case of the NUROTM device from Medtronic, the Urgent PC stimulator from Cogentix Medical was the predicate device.  Other companies may also enter the U.S. market with neuromodulation or other products for the treatment of OAB.
 
Macroplastique
 
Injectable urethral bulking agents for stress urinary incontinence competing directly with Macroplastique in the United States include: Durasphere® manufactured by Carbon Medical Technologies, Inc. and distributed by Coloplast Corp; and Coaptite® manufactured by Merz Aesthetics, Inc. and distributed by Boston Scientific Corporation.  We believe Macroplastique competes effectively against these products because it will not degrade, resorb or migrate, has no special preparation or storage requirements, and is safe and effective for treating adult female stress urinary incontinence.
 
 12
 

Outside of the United States, Deflux® (manufactured by Q-Med AB, a wholly owned subsidiary of Galderma S.A., and distributed by Salix Pharmaceuticals, Ltd.) and Bulkamid® (manufactured by Contura, Inc., Denmark and distributed by SEP Pharma) compete with Macroplastique for vesicoureteral reflux and SUI, respectively.
 
Government Regulation
 
The testing, manufacturing, promotion, marketing and distribution of our medical products in the United States, Canada, Europe and other parts of the world are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, including the FDA, the European Union and other analogous agencies.  Unlike our medical products, the manufacturing of our Machida industrial scopes is not subject to direct government regulation.
United States
 
Our products are regulated in the United States as medical devices by the FDA under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDC Act”).  Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in, among other things:

· | fines, injunctions, and civil penalties;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | recall or seizure of products;
--+-------------------------------


· | operating restrictions, or total or partial suspension of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | denial of requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | withdrawal of existing approvals; and
--+--------------------------------------


· | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------



Depending on the degree of risk posed by the medical device and the extent of controls needed to ensure safety and effectiveness, there are two pathways for FDA marketing clearance of medical devices.  For devices deemed by FDA to pose relatively less risk (Class I or Class II devices), manufacturers, in most instances, must submit a pre-market notification requesting permission for commercial distribution, known as 510(k) clearance.  Devices deemed by FDA to pose the greatest risk (Class III devices), such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or a device deemed not to be substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, require the submission of a pre-market approval (PMA) application.  The FDA can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of devices at the time of their clearance or approval, or subsequent to marketing.
 
Our PrimeSight flexible endoscopes and accessory products have been classified by the FDA as Class II devices and EndoSheath Protective Barrier products have been classified by the FDA as Class II sterile devices.  We have received FDA clearance for all of our endoscopes and accessory products that require clearance with the exception of the bronchoscope 2.8mm EndoSheath model, for which we are currently seeking FDA clearance.  We expect that we will be required to file 510(k) Pre-market Notifications for each additional endoscope that we develop in the future.
 
In October 2005, our initial version of the Urgent PC System received 510(k) clearance for sale within the United States. In July 2006, our second generation Urgent PC System received 510(k) clearance for sale within the United States.
 
In October 2006, we received FDA pre-market approval for the use of Macroplastique to treat female stress urinary incontinence in the United States.  As part of the FDA-approval process, we are conducting a customary post-market study.
 
 13
 

After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply.  These include:
 
 
· | Quality System Regulations, which require manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | labeling regulations, which govern product labels and labeling, prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and promotional activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if such malfunction were to recur; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | notices of correction or removal, and recall regulations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------



The FDC Act requires that medical devices be manufactured in accordance with FDA’s current Quality System Regulations, which require, among other things, that we:
 
 
· | regulate our design and manufacturing processes and control them by the use of written procedures;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | investigate any deficiencies in our manufacturing process or in the products we produce;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | keep detailed records and maintain a corrective and preventative action plan; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | allow the FDA to inspect our manufacturing facilities on a periodic basis to monitor our compliance with Quality System Regulations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

European Union, Canada and Other Regions
 
The European Union has adopted rules that require that medical products receive the right to affix the CE mark, which stands for Conformité Européene.  The CE mark demonstrates adherence to quality standards and compliance with relevant European medical device directives.  Products that bear the CE mark can be imported to, sold or distributed within the European Union.
 
We have received CE certification from Underwriters Laboratories UK for conformity with the European Union Medical Devices Directive allowing us to CE mark our endoscopes and accessory product lines currently sold in Europe.
 
Our initial version of the Urgent PC System received CE marking in November 2005.  Our second generation Urgent PC System received CE mark approval and approval from the Canadian Therapeutic Products Directorate of Health in June 2006.
 
We received the CE mark approval for Macroplastique in 1996 for the treatment of male and female stress urinary incontinence and vesicoureteral reflux; for VOX in 2000 for vocal cord rehabilitation and; for PTQ in 2002 for the treatment of fecal incontinence.
 
In 2016, we experienced an unexpected delay in the renewal of our CE Mark for certain of our products during the third quarter.  Due to this delay, we were forced to find a new notified body on short notice in order to renew our CE certificates when AMTAC/Intertek could not fulfill its obligations to us. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we obtained renewal of the CE Mark for Macroplastique and Urgent PC and have resumed importing, selling and distributing our products in the European Union under Dekra, a notified body licensed in The Netherlands.
 
Under the Canadian Medical Devices Regulations, all medical devices are classified into four classes, Class I being the lowest risk class and Class IV being the highest risk.  Class I devices include among others, devices that make only non-invasive contact with the patient.  Classes II, III and IV include devices of increasingly higher risk as determined by such factors as degree of invasiveness and the potential consequences to the patient if the device fails or malfunctions. Our current endoscopes and accessory products sold in Canada generally fall into Classes I and II.  All Class II, III and IV medical devices must have a valid Medical Device License issued by the Therapeutic Products Directorate of Health Canada before they may be sold in Canada (Class I non-sterile devices require only an establishment license, which we have obtained and maintain on an annual basis).  We have obtained applicable Medical Device Licenses in Canada for all of our currently marketed endoscopes and accessory products.

Quality Standards
 
In August 2005, the quality system certification at our facility in Natick, Massachusetts was updated to establish conformance with International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 13485: 2003 and continued conformance with Medical Devices Directive (“MDD”) 93/42/EEC and the Canadian Medical Device Regulations (“CMDR”).  In September 2015, we completed a facility transfer from Natick, Massachusetts to Westborough, Massachusetts.  All regulatory and quality standards have been met, allowing ongoing operations for domestic and international distribution.
 
In April 2007, our facility in Orangeburg, New York successfully completed an expansion audit and we were awarded ISO 13485 certification for this location.  This certification allowed us to start shipping scopes from our facility in Orangeburg, New York, in addition to shipments from our facility in Natick, Massachusetts.  The Westborough and Orangeburg facilities are registered with the FDA as medical device manufacturers.  As a result, these facilities are subject to the FDA’s Quality System Regulations, which regulate the design, manufacturing, testing, quality control, and documentation procedures. We are also required to comply with the FDA’s labeling requirements, as well as its information reporting regulations.
 
Our manufacturing facility in Minnetonka, Minnesota and our manufacturing processes at that facility have been inspected and certified in compliance with ISO 13485, applicable European medical device directives and Canadian Medical Device Requirements.
 
The export of medical devices is also subject to regulation in certain instances.  Our compliance with these various regulatory requirements is monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA and audits by independent authorities to maintain our ISO 13485, Canadian Medical Device Requirements and European medical device directives status.  We routinely update our systems to comply with changes to applicable regulations such as the recent changes to the European medical device directives, as amended by 2007/47/EC.
 
In addition to the three-year ISO certification audits, we undergo annual surveillance audits to confirm that we are properly maintaining our quality system.  This quality system has been developed in accordance with the ISO to ensure that companies are aware of the standards of quality to which their products will be held worldwide.
 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
We seek to establish and protect our proprietary technology using a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and nondisclosure and non-competition agreements.  We file patent applications for patentable technologies we consider important to the development of our business based on an analysis of the cost of obtaining a patent, the likely scope of protection, and the relative benefits of patent protection compared to trade secret protection, among other considerations.
 
As of March, 2017, we hold 26 U.S. patents, and we have three U.S. patent applications pending. In addition, we have 110 foreign patents granted and have six foreign patent applications pending.  The issued and granted patents will expire on various dates in the years 2017 through 2031.  These patents relate to electro-nerve stimulation; soft-tissue bulking materials, processes and applications; disposable sheaths for endoscopes; endoscopic designs and features; and reusable flexible endoscopes, as well as other various products, endoscopy and non-endoscopy related.
 
While we believe that our patents adequately protect our technologies, there can be no assurance that any of our issued patents are of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection and that any of our pending patent applications will result in patents being issued to us.  In addition, there can be no assurance that any of our current or future patents will not be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented by others, or that our patents will provide us with any competitive advantage.  Any legal proceedings to maintain, defend or enforce our patent rights could be lengthy and costly, with no guarantee of success.  Third parties could also hold patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and there can be no assurance that the required licenses would be available to us on reasonable terms, or if at all.
 
 15
 

We also seek to protect our trade secrets by requiring employees, consultants, and other parties to sign confidentiality agreements and noncompetition agreements, and by limiting access by outside parties to our confidential information.  There can be no assurance that these measures will prevent any unauthorized disclosure or use of our confidential information or that others will not be able to independently develop such information.
 
 In the U.S. and throughout the European Union, we have registered “Cogentix Medical” as our Company name, and Uroplasty® for Uroplasty LLC, one of our subsidiaries.  We have registered “Urgent” for our neuromodulation product, “Macroplastique” for our urological tissue bulking products, “VOX” for our otolaryngology tissue bulking products, and “PTQ” for our colorectal tissue bulking products.  We own the U.S.-registered trademarks PrimeSightTM, Vision Sciences®, EndoSheath®, Slide-On®, EndoWipe® and The Vision System®.
 
Research and Development
 
We have research and development projects and activities to develop, enhance and evaluate potential new products for which we incur costs for regulatory submissions, regulatory compliance and clinical research.  Our expenditures for clinical research include studies for new applications or indications for existing products, post-approval regulatory compliance and marketing and reimbursement approval by third-party payers.  Our expenditures for research and development totaled approximately $4.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and $3.2 million for the Transition Period ended December 31, 2015.
 
With respect to our industrial segment, our ability to custom-design for specific applications is common practice in our business.  On-wing inspections with blending borescopes have become an indispensable tool for aircraft engine manufacturers and service providers.  We work closely with Pratt & Whitney, GE and other engine manufacturers, developing and producing the most efficient borescopes for their specific applications. We are developing a new processor with a video recording capability.  Also, we are currently testing inexpensive C-MOS camera chips for industrial inspection applications.
 
Product Liability
 
The medical device industry is subject to substantial litigation.  The nature of our products exposes us to significant product liability risks.  We currently carry a worldwide product liability insurance policy that covers up to $10 million in liability.  We believe that such coverage amount is appropriate, given our business, products, past sales levels and our anticipated sales levels. However, we cannot assure that our existing insurance coverage limits are adequate to protect us from liabilities we might incur.  Product liability insurance is expensive to obtain and maintain, and may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all.  We evaluate the adequacy of our coverage periodically to determine if adjustments should be made.  Furthermore, we do not expect to be able to obtain insurance covering our costs and losses as a result of any product recall.  A successful claim in excess of our insurance coverage could materially deplete our assets.  Moreover, any claim against us could generate negative publicity, which could decrease the demand for our products and our ability to generate revenues.
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
 Our operations are regulated under various federal, state, and local laws governing the environment, including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the clean-up of contaminated sites.  We have infrastructure in place to ensure that our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations.  Our compliance with applicable environmental requirements for calendar year 2016 and the Transition Period has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Dependence on Major Customers
 
During calendar year 2016 and the Transition Period, none of our customers individually accounted for 10% or more of our net sales.
 
Backlog
 
We did not have significant backlog at the end of calendar year 2016 or the Transition Period.
 
 16
 

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 177 employees, of which 173 were full-time and four were part time.  No employee was subject to a collective bargaining agreement.  We believe we maintain good relations with our employees.
