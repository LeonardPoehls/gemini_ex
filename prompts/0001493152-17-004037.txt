ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Players Network was incorporated in the State of Nevada in March of 1993. Players Network is a vertically integrated company that is engaged in the development of digital networks, and is also actively pursuing the cultivation and processing of medical marijuana in North Las Vegas pursuant to two medical marijuana establishments (MME) licenses we were granted by the city of North Las Vegas for cultivation and production. The Company holds an 84.4% interest in Green Leaf Farms Holdings, LLC, which is a holding company formed to house our medical marijuana and recreational marijuana businesses. We distribute broadband video and other social media content over a wide variety of internet enabled devices and cable television channels. The Company has launched its proprietary scalable NexGenTV technology platform. The platform is designed to deliver video content and develop digital social communities, including “Weed TV” on the media side of the business.
Media Platform
 
NexGenTV, our scalable Digital Technology Platform, allows Players Network to distribute content for brands, businesses and celebrities, and provide them with an unlimited amount of lifestyle category content and the tools to launch their own “Branded Channel, Social Community and Marketplace Destination”. NexGenTV’s scalability can create hundreds of niche digital networks that can be viewed worldwide on any smart TV, computer, tablet or mobile device by millions of people simultaneously. The Platform allows advertisers and marketing partners the ability to capture their target market through rich content such as professionally produced, branded television segments; user-generated videos; blogs; editorials; tweets; photos; special offers; events and custom-designed contests.
 
Our business model incorporates elements of traditional proven media features, such as advertising and transactional delivery methods, but also offers professional production, marketing and distribution services to build and monetize its branded channel destination, in which we expect to retain a continuous revenue stream with our partners. Channel partners have the option to manage their own Branded New Media Channel, or use our professional services team of television producers, writers, graphic designers and technologists to keep their channel updated, and their content fresh and relevant.
 
NexGenTV is the new proprietary enterprise platform which allows PNTV to provide brands, businesses, celebrities and professionals with the tools to launch their own network. NexGenTV’s scalability enables PNTV to create hundreds of niche channel destinations (networks) that can be viewed worldwide on any media device (smart TV, computer, tablet or mobile device).
 
Our business model is to generate revenues for our proprietary channels as well as from clients. Proprietary channels, such as WeedTV.com generate revenues through advertising, cross selling with other companies and premium membership subscriptions. Clients pay us to develop platforms to connect with their existing customers, as well as attract new ones. Weed TV is the Company’s first new channel offering that will operate on the new platform and provide its audience the ability to connect to industry insiders and businesses through unique, high-quality marketing, content production and content management systems.
 
Weed TV launched on April 20, 2014, and was the Company’s third network to be launched. Weed TV is a Lifestyle Channel Destination powered by PNTV’s NexGenTV(SM) enterprise platform. Weed TV is a source of informational entertainment, products and services for people who relate to the marijuana lifestyle and social community. Weed TV content is available at www.weedtv.com
 
We plan for Weed TV to incorporate additional features and adapt new technology that the other networks don’t have, including a directory of businesses that cater to the marijuana business, such as dispensaries, smoke shops, doctors, financial institutions, manufactures and more. These businesses will have a free basic listing and the ability to upgrade for an extra fee of approximately $500 per month, where they can build their own media channel using the ‘NexGenTV” Platform. We estimate this market is in excess of approximately 70,000 businesses and will continue to grow as more states legalize MME businesses. Our goal in 2017 is to begin to capture this market in an effort to increase our revenues.
 
We plan to use both Weed TV’s platform and original branded programming and events as a means to develop additional revenue streams, in addition to providing marketing and membership benefits of our social media platform. These revenue streams would be generated by branded entertainment, sponsorships for events, media placement, third party commissions for video and banner advertisements, merchandise and production sales and services.
 
Our enterprise platform is highly scalable and can efficiently deploy, manage and distribute videos with integrated revenue-generating tools that go beyond traditional advertising. On our platform, the viewer of a video is brought into a web environment encompassing the lifestyle represented within the video content where they may be presented with membership, merchandising, couponing, subscription, loyalty programs, contest and other marketing opportunities, including the integration of live events. The platform also integrates branded sponsorships and a game-like virtual economy supported by our Cost Per Action (“CPA”) advertising network.

Our next-generation media network operates across all distribution platforms from TV screens to mobile devices, gaming consoles, computers and tablets. We have positioned ourselves to provide companies an affordable, turnkey, integrated solution. We have not yet generated revenues from our Platform, but plan to market our services to companies in 2017.
 
Through the cross-promotional integration of sponsored live events, contests and media creation and distribution, our platform can deliver a targeted audience that can be monetized in multiple ways. The platform is an engine that can grow as audience and page views increase. The platform also provides a self-perpetuating aggregation juncture where businesses can connect socially with their audience/customer.
 
The ability to monetize video in so many ways, coupled with an efficient, easy-to-use technical and administrative back-end dashboard is a powerful feature of our platform. It allows the creation of unlimited, new channel destinations using our scalable content management system (“CMS”) framework, with cost-competitive operations. Importantly, it enables administrative and editorial level employees to manage content without the expense of having a full-time technical engineering staff in-house.
 
Premium members must be industry insiders and/or experts in their lifestyle category. For example, with regard to the cannabis business, insiders are leaders in the movement, business owners, advocates, etc. who offer our members deals on transactions connected to their sphere of influence. Deals may include being invited to a special VIP event, line passes, two-for-one offers, pay-per-view video discounts offered within the businesses’ products and services, etc.
 
Green Leaf Farms Holdings Overview
 
Green Leaf Farms Holdings, LLC (“GLFH”, “Green Leaf”) was selected and granted two Medical Marijuana Establishments (MME) licenses by the State of Nevada; one for cultivation, and one for production of extracts.
 
The Cannabis Industry is one of the fastest growing markets in the America, and Nevada is uniquely positioned to become one of, if not the largest market in the country. It is projected that by the end of 2017 there will be 43,000 Nevada State issued medical marijuana cardholders. Of equal importance, is the fact that Nevada law offers reciprocity to Out-of-State medical cannabis cardholders. With nearly one million medical marijuana cardholders residing in states adjacent to Nevada, and more than 52 million annual visitors to Nevada, the market for medical marijuana is substantial, and with the recent passage of recreational marijuana laws that are expected to be implemented in the summer of 2017, Nevada is expected to generate $1.8 billion in revenue from cannabis in 2018. As large as the medical marijuana market is, it is dwarfed by the potential adult recreational marijuana market.
 
Products & Services
 
Green Leaf expects to provide the following products and services:
 

● | Premium organic medical cannabis sold wholesale to licensed retailers 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | If legalized, recreational marijuana cannabis products sold wholesale to distributors and retailers 
● | Extraction products such as oils and waxes (as distinguished from cultivation grow house atmospheres) derived from in-house cannabis production 
● | Value-added products (e.g., salves, tinctures, oils) processed from in-house cannabis production 
● | Edibles produced in an on-site commercial kitchen from in-house cannabis production 
● | Processing and extraction services for licensed medical cannabis cultivators in Nevada 
● | High quality cannabis genetics in the form of vegetative cuttings for sale to licensed medical cannabis cultivators in Nevada 
● | Support for international Cannabis medical research, genetic development, labeling, and legalization 

Future Outlook
 
Green Leaf plans to focus on developing high quality products and to employ a strong branding strategy to sell its custom cannabis strains. The quality and consistency of our branded products would help build consumer loyalty. The growing facility, with modular construction would allow us to scale efficiency from both a cost and operational standpoint. 
Market Opportunity for Media Platform
 
The Company believes it has an opportunity to capitalize on its early adoption of its technology and digital platforms. The digital revolution has rapidly changed the way consumers access television content. Instead of scheduled programming, video can now be viewed “On Demand” through digital cable television and satellite networks, broadband internet, and by downloading content to mobile and wireless devices such as smart phones and tablets.

Each new network is expected to become an integrated channel destination that will include VOD television and a social community to complete and complement a vertical distribution and marketing strategy. Each network will command a new audience and advertisement tied to the amount of monthly viewers, thus ultimately increasing Players Network’s advertising revenues.
 
Social media websites have continued to explode during the past few years, however many people have not heard of the hundreds of upcoming niche social networks. We plan to integrate all our websites with social elements in order to create communities and increase memberships. Increased membership would lead to increased web traffic and commerce opportunities that target the seventy billion dollar US gaming industry.
 
Distribution
 
We distribute our gaming lifestyle media programming through a variety of media platforms including, VOD, broadband/internet, satellite television, cable television, packaged media, and on our proprietary website. Through our dedicated channels of taped original television series, live pay per view events, mobile and internet content downloading, information segments and interactive content, the channel’s expanded programming will include popular poker programs, reality shows, game shows, documentaries, talk shows and special events surrounding the gaming lifestyle.
 
Broadband/Internet/ Mobile
 
Broadband/internet and mobile is the future, as consumers are tired of paying high cable and satellite bills and younger generations are spending the majority of their time on internet and mobile devices, millions of consumer are cutting their cable and satellite services and accessing their content through less expensive, new media devices connected to the internet.
 
Currently there are over 7 billion interconnected devices that served up 535 billion videos in 2017 and are expected to grow to 14 billion devices by the end of 2018. This shift in consumer habits is breaking down the barriers of entry in the content business and allowing producers and publishers to distribute directly to its targeted audiences through key word searches.
 
The Company is continuously seeking advertiser and sponsorship support with some premium content available to consumers for a fee. As brand awareness grows through advertising and major industry tie-ins, the Company will seek to become an aggregating portal for other gaming sites.
 
We intend to heavily market and cross-promote our website and are actively exploring additional relationships through social media networks. We also believe there is a great opportunity to provide content to, and share content with providers of other gaming, entertainment, and educational websites. We intend to use our website to develop gaming lifestyle communities, then offer the members of these communities live video events, information services, discounts, travel, internet based commerce, etc., as well as instant messaging, chat, comments, reviews and perspectives from consumers on a variety of topical subjects.

Platform Strategy
 
Our goal is to leverage our enterprise platform to collaborate with industry experts and content producers in selected lifestyle and service fields in an effort to incubate digital business extensions with existing and new businesses by:

● | Continuing to look for partnerships to build new branded lifestyle categories. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
Although we are unaware of any other company that is aimed exclusively at the MMJ lifestyle market, we face intense competition from a variety of other companies that develop and distribute MMJ lifestyle content, including (i) online broadband MMJ related media companies, (ii) MMJ cultivation and production business in Nevada, (iii) broadband connectivity companies, and (iv) other telecommunications companies. In addition, our services compete for a viewer’s time and entertainment resources with other forms of entertainment. For Weed TV, there are other Internet based content channels however they have an entirely different business model and are not focused on being a branding and marketing services destination that supports MME businesses.
Intellectual Property
 
We have a library of over 1,350 gambling and gaming lifestyle videos and 120 marijuana and weed related videos. We own the intellectual property rights in the programming and content that we produce. Moreover, the slogans, “WeedTV.com”, “Everybody wants to be a player” and “The only game in town” are registered trademarks of the Company with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”). “Players Network” is also a registered trademark with the PTO.
Governmental Approval and Regulation
 
Players Network does not believe that any governmental approvals are required to sell its media products or services. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, governs the distribution of video programming by cable, satellite or over-the-air technology, through regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”). However, because Players Network’s video distribution systems do not use any public rights of way, they are not classified as cable systems and are subject to minimal regulation. Thus, the FCC does not directly regulate the programming provided by the Company.
 
Although the FCC generally does not directly regulate the services provided by Players Network, the regulation of video distribution and communications services is subject to the political process and has been in constant flux over the past decade. Further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements must be anticipated and there can be no assurance that Players Network’s business will not be adversely affected by future legislation or new regulations.

Research and Development
 
Players Network is constantly utilizing the latest technology to enhance our delivery platforms and the way we communicate with our customers. Although research and development costs are incorporated into our costs of operations on each project as it is developed, Players Network understands the importance of utilizing the latest available technology and constantly seeks to improve their delivery methods in today’s fast changing society. Part of the Company’s latest development efforts includes the implementation of social media marketing platforms to build communication and retention around our customers.
Seasonality
 
The amount of revenue realized by the Company each month is only affected slightly by the season for a variety of factors, that mainly include summer break, and holidays, when internet use increases.
Employees
 
We currently have one full-time employee: our chief executive officer, Mark Bradley, who is responsible for all material policy-making decisions and currently supports and operates our production and post-production operations. Management will hire additional employees on an as needed basis. None of our employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreement or labor union contract, nor has the Company been subjected to any strikes or employment disruptions in its history. We are using, and intend to continue to use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services when and as they are deemed necessary. We believe that the use of third-party service providers may enhance our ability to contain general and administrative expenses.
 
In addition to full-time employees, the Company has several outside consultants to cover needed support such as business affairs, programming and technology design and deployment supported by independent contractors on an as needed basis.
