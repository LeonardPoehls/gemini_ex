Item 1 - Business Overview 
Xenith Bankshares, Inc. is a Virginia corporation and bank holding company for Xenith Bank, a Virginia banking corporation and a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve"). Xenith Bank is a commercial bank specifically targeting the banking needs of middle market and small businesses, local real estate developers and investors, and retail banking clients (our "target customers"). Xenith Bank's regional area of operations spans from Baltimore, Maryland, to Raleigh and eastern North Carolina, complementing its significant presence in greater Washington, D.C., greater Richmond, Virginia, and greater Hampton Roads, Virginia (our "target markets"). Xenith Bank conducts its principal banking activities through 42 full-service branches and two loan production offices across these areas with its headquarters centrally located in Richmond, Virginia.
Unless the context requires otherwise or unless otherwise noted:

• | all references to "Xenith Bankshares," "we," "our," or "us" are to Xenith Bankshares, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Xenith Bank, collectively; and


• | all references to the "Bank" are to Xenith Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xenith Bankshares, Inc.

Our services and products consist primarily of taking deposits from, and making loans to, our target customers within our target markets. We provide a broad selection of commercial and retail banking products, including commercial and industrial, commercial and residential real estate and consumer loans, including marine finance floorplan and end-user products through Shore Premier Finance ("SPF"). We offer a wide range of checking, savings and treasury products, including remote deposit capture, automated clearing house transactions, debit cards, 24-hour ATM access, Internet and mobile banking, and bill pay service. We do not engage in any activities other than banking activities. 
Our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (our "common stock"), trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "XBKS." A significant portion of our outstanding common stock is owned by four institutional investors, which we refer to as our "institutional investors:" Anchorage Capital Group, L.L.C. ("Anchorage"), CapGen Capital Group VI L.P. ("CapGen"), The Carlyle Group. L.P. ("Carlyle") and BCP Fund I Virginia Holdings, LLC (collectively with BankCap Partners Fund I, L.P., BankCap Partners GP, L.P. and BankCap Equity Fund, LLC, "BankCap Partners"). Anchorage, CapGen, Carlyle and BankCap Partners owned 18.3%, 22.1%, 18.3% and 6.9%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2016.
Merger of Hampton Roads Bankshares, Inc. and Xenith Bankshares, Inc. 
Effective July 29, 2016,we completed our previously announced merger (the "Merger") with legacy Xenith Bankshares, Inc. ("Legacy Xenith"), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Merger Agreement"), dated February 10, 2016, by and between us and Legacy Xenith. At the effective time of the Merger, Legacy Xenith merged with and into us. Also at the effective time of the Merger, we changed our name from "Hampton Roads Bankshares, Inc." to "Xenith Bankshares, Inc." and changed our trading symbol to "XBKS."
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each holder of Legacy Xenith common stock, par value $1.00 per share, received 4.4 shares of our common stock for each share of Legacy Xenith common stock held immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. Each outstanding share of our common stock remained outstanding and was unaffected by the Merger.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and immediately following the completion of the Merger, legacy Xenith Bank, a Virginia banking corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Legacy Xenith ("Legacy Xenith Bank"), merged (the "Bank Merger") with and into the Bank, with the Bank surviving the Bank Merger. In connection with the Bank Merger, the Bank changed its name from "The Bank of Hampton Roads" to "Xenith Bank."    
Disposition of Mortgage Banking Business
Through Gateway Bank Mortgage, Inc. ("GBMI"), a wholly-owned operating subsidiary, the Bank provided mortgage banking services, including the origination and processing of mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. On September 16, 2016, we announced our decision to cease operations of our mortgage banking business. In connection with this decision, the Bank 
4

XENITH BANKSHARES, INC.

entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell certain assets of GBMI, and to transition GBMI's operations, which include originating, closing, funding and selling first lien residential mortgage loans, to an unrelated party, which was completed on October 17, 2016. In connection with the GBMI Sale, GBMI ceased taking new mortgage loan applications, and all applications with prospective borrowers that were in process as of the completion of the GBMI Sale were managed by GBMI through funding and sale to investors in the ordinary course of business. Management believes, after the discontinued operations have been fully transitioned to the purchaser and the remaining funded loans are sold, which was substantially complete as of December 31, 2016, there will be no material on-going obligations with respect to the mortgage banking business. 
Reverse Stock Split
On December 7, 2016, we announced a reverse stock split of outstanding shares of our common stock at a ratio of 1-for-10 (the "Reverse Stock Split"), which had been previously approved by our shareholders. The Reverse Stock Split became effective on December 13, 2016. No fractional shares were issued in the Reverse Stock Split, rather shareholders of fractional shares received a cash payment based on the closing price of our common stock as of the date of the Reverse Stock Split. The par value of each share of our common stock remained unchanged at $0.01 per share and the number of authorized shares was not affected. References made to outstanding shares or per share amounts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Form 10-K") have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split, unless otherwise noted.
Competition 
The financial services industry in our target markets remains highly competitive and is constantly evolving. We experience strong competition from other financial services organizations, some of which are not subject to the same degree of regulation that is imposed on us. Many of them have broader geographic markets and substantially greater resources and, therefore, can offer more diversified products and services. 
In our target markets, we compete with large national and regional financial institutions, savings banks and other independent community banks, as well as credit unions and consumer finance companies. Competition for deposits and loans is affected by factors such as interest rates and terms offered, the number and location of branches, types of products offered and reputation of the institution. 
We believe the most important factors that determine success are the quality and experience of bankers and their relationships with customers. Other factors include the quality of services and products offered, interest rates offered on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans, service charges and, in the case of loans to larger commercial borrowers, applicable lending capacity. However, there are banks with which we compete that have greater financial resources, access to capital and lending capacity, and offer a wider range of services than we do.
We believe another key competitive advantage lies in our ability to target, underwrite and manage commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans. While these skills may exist within large banks, they generally do not exist at community banks. Our management team and bankers have spent substantially all of their careers working with middle market and small business management teams on their business and strategic plans and providing financing to these businesses in a broad array of industries. Our bankers are skilled salespeople and consultants, with well-honed credit skills, that allow them to work with customers and prospects to determine how and under what conditions we can provide financing and other banking services to meet their needs.
Market 
The Bank's footprint is spread across the "Golden Crescent" and encompasses the Chesapeake Bay. The primary markets for the Bank are greater Richmond, Virginia, greater Hampton Roads, Virginia, and greater Washington, D.C. Additionally, the Bank conducts business across the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Virginia, in Baltimore, Maryland, and in Raleigh, North Carolina. These markets provide attractive opportunities for the Bank to grow its loan and deposit businesses in both retail and commercial capacities.
Greater Hampton Roads is the Bank's largest market by deposits and provides a stable deposit base coupled with attractive loan opportunities. In addition to our 22 offices in this area, the Bank's marine lending unit, SPF, operates here. Home to nearly 1.7 million people, the region is growing at a projected 5-year rate of 3.46% and enjoys a median household income of $61,560, 7.1% above the national average. A key attraction and driver of economic activity in this region is Naval Station Norfolk, which is accompanied by a wide array of supporting business in the private sector. The deposit market in this region grew an annual rate of 1.77% in the five years ending June 2016.

XENITH BANKSHARES, INC.

Greater Richmond, Virginia, is the Bank's second largest market by deposits and home to five of the Bank's offices, including its headquarters. In addition to being the Capital of Virginia, the region has a population of 1.3 million people and a projected 5-year growth rate of 4.57%. The median household income is $63,921, 11.2% above the national average. Richmond has eight Fortune 500 businesses and recently placed third on Inc. Magazine's List of 10 Best Places to Start a Business. The deposit market in this region grew an annual rate of 2.86% in the five years ending June 2016.
Greater Washington, D.C., is home to 6.2 million people and has a projected 5-year growth rate of 5.5%. The region's median household income is the second highest in the country at $93,461, 63% above the national average. This is a vibrant and diverse market built on supporting the US Government and its operations. The deposit market in this region grew an annual rate of 6.06% in the five years ending June 2016.
Products and Services 
We engage in a general community and commercial banking business, targeting the banking needs of individuals and small- to medium-sized businesses in our target markets. Our primary products are traditional loan and deposit banking services. 
We provide a high level of personalized service to our customers though our relationship managers and branch personnel. We believe that a banking relationship that includes multiple services, such as loan and deposit services, is the key to profitable and long-lasting customer relationships and that our local focus and local decision-making provides us with a competitive advantage over banks that do not have these attributes. 
Deposits and Treasury Management Services 
We offer a broad range of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposit accounts, including commercial and retail checking accounts, Negotiable Order of Withdrawal accounts, savings accounts and individual retirement accounts, as well as certificates of deposit with a range of maturity date options. The primary sources of deposits are small- and medium-sized businesses and individuals within our target markets. Additionally, we may obtain both national certificates of deposit and brokered certificates of deposit. All deposit accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") up to the maximum allowed by law of $250,000.  
Lending Products
We offer a range of commercial, real estate and consumer loans. Our loan portfolio is comprised of the following categories: commercial and industrial ("C&I"), construction, commercial real estate ("CRE"), residential real estate ("RRE") and consumer. C&I loans are loans to businesses that are typically for the financing of accounts receivable, inventory or equipment and machinery, which generally serves as collateral. We classify owner-occupied real estate loans as C&I, as the primary source of repayment is the cash flows from the business occupying the property. Construction loans are made to individuals and businesses for the purpose of construction of single-family residential properties, multi-family properties and commercial projects, as well as the development of residential neighborhoods and commercial office parks. CRE loans are made for the purchase and re-financing of income producing properties. Our RRE portfolio includes first and junior lien mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit and other term loans secured by first and junior lien mortgages. We make consumer loans, including financing for U.S. Coast Guard documented vessels to customers throughout the United States though SPF. 
Our primary lending objective is to meet business and consumer needs in our target markets, while maintaining our standards of profitability and credit quality. All lending decisions are based upon an evaluation of the financial strength and credit history of the borrower and the quality and value of the collateral securing the loan. Personal guarantees are required on a vast majority of our C&I and CRE loans. 
The direct lending activities in which we engage carry the risk that the borrowers will be unable to perform on their obligations. As such, interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and general economic conditions, nationally and in our primary market areas, have a significant impact on our results of operations. To the extent that economic conditions deteriorate, business and individual borrowers may be less able to meet their obligations to us in full and timely manner, resulting in decreased earnings or losses to us. To the extent we make fixed rate loans, general increases in interest rates will tend to reduce our income as the interest rates we must pay for deposits may increase while our interest income may be unchanged. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the value of property pledged as security for loans and the ability to liquidate that property to satisfy a loan if necessary. 
6

XENITH BANKSHARES, INC.

Our goal is to mitigate risks in the event of unforeseen threats to the loan portfolio as a result of economic downturn or other negative influences. Plans for mitigating inherent risks in managing loan assets generally include: consistently adhering to loan policies and procedures and modifying those policies on occasion to account for changing or emerging risks or changing market conditions, evaluating each borrower's business plan and financial condition during the underwriting process and periodically throughout the loan term, identifying and monitoring primary and alternative sources for loan repayment, and maintaining sufficient collateral to limit economic loss in the event of liquidation. Generally, policy requires that loan value not exceed a percentage of market value or fair value based upon appraisals or evaluations obtained in the ordinary course of our underwriting practices. Updated appraisals for real estate secured loans are obtained as necessary and appropriate to borrower financial condition, project status, loan terms, market conditions and federal regulations. The general terms and underwriting standards for each type of loan is incorporated into our loan policies. These policies are analyzed periodically by management and are reviewed and approved by our board of directors. Our loan policies and practices described in this Form 10-K are subject to periodic change, and each guideline or standard is subject to waiver or exception in the case of any particular loan, with appropriate approval and in accordance with our loan policies. 
An allowance for loan losses has been established that consists of general, specific and unallocated qualitative components. A risk rating system is employed to estimate loss exposure and provide a measuring system for setting general reserve allocations. The general component relates to groups of similar or homogeneous loans not designated for specific impairment analysis that are collectively evaluated for potential loss. The specific component relates to loans that are determined to be impaired and, therefore, individually evaluated for impairment largely based on the value of the loan's underlying collateral. An unallocated qualitative component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management's estimate of probable losses and considers internal portfolio management effectiveness and external macroeconomic factors. 
We are a traditional C&I lender providing loans for a variety of purposes, including cash flow, equipment and accounts receivable financing. This loan category represents 36.4% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 and is generally priced at a variable or adjustable rate. C&I loans must meet underwriting standards, including appropriate collateral and cash flow necessary to support debt service. 
CRE and construction loans represented 34.3% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. These loans are underwritten to mitigate lending risks typical of these types of loan such as declines in real estate values, changes in borrower cash flow and general economic conditions. We typically require a maximum loan-to-value ("LTV") of 80% or less and minimum cash flow debt service coverage at the time of origination of 1.20 to 1.0. Loans are secured primarily by duly recorded first deeds of trust. In some cases, we may accept a recorded second lien position. In general, borrowers will have a proven ability to build, lease, manage and/or sell a commercial or residential project and demonstrate satisfactory financial condition. We generally require an equity contribution toward the project. 
Construction loans are secured by real property where loan proceeds will be used to acquire land and to construct or improve real property for the creation of income producing or owner-occupied commercial properties. Borrowers are generally required to contribute equity into each project at levels according to loan policy. Construction loans require the financial condition and experience of the general contractor be satisfactory to us. Commercial land acquisition and construction loans generally are underwritten with a maximum term of 36 months. LTV ratios, with few exceptions, are maintained consistent with or below regulatory guidelines. Construction draw requests are generally presented in writing and certified by the contractor, the borrower and the borrower's architect. Prior to an advance, we or our contractors inspect the project to determine that the work has been completed in order to justify the draw requisition. Commercial permanent loans are secured by improved real property, which is generating income in the normal course of operation. Debt service coverage, assuming stabilized occupancy, must be satisfactory to support a permanent loan. At the time of origination, the debt service coverage ratio is generally at least 1.20 to 1.0. As part of the underwriting process, debt service coverage ratios are stress tested for adverse scenarios. 
RRE loans, including home equity lines and loans, made up 16.4% of the loan portfolio At December 31, 2016. These credits represent both first and second liens on residential property almost exclusively located in our target markets. The remaining 12.9% of our loan portfolio consists of consumer loans, including guaranteed student loans. At December 31, 2016, approximately 89% of the consumer loan portfolio was comprised of marine loans either originated or acquired by SPF. 
Additional Services 
We offer other banking related specialized products and services to our customers, such as travelers' checks, coin counters, wire services, online banking and safe deposit box services. Additionally, we offer our commercial customers various cash management products including remote deposit. Remote Deposit Capture allows our customers to make check deposits

XENITH BANKSHARES, INC.

conveniently from their office with a small desktop scanner for faster funds availability and to begin earning interest sooner. Our merchant services offers a suite of payment processing solutions tailored to retailers and other specific industries allowing processing of all major credit cards 24 hours a day 365 days a year. We issue letters of credit and standby letters of credit, most of which are related to construction loans, for some of our commercial customers. We also facilitate the use of back-to-back swaps to help us and our customers manage interest rate risk. We have not engaged in any securitizations of loans. We offer telephone, Internet and mobile banking to our customers. These services allow both commercial and retail customers to access detailed account information and execute a wide variety of banking transactions, including balance transfers and bill payment, by means other than a traditional teller or automated teller machine ("ATM"). We believe these services are particularly attractive to our customers, as these services enable them to conduct their banking business and monitor their accounts at any time. Telephone, Internet and mobile banking assist us in attracting and retaining customers and encourage our existing customers to consider us for all of their banking and financial needs. Throughout our target markets, we have a network of 43 ATMs accessible by the customers of the Bank. As we are a member of multiple ATM networks, our customers can also access ATMs not owned by the Bank worldwide. 
Supervision and Regulation 
General
We are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws. Set forth below is a summary of the significant laws and regulations applicable to us and the Bank. The description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are described. 
Regulatory Agencies
As a registered bank holding company, we are subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve and, acting under delegated authority, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended ("Bank Holding Company Act"). The Bank is a Virginia banking corporation and a member bank regulated by the Federal Reserve and the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the "Bureau of Financial Institutions"). The Bank operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary under Xenith Bankshares, a one bank holding company. Xenith Bankshares and the Bank are required by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Bureau of Financial Institutions, as applicable, to file quarterly financial reports on their respective financial condition and performance. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the Bureau of Financial Institutions conduct periodic on-site examinations of the Bank. We must comply with a variety of reporting requirements and banking regulations. The laws and regulations governing us generally have been promulgated to protect depositors, the deposit insurance funds, and the banking system as a whole, and are not intended to protect our shareholders and other creditors. Additionally, we must bear the cost of compliance with reporting and other regulations, and this cost is significant.
The Federal Reserve, Bureau of Financial Institutions and FDIC have the authority and responsibility to ensure that financial institutions are managed in a safe and sound manner and to prevent the continuation of unsafe and unsound practices. Additionally, they must generally approve significant business activities undertaken by financial institutions. Typical examples of such activities requiring approval include the establishment of branch locations, mergers and acquisitions, capital transactions and major organizational structure changes. Obtaining regulatory approval for these types of activities can be time consuming and expensive and ultimately may not be successful. These agencies regulate most aspects of the Bank's business, including required reserves against deposits, loans, investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowings, dividends and location and number of branch offices.
Insurance of Accounts and Regulatory Assessments
The Bank's deposit accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC (the "DIF"), up to the maximum legal limits of the FDIC, and are subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Bureau of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve. The current basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage is $250,000 per depositor. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act ("FDIA"), the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital.
The Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The FDIC utilizes a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon an institution's average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. The 
8

XENITH BANKSHARES, INC.

FDIC may increase assessments to maintain a strong funding position and reserve ratios of the DIF. For each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we reported $1.8 million in expense for FDIC insurance.
Capital Adequacy Guidelines
In July 2013, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC") approved a final rule (the "Basel III Rules") establishing a regulatory capital framework that implements in the United States the Basel Committee's Revised Framework to the International Convergence of Capital Management and Capital Standards regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the "Basel Committee") and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). The Basel III Rules implement higher minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks, include a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and establish criteria that financial instruments must meet to be considered common equity Tier 1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital, or Tier 2 capital. These enhancements are designed to both improve the quality and increase the quantity of capital required to be held by banking organizations, better equipping the U.S. banking system to cope with adverse economic conditions. Among the most important changes are stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments that would disallow the inclusion of instruments, such as trust preferred securities, in Tier 1 capital and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. In addition, the Basel III Rules require that most regulatory capital deductions be made from common equity Tier 1 capital.
Effective January 1, 2016, the minimum capital level requirements applicable to us and the Bank under the Basel III Rules, were: (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 5.125%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.625%; (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.625%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0% for all institutions. 
The Basel III Rules also establish a "capital conservation buffer" of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer, when added to the capital requirements, will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. The capital conservation buffer began to be phased in beginning January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution would be subject to limitations on certain activities including payment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers, if its capital level is below the buffered ratio.
The Federal Reserve may also set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. For example, holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. At this time, the bank regulatory agencies are more inclined to impose higher capital requirements to meet well-capitalized standards, and future regulatory change could impose higher capital standards as a routine matter.
The Basel III Rules also set forth certain changes in the methods of calculating certain risk-weighted assets, which in turn affect the calculation of risk-based ratios. Assets are adjusted under the risk-based guidelines to take into account different risk characteristics, with the categories ranging from 0% (requiring no risk-based capital) for assets such as cash and certain U.S. government and agency securities to 1,250% for certain high risk securities. For the bulk of assets that are typically held by a bank, including certain multi-family residential and CRE loans, C&I loans and consumer loans, the risk weighting falls between 50% and 150%. RRE first-lien mortgage loans on one- to four-family and certain seasoned multi-family RRE loans, which are not 90 days or more past due or nonperforming and which have been made in accordance with prudent underwriting standards, are assigned a 50% level in the risk-weighting system, as are certain privately issued mortgage-backed securities representing indirect ownership of such loans. Under the Basel III Rules, higher or more sensitive risk weights are assigned to various categories of assets, including certain credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credits that are 90 days past due or on nonaccrual, foreign exposures and certain corporate exposures. In addition, the Basel III Rules include greater recognition of collateral and guarantees, and revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo-style transactions. The Basel III Rules regarding changes to risk weightings were effective beginning January 1, 2015.
In addition, the Basel III Rules include certain exemptions to address concerns about the regulatory burden on community banks. For example, banking organizations with less than $15 billion in consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009 are permitted to include in Tier 1 capital trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued and included in Tier 1 capital prior to May 19, 2010 on a permanent basis, without any phase out. Community banks could also have made a one-time election in their March 31, 2015 quarterly filing to permanently opt-out of the requirement to include most accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") components in the calculation of a common equity Tier 1 capital and, in effect, retain the 
9

XENITH BANKSHARES, INC.

previous AOCI treatment, which is to exclude AOCI from capital. If a company did not make this election, unrealized gains and losses would be included in the calculation of its regulatory capital. The Bank made this one-time election to exclude AOCI. Overall, the Basel III Rules provide some important concessions for smaller, less complex financial institutions.
As of December 31, 2016, we met all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which we were subject, and were categorized as "well capitalized." Since December 31, 2016, there are no conditions or events that management believes have changed our status as "well capitalized." For additional information regarding our capital ratios, see Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption "Analysis of Financial Condition - Capital Resources."
Prompt Corrective Action
The Basel III Rules also revise the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions, including the Bank, if their capital levels do not meet certain thresholds. The prompt correction action rules now include a common equity Tier 1 capital component and increase certain other capital requirements for the various thresholds.
Under the revised prompt corrective action framework, a commercial bank is:

• | "well capitalized" if it has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% or greater, and is not subject to any written capital order or directive;


• | "adequately capitalized" if it has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% or greater, and does not meet the definition of "well-capitalized";


• | "undercapitalized" if it has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4%;


• | "significantly undercapitalized" if it has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3%; or


• | "critically undercapitalized" if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.

The risk-based capital standards of the Federal Reserve explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as an institution's ability to manage these risks, as important factors to be taken into account by the agency in assessing an institution's overall capital adequacy. The capital guidelines also provide that an institution's exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates be considered by the agency as a factor in evaluating a banking organization's capital adequacy.
The federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an institution fails to qualify as adequately capitalized. All institutions, regardless of their capital levels, are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying any management fees that would cause the institution to fail the requirements to qualify as adequately capitalized. An institution that is not at least adequately capitalized is: (1) subject to increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator; (2) required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan (including certain guarantees by any company controlling the institution) within 45 days; (3) subject to asset growth limits; and (4) required to obtain prior regulatory approval for acquisitions, branching and new lines of business. Additional restrictions and appointment of a receiver or conservator can apply, depending on the institution's capital level.
Any bank holding company that controls a subsidiary bank that has been required to submit a capital restoration plan will be required to provide assurances of compliance by the bank with the capital restoration plan, subject to limitations on the bank holding company's aggregate liability in connection with providing such required assurances. Failure to restore capital under a capital restoration plan can result in the bank being placed into receivership if it becomes critically undercapitalized. A bank subject to prompt corrective action also may affect its parent holding company, including possible restrictions or prohibitions on dividends or subordinated debt payments to the parent holding company by the bank, as well as limitations on other transactions between the bank and the parent holding company. In addition, the Federal Reserve may impose restrictions on the ability of the 
10

XENITH BANKSHARES, INC.

bank holding company itself to pay dividends, or require divestiture of holding company affiliates that pose a significant risk to the subsidiary bank, or require divestiture of the undercapitalized subsidiary bank.
Bank Holding Company Regulation
Under the Federal Reserve guidelines, every bank holding company must serve as a "source of strength" for each of its bank subsidiaries. The bank holding company is expected to commit resources to support a subsidiary bank, including at times when the holding company may not be in a financial position to provide such support. A bank holding company's failure to meet its source of strength obligations may constitute an unsafe and unsound practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve's regulations, or both. The source-of-strength doctrine most directly affects bank holding companies in situations where the bank holding company's subsidiary bank fails to maintain adequate capital levels. This doctrine was codified by the Dodd-Frank Act, but the Federal Reserve has not yet adopted regulations to implement this requirement.
In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") requires that an insured depository institution shall be liable for the loss incurred or anticipated by the FDIC arising from the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to any commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default.
The Bank Holding Company Act limits the investments and activities of bank holding companies. In general, a bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing, or controlling banks, providing services for its subsidiaries and various non-bank activities that are deemed to be closely related to banking. The activities of the company are subject to these legal and regulatory limitations under the Bank Holding Company Act and the implementing regulations of the Federal Reserve. Federal bank regulatory agencies have additional discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or non-bank subsidiary, if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution's financial condition.
Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in July 2010 and has resulted in a major overhaul of the financial institution regulatory system. A summary of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act is set forth below, along with information set forth in the applicable sections of this "Supervision and Regulation" section. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act established a new, independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") tasked with protecting American consumers from unfair, deceptive and abusive financial products and practices. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which focuses on identifying, monitoring and addressing systemic risks in the financial system. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, among other tasks, makes recommendations for increasingly strict rules for capital, leverage and other requirements as a company's size and complexity increase. The Dodd-Frank Act also includes provisions that, among other things, reorganize bank supervision and strengthen the Federal Reserve.
The Dodd-Frank Act also requires fees charged for debit card transactions to be both "reasonable and proportional" to the cost incurred by the card issuer. In June 2011, the Federal Reserve set the interchange rate cap at $0.24 per transaction. While these restrictions do not apply to banks with less than $10 billion in assets, the rule could affect the competitiveness of debit cards issued by smaller banks. 
Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the "Volcker Rule," prohibits any bank, bank holding company, or affiliate (referred to collectively as "banking entities") from engaging in two types of activities: "proprietary trading" and the ownership or sponsorship of private equity or hedge funds that are referred to as "covered funds." Proprietary trading, in general, is trading in securities on a short-term basis for a banking entity's own account. Funds subject to the ownership and sponsorship prohibition are those not required to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") because they have only accredited investors or no more than 100 investors. In December 2013, the federal banking agencies, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, finalized a regulation to implement the Volcker Rule. At December 31, 2016, we evaluated our securities portfolio and determined that we do not hold any covered funds.
Although the majority of the Dodd-Frank Act's rulemaking requirements have been met with finalized rules, approximately one-third of the rulemaking requirements are either still in the proposal stage or have not yet been proposed. Accordingly, it is difficult to anticipate the continued impact this expansive legislation will have on us and our prospects, our customers, our target markets and the financial industry in general.

Incentive Compensation Guidance
The federal banking agencies have issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of those organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The incentive compensation guidance sets expectations for banking organizations concerning their incentive compensation arrangements and related risk management, control and governance processes. The incentive compensation guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon three primary principles: (1) balanced risk-taking incentives, (2) compatibility with effective controls and risk management, and (3) strong corporate governance. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization's supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or take other actions. In addition, under the incentive compensation guidance, a banking organization's federal supervisor may initiate enforcement action if the organization's incentive compensation arrangements pose a risk to the safety and soundness of the organization. Further, a provision of the Basel III Rules on capital standards, described above, would limit discretionary bonus payments to bank executives if the institution's regulatory capital ratios fail to exceed certain thresholds. 
The Dodd-Frank Act also directs the federal banking agencies to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with assets in excess of $1 billion, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. In May 2016, the federal banking regulators, joined by the SEC, proposed such a rule that is tailored based on the asset size of the institution. All covered financial institutions would be subject to a prohibition on paying compensation, fees and benefits that are "unreasonable" or "disproportionate" to the value of the services performed by a person covered by the proposed rule (generally, senior executive officers and employees who are significant risk-takers). Moreover, the proposed rule includes a new requirement which provides that an incentive-based compensation arrangement must (1) include financial and non-financial measures of performance, (2) be designed to allow non-financial measures of performance to override financial measures of performance, when appropriate (so called safety and soundness factors), and (3) be subject to adjustment to reflect actual losses, inappropriate risk taking, compliance deficiencies, or other measures or aspects of financial and non-financial performance.
The scope and content of the federal banking agencies' policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
The CFPB was created under the Dodd-Frank Act to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection with broad rulemaking, supervision and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that would apply to all banks and thrifts, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act ("TILA"), Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ("RESPA"), Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the "GLB Act") and certain other statutes. Banking institutions with total assets of $10 billion or less, such as the Bank, remain subject to the supervision and enforcement of their primary federal banking regulator with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws and such additional regulations as may be adopted by the CFPB.
The CFPB has promulgated rules relating to remittance transfers under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which require companies to provide consumers with certain disclosures before the consumer pays for a remittance transfer. The CFPB has also amended certain rules under the Federal Reserve's Regulation C relating to home mortgage disclosure, to reflect a change in the asset size exemption threshold for depository institutions based on the annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. In addition, the CFPB promulgated its "Ability-to-Repay/Qualified Mortgage" rules, which amended the TILA's implementing regulation, Regulation Z ("Regulation Z"). Regulation Z currently prohibits a creditor from making a higher priced mortgage loan without regard to the consumer's ability to repay the loan. The rule implements sections 1411 and 1412 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which generally requires creditors to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer's ability to repay any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling (excluding an open-end credit plan, timeshare plan, reverse mortgage or temporary loan) and establishes certain protections from liability under this requirement for "qualified mortgages." The rule also implemented section 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which limits prepayment penalties. Finally, the rule requires creditors to retain evidence of compliance with the rule for three years after a covered loan is consummated. The rule became effective January 10, 2014. The CFPB allowed for a small creditor exemption for banks with assets under $2 billion and that originated less than 500 mortgage loans in 2015. As of January 1, 2016, the small creditor exemption was extended to banks with assets under $2 billion and that originate less than 2,000 mortgage loans.

XENITH BANKSHARES, INC.

On November 20, 2013, pursuant to section 1032(f) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued the Know Before You Owe TILA/RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule ("TRID"), which combined the disclosures required under TILA and sections 4 and 5 of RESPA, into a single, integrated disclosure for mortgage loan transactions covered by those laws. TRID, which requires the use of a "Loan Estimate" that must be delivered or placed in the mail no later than the third business day after receiving the consumer's application and a "Closing Disclosure" that must be provided to the consumer at least three business days prior to consummation, became effective for applications received on or after October 3, 2015 for applicable closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property. Creditors must only use the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure forms for mortgage loan transactions subject to TRID. All other mortgage loan transactions continue to use the "Good Faith Estimate" and the "Initial Truth-in-Lending Disclosure" at application and the "HUD-1 Settlement Statement" and the "Final Truth-in-Lending Disclosure" at closing. TRID also has new tolerance requirements and record retention requirements. Of note, the creditor must retain evidence of compliance with the Loan Estimate requirements, including providing the Loan Estimate, and the Closing Disclosure requirements for three years after the later of the date of consummation, the date disclosures are required to be made, or the date the action is required to be taken. Additionally, the creditor must retain copies of the Closing Disclosure, including all documents related to the Closing Disclosure, for five years after consummation.
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999
The GLB Act implemented major changes to the statutory framework for providing banking and other financial services in the United States. The GLB Act, among other things, eliminated many of the restrictions on affiliations among banks and securities firms, insurance firms and other financial service providers. A bank holding company that qualifies as a financial holding company is permitted to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incident or complimentary to financial activities. The activities that the GLB Act expressly lists as financial in nature include insurance activities, providing financial and investment advisory services, underwriting services and limited merchant banking activities.
To be eligible for these expanded activities, a bank holding company must qualify as a financial holding company. To qualify as a financial holding company, each insured depository institution controlled by the bank holding company must be well-capitalized and well-managed and have at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (See "Community Reinvestment Act" below). In addition, the bank holding company must file with the Federal Reserve a declaration of its intention to become a financial holding company. The Dodd-Frank Act amended this provision to require that financial holding companies also be well capitalized and well managed.
The GLB Act has not, and we do not expect that the GLB Act will in the future, materially affect our products, services or other business activities, nor do we believe that the GLB Act will have a material adverse impact on our operations. To the extent that it allows banks, securities firms and insurance firms to affiliate, the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and greater competition.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 comprehensively revised the laws affecting corporate governance, accounting obligations and corporate reporting for companies with equity or debt securities registered under the Exchange Act, as amended. In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 established (1) requirements for audit committees, including independence, expertise and responsibilities; (2) certification responsibilities for the chief executive officer and chief financial officer with respect to financial statements; (3) standards for auditors and regulation of audits; (4) increased disclosure and reporting obligations for reporting companies and their directors and executive officers; and (5) increased civil and criminal penalties for violations of the federal securities laws.
Payment of Cash Dividends
We are a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. We do not conduct stand-alone operations; therefore, our ability to pay dividends depends on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us. There are various legal limitations applicable to the payment of dividends by the Bank to us and to the payment of dividends by us to our shareholders, including requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums. We are incorporated under the Virginia Stock Corporation Act, which has restrictions prohibiting the payment of dividends if, after giving effect to the dividend payment, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business, or if our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be required if we were to be dissolved to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of any preferred shareholders.
Consistent with its policy that bank holding companies should serve as a source of financial strength for their subsidiary banks, the Federal Reserve has stated that, as a matter of prudence, a bank holding company generally should not maintain a rate of 
13

XENITH BANKSHARES, INC.

distributions to shareholders unless its net income has been sufficient to fully fund the distributions, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the bank holding company's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Further, the Federal Reserve issued Supervisory Letter SR 09-4, which provides guidance on the declaration and payment of dividends, capital redemptions and capital repurchases by bank holding companies. Supervisory Letter SR 09-4 provides that, as a general matter, a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce its dividends if: (1) the bank holding company's net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (2) the bank holding company's prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company's capital needs, asset quality and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (3) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Failure to do so could result in a supervisory finding that the bank holding company is operating in an unsafe and unsound manner.
Banking regulators have indicated that Virginia banking organizations should generally pay dividends only (1) from net undivided profits of the bank, after providing for all expenses, losses, interest, and taxes accrued or due by the bank, and (2) if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Under the current supervisory practices of the Federal Reserve, prior approval from the Federal Reserve and a supermajority of the Bank's shareholders is required if cash dividends declared in any given year exceed net income for that year plus retained earnings of the two preceding years. In addition, under the FDIA, insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, are prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if after making such distribution, the institution would become "undercapitalized" (as such term is used in the statute).
Under Virginia law, no dividend may be declared or paid out of a bank's paid-in capital. Xenith Bank may be prohibited under Virginia law from the payment of dividends if the Bureau of Financial Institutions determines that a limitation of dividends is in the public interest and is necessary to ensure our financial soundness, and the Bureau of Financial Institutions may also permit the payment of dividends not otherwise allowed by Virginia law. The terms of the Subordinated Notes also impose limits on our ability to pay dividends on shares of our common stock.
Loans to Insiders
The Federal Reserve Act and related regulations (such as Regulation O) impose specific restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders of banks. Under Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, any loan to a director, executive officer or principal shareholder of a bank, or to entities controlled by any of the foregoing, may not exceed, together with all outstanding loans to such persons or entities controlled by such person, the bank's loan to one borrower limit. Loans in the aggregate to insiders and their related interests as a class may not exceed two times the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus until the bank's total deposits equal or exceed $100 million, at which time the aggregate is limited to the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act also prohibits loans above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders of a bank or bank holding company, and to entities controlled by such persons, unless such loans are approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank with any "interested" director not participating in the voting. Our policy on loans to insiders establishes a maximum amount, which includes all other outstanding loans to such persons, as to which prior board of director's approval is required, of the greater of $25,000 or 5% of capital and surplus (up to $500,000). Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders be made in terms and underwriting standards substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded coverage of transactions with insiders by including credit exposure arising from derivative transactions. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits an insured depository institution from purchasing or selling an asset to a director, executive officer or principal shareholder (or any related interest of such a person) unless the transaction is on market terms and, if the transaction exceeds 10% of the institution's capital it is approved in advance by a majority of the disinterested directors.
Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates
The Bank is subject to the provisions of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act with respect to affiliates, including Xenith Bankshares. These provisions place limits on the amount of:

• | loans or extensions of credit to affiliates;


• | investment in affiliates;


• | assets that the Bank may purchase from affiliates, except for real and personal property exempted by the Federal Reserve; 

14

XENITH BANKSHARES, INC.


• | the amount of loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates; and


• | the Bank's guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate.

The total amount of the above transactions are limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of capital and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, each of the above transactions must also meet specified collateral requirements. The Bank must also comply with other provisions designed to avoid the taking of low-quality assets from an affiliate.
The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the scope of Section 23A to include investment funds managed by an institution as an affiliate, as well as other procedural and substantive hurdles.
The Bank also is subject to the provisions of Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, prohibits banks from engaging in any transaction with an affiliate unless the transaction is on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies.
Certain Acquisitions
The Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (1) acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of any bank or other bank holding company, (2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company, or (3) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company.
Additionally, the Bank Holding Company Act provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any of these transactions if it would result in or tend to create a monopoly or substantially lessen competition or otherwise function as a restraint of trade, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve's consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy. As a result of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the "Patriot Act"), which is discussed below, the Federal Reserve is required to consider the record of a bank holding company and its subsidiary banks in combating money laundering activities in its evaluation of bank holding company merger or acquisition transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act also amended the Bank Holding Company Act to require consideration of the extent to which a proposed acquisition, merger or consolidation would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system.
Under the Bank Holding Company Act, if well capitalized and well managed, any bank holding company located in Virginia may purchase a bank located outside of Virginia. Conversely, a well capitalized and well-managed bank holding company located outside of Virginia may purchase a bank located inside Virginia. In each case, however, restrictions currently exist on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in specified concentrations of deposits.
Change in Bank Control
Subject to various exceptions, the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring "control" of a bank holding company. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if a person or company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company. A rebuttable presumption of control arises if a person or entity acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities of a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, such as Xenith Bankshares, or such ownership interest is greater than the ownership interest held by any other person or group.
Sound Banking Practices
Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsound banking practices. For example, the Federal Reserve's Regulation Y requires a bank holding company to give the Federal Reserve prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the bank holding company's consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. As another example, a holding company could not impair its subsidiary bank's soundness by causing it to make funds available to non-banking subsidiaries or their customers if the Federal Reserve believed it not prudent to do so.
15

XENITH BANKSHARES, INC.

The Federal Reserve has the authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries that represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or that constitute violations of laws or regulations. The Federal Reserve can assess civil money penalties for activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. The penalties can be as high as $1,000,000 for each day the activity continues.
Standards for Safety and Soundness
The Federal Reserve has established safety and soundness standards applicable to banks regarding such matters as internal controls, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other benefits, asset quality and earnings. If a bank were to fail to meet these standards, the Federal Reserve could require it to submit a written compliance plan describing the steps it will take to correct the situation and the time within which such steps will be taken. The Federal Reserve has authority to issue orders to secure adherence to the safety and soundness standards.
Reserve Requirement
Under a regulation promulgated by the Federal Reserve, depository institutions, including the Bank, are required to maintain cash reserves against a stated percentage of their transaction accounts. Reserve requirements for calendar year 2016 are as follows:

• | for transaction accounts totaling $15.2 million or less, a reserve of 0%;


• | for transaction accounts in excess of $15.2 million up to and including $110.2 million, a reserve of 3%; and


• | for transaction accounts in excess of $110.2 million, a reserve requirement of 10%.

The dollar amounts and percentages reported here are all subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank had a reserve requirement of $63.9 million.
Privacy
Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information. Under the GLB Act, financial institutions may not disclose non-public personal information about a customer to unaffiliated third parties, unless the institution satisfies various disclosure requirements and the consumer has not elected to opt-out of the disclosure (with some exceptions). Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any non-affiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct-mail marketing or other marketing through electronic mail to consumers.
Monetary Policy
Banking is a business that depends on interest rate differentials. In general, the differences between the interest paid by a bank on its deposits and its other borrowings and the interest received by a bank on loans extended to its customers and securities held in its investment portfolio constitute a major portion of earnings. Thus, our earnings and growth will be subject to the influence of economic conditions generally, both domestic and foreign, and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money through various means including open market transactions in U.S. government securities. These transactions include the purchase and sale of securities to expand or contract the general liquidity in the financial system. Additionally, the Federal Reserve establishes a target Federal Funds Rate and Discount Rate. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve influence the general condition of interest rates in the marketplace, which could affect our profitability.
Depending on the Bank's asset-liability strategy, actions taken by the Federal Reserve may have a positive or negative effect on profitability. We cannot predict the actions of the Federal Reserve, nor can we guarantee that our asset-liability strategy is consistent with action taken by the Federal Reserve.
Community Reinvestment Act
The Community Reinvestment Act of 1997 and the regulations issued thereunder ("CRA") requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the record of financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers and acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. Federal regulators are required to provide and make public a written examination report of an institution's CRA performance. The Bank continues to maintain a satisfactory CRA rating.
16

Branch and Interstate Banking
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, national banks and state banks are able to establish branches in any state, if that state would permit the establishment of the branch by a state bank chartered in that state. Virginia law permits a state bank to establish a branch of the bank anywhere in the state; therefore, a bank with its headquarters outside the Commonwealth of Virginia may establish branches anywhere within Virginia. Such interstate bank mergers and branch acquisitions are also subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration limitations described in the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994.
Regulatory Enforcement Authority
Federal and state banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal and state banking regulators. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders, and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities.
Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations
The Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in CRE lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in CRE lending, if (1) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of total capital, or (2) total reported loans secured by multi-family and non-farm residential properties, and loans for construction, land development and other land represent 300% or more of total capital, and the bank's CRE loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices, including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and increasing capital requirements. On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a "Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending" reminding banks of the need to engage in risk management practices for CRE lending.
Allowance for Loan Losses
Federal bank regulatory agencies have released the Interagency Policy Statement on the allowance for loan losses to ensure consistency with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and more recent supervisory guidance, including, among other things, considerations for measuring impairment and estimating credit losses and illustrations of effective loss migration analysis. Additionally, the agencies issued 16 Frequently Asked Questions to assist institutions in complying with both GAAP and allowance for loan losses supervisory guidance. Highlights of the statement include the following:

• | the statement emphasizes that the allowance for loan losses represents one of the most significant estimates in an institution's financial statements and regulatory reports and that an assessment of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is critical to an institution's safety and soundness;


• | each institution has a responsibility to develop, maintain and document a comprehensive, systematic and consistently applied process for determining the amounts of the allowance for loan losses. An institution must maintain an allowance for loan losses that is sufficient to cover estimated credit losses on individual impaired loans as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the portfolio; and


• | the statement updated the previous guidance on the following issues regarding allowance for loan losses: (1) responsibilities of the board of directors, management and bank examiners; (2) factors to be considered in the estimation of allowance for loan and lease losses; and (3) objectives and elements of an effective loan review system.

Monitoring and Reporting Suspicious Activity
Under the Bank Secrecy Act (the "BSA"), financial institutions, including the Bank, are required to monitor and report unusual or suspicious account activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion or other criminal activities, as well as transactions involving the transfer or withdrawal of amounts in excess of prescribed limits. The BSA is sometimes referred to as an "anti-money laundering" law ("AML"). Several AML acts, including provisions in Title III of the Patriot Act, have been enacted to amend the BSA. The Patriot Act was enacted in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and is intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement agencies and the intelligence communities to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a 
17

XENITH BANKSHARES, INC.

variety of fronts. Under the Patriot Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence and "know your customer" standards in their dealings with financial institutions and foreign customers. On May 10, 2016, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued a final rule regarding customer due diligence that adds a requirement for covered financial institutions to understand the nature and purpose of customer relationships and identify the "beneficial owner" of legal entity customers. The formal implementation date is May 11, 2018. Finally, under the regulations of the Office of Foreign Asset Control ("OFAC"), banks are required to monitor and block transactions with certain "specially designated nationals" who OFAC has determined pose a risk to U.S. national security. 
Technology Risk Management and Consumer Privacy
State and federal banking regulators have issued various policy statements emphasizing the importance of technology risk management and supervision in evaluating the safety and soundness of depository institutions with respect to banks that contract with outside vendors to provide data processing and core banking functions. The use of technology related products, services, delivery channels and processes exposes a bank to various risks, particularly operational, privacy, security, strategic, reputation and compliance risk. Banks are generally expected to prudently manage technology related risks as part of their comprehensive risk management policies by identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling risks associated with the use of technology.
Under Section 501 of the GLB Act, federal banking agencies have established appropriate standards for financial institutions regarding the implementation of safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protection against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records, and protection against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information in a way that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to a customer. Among other matters, the rules require each bank to implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards relating to customer information.
Under the GLB Act, a financial institution must also provide its customers with a notice of privacy policies and practices. Section 502 prohibits a financial institution from disclosing non-public personal information about a customer to nonaffiliated third parties unless the institution satisfies various notice and opt-out requirements, and the customer has not elected to opt out of the disclosure. Under Section 504, the agencies are authorized to issue regulations as necessary to implement notice requirements and restrictions on a financial institution's ability to disclose non-public personal information about customers to nonaffiliated third parties. Under the final rule the regulators adopted, all banks must develop initial and annual privacy notices that describe in general terms the bank's information sharing practices. Banks that share non-public personal information about customers with nonaffiliated third parties must also provide customers with an opt-out notice and a reasonable period of time for the customer to opt out of any such disclosure (with certain exceptions). Limitations are placed on the extent to which a bank can disclose an account number or access code for credit card, deposit or transaction accounts to any nonaffiliated third party for use in marketing.
UDAP and UDAAP
Recently, banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address "unethical" or otherwise "bad" business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law. The law of choice for enforcement against such business practices has been Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (the "FTC Act"), which is the primary federal law that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices ("UDAP"), and unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce. "Unjustified consumer injury" is the principal focus of the FTC Act. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, there was little formal guidance to provide insight to the parameters for compliance with UDAP laws and regulations. However, UDAP laws and regulations have been expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to "unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices" ("UDAAP"), which have been delegated to the CFPB for rule-making. The federal banking agencies have the authority to enforce such rules and regulations.
Other Regulation
The Bank is subject to a variety of other regulations. State and federal laws restrict interest rates on loans. The TILA and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act impose information requirements on banks in making loans. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits discrimination in lending on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors. The Fair Credit Reporting Act governs the use and release of information to credit reporting agencies. The Truth in Savings Act requires disclosure of yields and costs of deposits and deposit accounts. Other acts govern confidentiality of consumer financial records, automatic deposits and withdrawals, check settlement, endorsement and presentment, and reporting of cash transactions as required by the Internal Revenue Service.

Employees 
At December 31, 2016, we had 490 employees, including 468 full-time employees. All of our employees were employed by the Bank. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit, and we believe that relations with our employees are good.
