History
 
The Company is currently in the business of acquiring companies and technologies engaged in the development, production, sales and marketing of CBD related products and processes
 
On May 22, 2016 the Company completed the acquisition of Greenlife Botanix ("Greenlife") as detailed in the First Amendment to the Shareholder Agreement dated February 8, 2016. The Company issued 10,000,000 restricted shares of its common stock to the shareholders of Greenlife in exchange for their 100% interest in Greenlife. The shares were valued at the market value on the date of issuance, $0.23, for a total consideration of $2,300,000. The amount paid for Greenlife was recorded as Goodwill due to the start up nature of Greenlife and the minimal net assets of Greenlife at the time of acquisition. Subsequent to the purchase of Greenlife the Company executed a rescission agreement with Freedom Seed and Feed, "FSF", which prevented Greenlife from becoming a fully integrated cosmetic company. Due to the rescission of FSF and the remarketing of the Greenlife product line the Company evaluated the book value of the asset and elected to impair the goodwill value of Greenlife and expensed the $2,300,000 book value in the year ended March 31, 2017. Greenlife started operations on September 18, 2014. In May 2017, the Company formed MYHI-AZ to acquire equipment to service the growing cannabis industry. In June 2017 the Company entered into a consulting agreement with D9 Manufacturing, "D9", to provide D9 customers with infrastructure equipment. Also in June 2017, MYHI-AZ purchased 2 intermodal grow containers from D9 to be used in a grow operation in Arizona. MYHI-AZ leased the grow containers to D9 for 3 years with the ability to extend the lease for an additional 2 years. The lease began August 15, 2017. The lease provides for a monthly lease rate of $20,000 a month and requires advance payment for operating supplies and expenses. The monthly lease rate is recorded as revenue and an Account Receivable while the advances are recorded as an Other Receivable. Both amounts are due when the crop is harvested. The containers were planted in October 2017 with an expected harvest in January 2018. The initial grow operation encountered a power failure which ultimately resulted in the loss of the crop. The loss of the crop has resulted in a deferral of collection of the lease rental payments and the operating cost payments. The power failure also highlighted additional issues with the containers and the facility where the containers are being used. The container issues and facility power requirement issue took a few months to resolve. However all issues have been corrected and a new crop is being planted in late June 2018 with an anticipated harvest in September 2018. Due to the Company's continued operations with D9 and potential future opportunities with D9, the Company believes the current and future receivable amounts will be collected in full. See Note 9, “Subsequent Events” to the Financial Statements for further information.
