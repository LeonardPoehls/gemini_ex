In this report, unless the context requires otherwise, references to the “Company”, “Novus Robotics”, “we”, “us” and “our” are to Novus Robotics Inc.
 
CORPORATE HISTORY
 
We were formed in the State of Nevada on June 24, 2005 under the name Guano Distributors, Inc. Prior to our incorporation, on April 15, 2005, David Wallace, the then President/Chief Executive Officer/Secretary/Chief Financial Officer and sole director (“Wallace”), formed Guano Distributors (Pty) Ltd., a South African registered company, for the purpose of selling Dry-Bar Cave bat guano. On May 15, 2005, Mr. Wallace, transferred all of his ownership interest in Guano Distributors (Pty) Ltd. to us. On June 28, 2006, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Ecoland International, Inc. On March 13, 2012, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State in order to change our name from “Ecoland International Inc.” to “Novus Robotics Inc.” (the “Name Change”). The Name Change was effective with the Nevada Secretary of State on March 13, 2012 when the Certificate of Amendment was filed. The Name Change was approved by our Board of Directors pursuant to written consent resolutions dated February 21, 2012 and further approved by certain shareholders holding a majority of our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock pursuant to written consent resolutions dated February 21, 2012. We filed the appropriate documentation with FINRA in order to effectuate the Name Change in the OTC Markets. The Name Change was effected on the OTC Markets April 10, 2012.
Reverse Stock Split
 
On October 26, 2015, the Board of Directors and our majority shareholders approved a reverse stock split of one for three hundred (1:300) of our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). Pursuant to our Bylaws and the Nevada Revised Statutes, a vote by the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding votes is required to effect the Reverse Stock Split. Our articles of incorporation do not authorize cumulative voting. As of the record date of October 26, 2015, we had 111,370,000 voting shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The consenting stockholders of the shares of common stock are entitled to 65,564,000 votes, which represented approximately 58.54% of the voting rights associated with our shares of common stock. The consenting stockholders voted in favor of the Reverse Stock Split described herein in a unanimous written consent dated October 26, 2015. See “Item 5. Market For Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Small Business Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities”.

The Board of Directors had previously considered factors regarding their approval of the Reverse Stock Split including, but not limited to: (i) the current volume of trading and trading price of our shares of common stock on the OTCQB Market and potential to increase the marketability and liquidity of our common stock based on structuring of potential business operations and acquisition; and (ii) limitation of marketability of our common stock among brokerage firms and institutional investors based upon current per-share price. Our Board of Directors approved the Reverse Stock Split and recommended the majority shareholders of the Company review and approve the Reverse Stock Split.
 
The Reverse Stock Split was effected on January 21, 2016 based upon the filing of appropriate documentation with FINRA. The Reverse Stock Split decreased the Company’s total issued and outstanding shares of common stock from approximately 111,370,000 shares to 371,233 shares of common stock. The common stock will continue to be $0.001 par value. The trading symbol of the Company will continue to be “NRBT”. Our new cusip number is 670011H207.
 
Share Exchange Agreement
 
Ecoland International, Inc., now known as Novus Robotics Inc., D&R Technology Inc., a private corporation (“D&R Technology”) and, Berardino Paolucci and Drakso Karanovic, the shareholders of D&R Technology Inc. (the “D&R Shareholders”) entered into that certain share exchange agreement dated January 27, 2012 (the “Share Exchange Agreement”). Our Board of Directors approved the execution and consummation of the transaction under the Share Exchange Agreement on February 1, 2012. In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Share Exchange Agreement, we issued an aggregate of 59,000,000 pre-Reverse Stock Split shares of our restricted common stock to the D&R Shareholders (which consisted of Messrs. Paolucci and Karanovic and D Mecatronics, which is holding the shares for the benefit of the remaining shareholders of D&R Technology) in exchange for 100% of the total issued and outstanding shares of D&R Technology, thus making D&R Technology its wholly-owned subsidiary. Our Board of Directors deemed it in the best interests of our shareholders to enter into the Share Exchange Agreement pursuant to which it would acquire all the technology and assets and assume all liabilities of D&R Technology. This resulted in a change in control and our overall business operations thus bringing potential value to our shareholders. D&R Technology was previously the wholly-owned subsidiary of D Mecatronics Inc., a Delaware corporation. On approximately November 10, 2011, D Mecatronics spun-off D&R Technology. D&R Technology subsequently issued shares of its restricted common stock to the shareholders of D Mecatronics on a pro-rata basis in accordance with their respective equity holdings in D Mecatronics. The equity percentages regarding the issuance of shares by D&R Technology were 48% to Berardino Paolucci, 24% to Drasko Karanovic and 28% to various shareholders (which shares were previously held by D Mecatronics on behalf of these shareholders).
 
Escrow Agreement. On June 4, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the execution of that certain escrow agreement dated June 4, 2013 (the “Escrow Agreement”) with Manhattan Transfer Registrar Co., our transfer agent (“Manhattan Transfer”). As disclosed in previous filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on approximately November 10, 2011, D Mecatronics Inc. (“D Mecatronics”) spun-off our wholly-owned subsidiary, D&R Technology. D&R Technology subsequently issued shares of its restricted common stock to the shareholders of D Mecatronics on a pro-rata basis in accordance with their respective equity holdings in D Mecatronics. The equity percentages regarding the issuance of shares by D&R Technology were 48% to Berardino Paolucci, 24% to Drasko Karanovic and 28% to various shareholders (which shares were being held by D Mecatronics on behalf of these shareholders). The transfer agent for D Mecatronics at the time of the spin-off was Global Sentry Equity Transfer Inc. (“Global Sentry”). At the time of the spin-off, management of D Mecatronics had attempted on several occasions to contact Global Sentry with regards to its shareholder list and records. However, any and all attempts were to no avail. To date, D Mecatronics has not been able to obtain any of its records, including a shareholders list, from Global Sentry. Management has no knowledge or information as to the whereabouts of Global Sentry or its management nor of the location of its records and shareholders list. This has impeded the issuance of the shares of D&R Technology to the appropriate 28% minority shareholders of D Mecatronics and thus the reason why D Mecatronics was holding the shares in trust for the benefit of its shareholders.

Subsequently, we entered into the Share Exchange Agreement. Our Board of Directors had approved the execution and consummation of the transaction under the Share Exchange Agreement on February 1, 2012. In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Share Exchange Agreement, we issued an aggregate of 59,000,000 pre-Reverse Stock Split shares of our restricted common stock to the D&R Shareholders (which consisted of Messrs. Paolucci and Karanovic and D Mecatronics, which held the shares for the benefit of the remaining shareholders of D&R Technology) in exchange for 100% of the total issued and outstanding shares of D&R Technology, thus making D&R Technology our wholly-owned subsidiary. The Board of Directors deemed it in the best interests of the shareholders to enter into the Share Exchange Agreement pursuant to which it would acquire all the technology and assets and assume all liabilities of D&R Technology.
 
The majority shareholders of D&R Technology approved the Share Exchange Agreement as did its Board of Directors. The Board of Directors of D&R Technology resolved in its board resolutions to issue to D Mecatronics the 16,520,000 pre-Reverse Stock Split shares to be issued to the missing 28% minority shareholders of D&R Technology (who are also the unknown shareholders of D Mecatronics). Therefore, D Mecatronics held in trust and for the benefit of its unknown shareholders (and as shareholders of D&R Technology) the shares to be issued to them by the Company. D Mecatronics is in the process of attempting to locate the transfer agent in order to obtain its records.
 
We are also in the process of locating the missing shareholders of D Mecatronics (and also as shareholders of D&R Technology) to whom our shares should be issued in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Share Exchange Agreement. Therefore, we entered into the Escrow Agreement. In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement, D Mecatronics returned to Manhattan Transfer the share certificate evidencing the shares of our common stock issued to it as trustee. A new share certificate was issued to Manhattan Transfer as trustee in the aggregate denomination of 16,520,000 shares to be held in escrow. Together with Manhattan Transfer, we created a shareholders list (the “Shareholders List”) indicating each record owner of the shares. Subsequent to the date of the Escrow Agreement, Manhattan Transfer has released shares to certain of the persons indicated on the Shareholders List. As of the date of this Annual Report, Manhattan Transfer has issued approximately 5,331,641 of the 16,520,000 pre-Reverse Stock Split shares held in escrow to the shareholders listed on the Shareholder List.
 
We have placed on our website www.novusrobotics.com (which is currently under construction) under “Investor Relations” contact information to be used by persons/entities that believe they were shareholders of D Mecatronics. Such individuals/entities should contact our management.

In further accordance with the terms and provisions of the Technology Purchase Agreement, we issued to each of Messrs. Paolucci and Karanovic 500,000 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock and 24,500,000 post-Reverse Stock Split shares of restricted common stock. See “Item 5. See “Item 5. Market For Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Small Business Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” and “Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters”.
 
The Sellers each represented and confirmed that Berardino Paolucci is the Chief Executive Officer/President and a member of the Board of Directors and Drasko Karanovic is a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, that both Berardino Paolucci and Drasko Karanovic acknowledged and confirmed their fiduciary duties as such, and that Berardino Paolucci and Drasko Karanovic and we have negotiated in good faith with the best interests of our shareholders in consideration of the transaction.
 
Industry
 
The automotive parts industry is divided into three tiers of original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), which supply automotive manufacturers with parts for new vehicles, and the aftermarket parts suppliers, which manufacture parts for used vehicles.
 
The automobile industry is one of the largest sectors of the global economy. In 2011, a market research firm valued the global automobile components sector at over $1.8 trillion dollars and the global automotive parts and equipment sector at almost $600,000,000. The global automotive manufacturing industry operates in an increasingly aggressive marketplace whose performance is tied directly to performance of the large and growing retail automobile industry. The top six companies in the global manufacturing industry are General Motors (GM), Toyota, Ford, Daimler/Chrysler, Volkswagen and Honda and, of those, the Corporation’s subsidiary, D&R Technology, has produced machines supplying parts and components for five of the top six manufacturers. The systems that we build for our customers are for Tier 1 OEM suppliers. An OEM supplier is an “original equipment manufacturer or, in other words, a company that manufactures products or components that are purchased by a company and retailed under that purchasing company’s brand name. OEM refers to the company that originally manufactured the product. When referring to automotive parts, OEM designates a replacement part made by the manufacturer of the original part. In this usage, OEM means “original equipment from manufacturer” The Tier I OEM suppliers deal directly with the automakers - General Motors, Ford, Nissan, Honda, Toyota, Hyundai etc. We supply the systems to the Tier 1 OEM suppliers that produce the seats, front dashboards and other products for the big automakers.
 
The automotive industry marketplace is the nation’s largest manufacturing industry. It is a marketplace with an estimated value in the hundreds of billions. The nation’s automotive manufacturing industry is tied to the U.S. automotive industry, which is considered one of the largest automotive retail marketplaces in the world. Management reviews marketplace press releases which state that economies are growing steadily from last year and that over the next five years, older automobiles will need to be replaced. India and China are cited as requiring more products for their growing population. Thus, based on such research, it is management’s best belief that this demand will require more systems by the Tier 1 OEMs.
 
Products
 
We provide special purpose machinery products and services to Automotive Tier I businesses and their suppliers. Our services include design and installation of retrofits to existing systems, spare parts, maintenance, repairs and production support. We build seat frame systems and tube processing lines. Each system consists of self contained tooling modules linked by a series of automated transfer or robots. Several modules will be integrated into a processing system by adding single or multi-axis transfer units. This approach allows uniformity of design, which provides ease of expansion, simplicity of operation, and excellent throughput rates.

At conception of the project, we review component designs and provide suggestions to our customers to reduce manufacturing costs. We work with customers to ensure that proposed systems strike the right balance of throughput, flexibility, automation and tooling/capital budgets. Throughout the project, our team managers work to keep the customer’s team informed with progress updates, highlighting decision points and tracking component design changes. Our designs and technologist work to ensure that our production solutions are robust, reliable and maintainable. We collaborate with our technology partners to ensure that every aspect is leading edge and proven reliable. Ultimately, we work with our customers to ensure that our production solutions provide value to every level of their organization.
 
Our value propositions regarding our machinery products and services are: (i) delivery – providing on-time delivery thereby reducing customer inventory and providing them with overall cost reduction; (ii) quality – products and services that we deliver are of high quality and have attributes that enable customers to carry out their business functions; and (iii) price – products are competitively priced thus helping customers control their own overhead and expenses. We work with our customers on a one-to-one basis to the best of its ability to keep our prices competitive and within the customers’ budgets. When our customers desire to bid on jobs, they contact and provide us with certain prerequisites. We then discuss their respective needs and start to compile all relevant information into a request for quote file. We then review all compiled information and submit to the customer its quotation regarding pricing. We have a very broad and diverse field that we have developed from which to obtain certain pricing. We would not receive purchase orders to provide our services to our respective customers if our prices were not competitive in the marketplace. Therefore, we believe we offer very competitive pricing based upon prior successful demand and awards for our products and services.
 
Our primary focus will be placed on product engineering and manufacturing processes to ensure the highest quality, high level of product features, and the most efficient manufacturing process possible. We will focus our market offerings on two major customer groups: (i) automobile seating manufacturers; and (ii) manufacturers of tubing products. Our products are listed below:
 
Seat Frame System is comprised of the following of which all components thereof are designed and manufactured by the Corporation:
 

● | Unbundler, Weld seam station with Roland Seamfinder, CNC bending stations with barcode readers, 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Transfers, Reject Station, Vertical 4- post press module with tooling change options 
● | Material Handling Robots, Exit racks and Safety Fences. 
● | IP Tube System: Instrument Panel Tube machine makes the bent tube form that holds your steering wheel, gauges etc. All of these components are held on a tube form. 
● | IP Beam System: Instrument Panel Beam process line: the machine that produces the beams – which are made from larger diameter tubes for the front and car doors 
● | Integrated Bend-Weld System is a system that will transfer the formed tube to a welding station to be welded to the bottom of the seat frame. 

 
The automated tube bending machines that we build require spare parts that will replace the used and worn out components on various parts of the machines. We design and manufacture the machinery and replace them as required. We will provide all maintenance and repair to the machines as the wear and tear of running them over long periods of time becomes evident.
 
Services and Support
 
Our customer centric focus enables its customers to preserve and increase the value of existing processing equipment. We provide the following programs and services:

Maintenance and Repairs Programs: warranty support, after sales and emergency services, preventative maintenance programs, and spare parts and consumables solutions.
 
Value Added Services: system upgrades and rebuilds, control system upgrades, tooling retrofits, pre-production and prototyping requirements, training, equipment relocation and redeployment, systems audit, manufacturing consulting and project management services.
 
Marketing
 
Our target customers are: (i) automotive seating manufacturers, who are customers requiring customized machine tools to better serve their clients; and (ii) manufacturers of tubing products, who are customers requiring a value adding process layout. We will continue to focus our market offerings to automobile seating manufacturers and manufacturers of tubing products. We do not have any contractual agreements in place with its customers and utilizes purchase orders with its customers. Our market research reflects that these customer segments are the most demanding in terms of the engineering, technical service support, and automated machinery design. We are particularly strong in these areas and will utilize our capacities to serve these clients. We will seek customers who require production of components used in upper-end product lines. This will provide a further possibility for us to offer our value-added engineering robotics services.
 
In previous years, we have had significant economic and commercial reliance and dependence on Johnson Controls Inc. (“JCI”). JCI was one our major customers after the recession of 2009 through 2010 in which some of our previous customers filed for bankruptcy or acquired by larger companies. However, as of the date of this Annual Report, management has determined that we are not economically dependent upon JCI. During fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, D&R Technology received purchase orders from JCI in the amount of $260,873 and $350,182, respectively. During fiscal year 2016, approximately 30.3% sales were attributable to JCI. And, during fiscal year 2015, approximately 53% sales and 20% of our receivables were attributable to JCI.
 
We do not have an exclusive agreement with JCI and rely upon bids and subsequent purchase orders. Our business relationship with JCI is well established having commenced in 2004 with Bernardino Paolucci, our President/Chief Executive Officer, and Drasko Karanovic, a member of the Board of Directors. Both individuals established a strong relationship with JCI during their tenure at Dieco Technology based upon their respective extensive knowledge of JCI’s machines and the manufacturing and servicing section of JCI.
 
We also produced a 420A system to produce new seat frames. The system is built for Toyota Boshoku Emire, Ontario, to produce the seat frame to be used in their plants for the Rav 4 production. During fiscal year 2016, D&R Technology received from Toyota Boshoku purchase orders for $20,672. During fiscal year 2015, we received orders for $3,500 for spare parts. During fiscal years 2014 and 2013, we received purchase orders from Toyota Boshoku in the amounts of $146,101 and $2,500, respectively. Purchase orders from Toyota Boshoku have decreased because Toyota Boshoku has not produced any new systems requiring systems from us.
 
The material terms regarding the purchase orders are as follows: (i) progress payment terms consisting of 30% at award of purchase order, 30% at approximate eighty percent completion, 30% at acceptance, and 10% net thirty days’ (ii) completion time for designing and building system is generally 23 to 26 weeks; (iii) if spare parts required to construct system, delivery is 3 to 10 weeks from receipt of purchase order and terms for spare parts are net 45 days; and (iv) orders cancellable but in the event engineering and purchase orders for items with a long delivery time are placed with our suppliers, the customer is liable for any time, material and costs incurred.
 
Our market strategy is to capitalize on its expertise by manufacturing high quality, durable machinery with a significant number of product features and options, which are extremely precise in control of motions. We will focus on a segment of the market and attempt to achieve the best reputation within that segment. Our goal in the next year is to secure more engineering and manufacturing positions. Our goal in the next five years is to continue with our “value added” scheme that will assist us in achieving a strong position within the marketplace.

Suppliers
 
The majority of raw materials required by us are readily available from a variety of suppliers. For certain specialty items related to controls, the Corporation has two principal suppliers: (i) Allen Bradly Controls; and (ii) Baldor Controls.
 
The products we require for the assembly of its systems come from electrical companies, hydraulic and pneumatic suppliers and control system from automation companies. We do not have exclusive contracts with these companies as we disseminate Requests for Quotations on Pricing and Delivery time in order for us to maximize savings in the production process. Examples include: motors from Rockwell Ind., electrical components from Gerrie Electric/Province Electrical hydraulics power unit from Hydrafab. We machine remaining parts as required.
 
Employees
 
We employ sixteen full time employees. This may fluctuate depending on our workload. We may also use temporary employees that have previously worked for us as required depending on the workload. We have our President/Chief Executive Officer, Bernardino Paolucci, and a member of our Board of Directors, Drasko Karanovic, on a full-time basis. These individuals are primarily responsible for all of our day-to-day operations. Other services may be provided by outsourcing and consultant and special purpose contracts. We have also engaged the services of the wives of Messrs. Paolucci and Drasko as part-time employees, respectively, on a limited basis.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
 
We have incurred approximately $250,000 during the past two fiscal years on research and development for products. None of these research or development costs are borne by the customer. The costs are in our Cost of Sales and Engineering Labour accounts.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We currently use the Rockwell Automation system in our machines. We purchase on a yearly basis the automation portion of the system directly from Rockwell Automation, which is known as a “tool kit”. The tool kit enables us to receive updates, upgrades, technical assistance with the portion of the automation system that we use. We must use the supplier that the customer designates in their specifications when the customer orders the tube bending system from us. Each customer has their own preference regarding the supplier for this part of the machine. We do not have an exclusive requirements contract with Rockwell Automation. There are a substantial number of other companies in the marketplace that offer the automated portion of the control system.
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not filed patents on any of our systems. We do not release any drawings of our machines. The drawings are the property of D&R Technology. We may consider filing patent applications with respect to our system technologies and any novel aspects of our technology to protect our intellectual property. Future patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Thus, any patent that we may own may not provide adequate protection against competitors. Any patent applications that we may file in the future may not result in issued patents. Also, patents may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or advantages against competitors with similar or competing technologies. As a result of potential conflicts with the proprietary rights of others, we may in the future have to prove that it is not infringing the patent rights of others or be required to obtain a license to the patent.
 
We may consider filing a copyright application for the drawings of our machines. We will rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. However, it is possible that parties may breach those agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. It is also possible that its trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. There can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement or other claims against us with respect to any existing or future systems or products. Litigation to protect our proprietary information or to determine the validity of any third-party claims could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not we are successful in such litigation.
