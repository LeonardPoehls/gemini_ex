ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

EV Energy Partners, L.P. (“we,” “our,” “us” or the “Partnership”) is a publicly held Delaware limited partnership formed in 2006. Our general partner is EV Energy GP, L.P. (“EV Energy GP”), a Delaware limited partnership, and the general partner of our general partner is EV Management, LLC (“EV Management”), a Delaware limited liability company. EV Management is a wholly owned subsidiary of EnerVest, Ltd. (“EnerVest”), a Texas limited partnership. EnerVest and its affiliates have a significant interest in us through their 71.25% ownership of EV Energy GP which, in turn, owns a 2% general partner interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights (“IDRs”).
 
Our common units are traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “EVEP.” Our business activities are primarily conducted through wholly owned subsidiaries.
 
As of December 31, 2016, our oil and natural gas properties were located in the Barnett Shale, the San Juan Basin, the Appalachian Basin (which includes the Utica Shale), Michigan, Central Texas (which includes the Austin Chalk area), the Monroe Field in Northern Louisiana, the Mid–Continent areas in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Kansas and Louisiana and the Permian Basin.
 
Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserve information is derived from our reserve reports prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (“Cawley Gillespie”) and Wright & Company, Inc. (“Wright”), our independent reserve engineers. All of our proved reserves are located in the United States. The following table summarizes information about our proved reserves by geographic region as of December 31, 2016:

 _____________
 
(1) | At December 31, 2016, our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was $371.1 million. Because we are a limited partnership, we made no provision for federal income taxes in the calculation of standardized measure; however, we made a provision for future obligations under the Texas gross margin tax. The present value of future net pre–tax cash flows attributable to estimated net proved reserves, discounted at 10% per annum (“PV–10”), is a computation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows on a pre–tax basis. PV–10 is computed on the same basis as standardized measure but does not include a provision for federal income taxes or the Texas gross margin tax. PV–10 is considered a non–GAAP financial measure under the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). We believe PV–10 to be an important measure for evaluating the relative significance of our oil and natural gas properties. We further believe investors and creditors may utilize our PV–10 as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies. PV–10, however, is not a substitute for the standardized measure. Our PV–10 measure and the standardized measure do not purport to present the fair value of our reserves.

Current Developments
 
Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control. Historically, these prices have been volatile, and we expect them to remain volatile. In late 2014, prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids declined precipitously, and prices remained low through 2015 and most of 2016. While prices showed some improvement during the second half of 2016 and the beginning of 2017, they have continued to fluctuate.
 
Factors contributing to lower oil prices include real or perceived geopolitical risks in oil producing regions of the world, particularly the Middle East; lower forecasted levels of global economic growth combined with excess global supply; actions taken by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; and the strength of the U.S. dollar in international currency markets. Factors contributing to lower natural gas prices include increased supplies of natural gas due to greater exploration and development activities; higher levels of natural gas in storage; and competition from other energy sources. Prices for natural gas liquids generally correlate to the price of oil and, accordingly, prices remain lower than historical levels and are likely to continue to directionally follow the market for oil.
 
In 2016, these low prices negatively affected our revenues, earnings and cash flows, and continued volatility in prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Continued volatility or further declines in prices could also have a significant adverse impact on the value and quantities of our reserves, assuming no other changes in our development plans.
 
In 2016, in response to continued lower prices, we took a number of actions to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility, including:
 

· | repurchased $82.7 million of our outstanding senior notes due April 2019 for $35.0 million; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reduced the amount of capital spending we dedicated to the development of our reserves by approximately 75%; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | continued to reduce operating and capital costs; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | amended our credit facility to, among other things, ease the leverage covenants until 2018; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | continued to evaluate strategic divestitures such as our recent Barnett Shale divestiture described below and acquisitions of long-life, producing oil and natural gas properties; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reevaluated our common unit distribution policy and suspended our common unit distribution to conserve excess cash. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As a result of the steps above, as of December 31, 2016, we have over $205 million of liquidity between our borrowing base capacity, cash on hand and restricted cash. However, given current forward oil and natural gas prices and the fact that we have less production hedged at lower prices in 2017 relative to previous years, we have taken additional steps going forward into 2017 to continue to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility. These steps include:
 

· | focusing on managing and enhancing our base business through continued reductions in operating costs; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increasing our capital spending budget to $30 - $45 million from $10.7 million in 2016, in an effort to maintain current production levels; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | maintaining a sufficient liquidity position to manage through the current environment, which includes continuing to assess the appropriate distribution levels every quarter; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | continuing to evaluate strategic acquisitions of long–life, producing oil and natural gas properties such as our Eagle Ford Acquisition described below; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | further realizing the value of our undeveloped acreage through either alternative sources of capital, including farmouts, production payments and joint ventures, or potential monetization of acreage. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
During 2016, the board of directors of EV Management announced that it had elected to suspend distributions for the first three quarters of 2016. The board of directors also elected to suspend distributions for the fourth quarter of 2016. The company continues to generate positive distributable cash flow, albeit at significantly lower levels than previous years. The board of directors continues to evaluate the distribution on a quarterly basis and may elect to reinstate the distribution at the appropriate time when commodity prices and operating cash flows have increased to a level that can support a sustainable distribution in compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement. In order to reinstate distributions, we must be in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit agreement. We are currently in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the most recent ninth amendment of our credit agreement and expect to be in compliance through the end of 2017. Absent a rebound in commodity prices or an amendment to our credit facility, we currently project that we will not be in compliance with our leverage covenant at the end of the first quarter of 2018. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Covenants in our credit agreement may restrict our ability to resume and sustain distributions.
 
In December 2016, we sold a portion of our Barnett Shale natural gas properties for $52.1 million (before post-closing adjustments), which proceeds were deposited with a qualified intermediary to facilitate a like-kind exchange transaction pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. On January 31, 2017, we acquired a 5.8% working interest in 9,151 gross acres (529 net acres) in Karnes County, TX for $58.7 million (before post-closing purchase price adjustments) with the proceeds and $6.6 million of borrowings under our credit facility (the “Eagle Ford Acquisition”). Certain EnerVest institutional partnerships own an 87% working interest in, and EnerVest acts as operator of, the properties.
 
Long–Term Business Strategy

One of our primary business objectives is to manage our oil and natural gas properties for the purpose of generating sufficient excess cash flow that will allow us to reinstate a stable distribution, which we will be able to grow over time. To meet this objective, we intend to execute the following business strategies:

· | Maximize asset value and cash flow stability through our operating and technical expertise 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We seek to maintain an inventory of drilling and development projects to maintain and grow our production from our capital development program. EnerVest operates properties representing approximately 94% of our estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2016. Our development program is focused on lower–risk, repeatable drilling opportunities to maintain and grow cash flow.
 

· | Maintain focus on controlling the costs of our operations 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We focus on controlling the operating costs of our properties. We manage our operating costs by using advanced technologies and integrating the knowledge, expertise and experience of our management teams as well as the managerial and technical staff of EnerVest. Regarding our non–operated properties, we proactively engage with the operators to ensure disciplined and cost focused operations are being implemented.
 

· | Maintain conservative levels of indebtedness to reduce risk and facilitate acquisition opportunities 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Since our initial public offering in 2006, we have financed approximately 52% of our $2.3 billion of acquisitions with free cash flow and the issuance of common units in public and private offerings. We seek to maintain sufficient liquidity not only for our operating positions but also to maintain flexibility in financing our acquisitions.
 

· | Pursue alternatives to optimize the value of our assets 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We continue to pursue a range of alternatives to optimize the value of our assets, and we cannot at this time predict the type of transaction or transactions into which we may enter. We may not be successful in our efforts or it may take longer to complete a transaction than we expect.

-


· | Pursue acquisitions of long–lived producing oil and natural gas properties with relatively low decline rates, predictable production profiles, and low– risk development opportunities 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our acquisition program targets oil and natural gas properties that we believe will generate attractive risk-adjusted expected rates of return and that will be financially accretive. These acquisitions are characterized by long–lived production, relatively low decline rates and predictable production profiles, as well as low–risk development opportunities. As part of this strategy, we continually seek to optimize our asset portfolio, which may include the divestiture of noncore assets.
 
Our acquisition efforts may involve our participation in auction processes, as well as situations in which we are the only party or one of a very limited number of potential buyers in negotiations with the potential seller. We finance acquisitions with a combination of cash flow from operations, borrowings under our credit facility and funds from equity and debt offerings. We also acquire interests in properties alongside the institutional partnerships managed by EnerVest, which has allowed us to participate in much larger acquisitions than would otherwise be available to us, and directly from institutional partnerships managed by EnerVest.
 

· | Reduce cash flow volatility and exposure to commodity price and interest rate risk through commodity price and interest rate derivatives 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Changes in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices may cause our revenues and cash flows to be volatile. We enter into various derivative contracts intended to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. We currently maintain derivative contracts for a portion of our oil and natural gas production.
 
Our commodity derivatives are primarily in the form of swaps that are designed to provide a fixed price that we will receive. Without the use of these commodity derivatives, we would be exposed to the full range of price fluctuations. In addition, we enter into interest rate swaps to minimize the effects of fluctuations in interest rates.
 
Competitive Strengths

We believe that we are well positioned to achieve our primary business objectives and to execute our strategies because of the following competitive strengths:
 

· | Geographically diversified asset base characterized by long–life reserves and predictable decline rates 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our properties are located in eight producing basins with an average reserve life of 15.3 years as of December 31, 2016. The majority of our properties have been producing for many years, resulting in predictable decline rates.
 

· | Significant inventory of low–risk development opportunities 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have a significant inventory of development projects in our core areas of operation. At December 31, 2016, we had 3,014 identified gross drilling locations, of which approximately 144 were proved undeveloped drilling locations and the remainder were unproved drilling locations. In 2016, we drilled a total of 9 gross (2.6 net) development wells with a 100% gross success rate. Our development program is focused on lower risk drilling opportunities to maintain and increase production.
 

· | Relationship with EnerVest 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our relationship with EnerVest provides us with a wide breadth of operational, financial, technical, risk management and other expertise across a broad geographical range, which assists us in evaluating acquisition and development opportunities. In addition, we believe that our relationship with EnerVest allows us to participate in much larger acquisitions that would not otherwise be available to us.
 

· | Experienced management, operating and technical teams 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our executive officers and key employees have on average over 25 years of experience in the oil and natural gas industry and over ten years of experience acquiring and managing oil and natural gas properties for EnerVest partnerships.

Our Relationship with EnerVest

Our general partner is EV Energy GP, and its general partner is EV Management, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of EnerVest. Through our omnibus agreement, EnerVest agrees to make available its personnel to permit us to carry on our business. We therefore benefit from the technical expertise of EnerVest, which we believe would generally not otherwise be available to a company of our size.
 
EnerVest’s principal business is to act as general partner or manager of EnerVest partnerships, formed to acquire, explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas properties. A primary investment objective of the EnerVest partnerships is to make periodic cash distributions. EnerVest was formed in 1992 and is one of the 25 largest oil and natural gas companies in the United States, with more than 40,000 wells across 15 states, 6.5 million acres under lease and 5.4 Tcfe of proved reserves under management.
 
While our relationship with EnerVest is a significant attribute, it is also a source of potential conflicts. For example, we have acquired oil and natural gas properties from partnerships formed by EnerVest and partnerships in which EnerVest has an interest, and we may do so in the future. We have also acquired interests in oil and natural gas properties in conjunction with institutional partnerships managed by EnerVest. In these acquisitions, we and the institutional partnerships managed by EnerVest each acquire an interest in all of the properties subject to the acquisition. The purchase is allocated among us and the institutional partnerships managed by EnerVest based on the interest acquired. In the future, it is possible that we would vary the manner in which we jointly acquire oil and natural gas properties with the institutional partnerships managed by EnerVest.
 
EnerVest currently operates oil and natural gas properties representing 94% of our proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2016. The EnerVest partnerships own interests in oil and gas properties in which we own interests. The properties are primarily located in the Barnett Shale, Central Texas and the Appalachian Basin, and these properties represent approximately 65% of our net proved reserves at December 31, 2016. The investment strategy of the EnerVest partnerships is to typically divest their properties in three to five years, while our strategy contemplates holding such properties for a longer term. If the EnerVest partnerships were to sell their interests in these properties to an entity not affiliated with EnerVest, we may not have a sufficient working interest to cause EnerVest to remain operator of the property. The EnerVest partnerships are under no obligation to us with respect to their sale of the properties they own.
 
EnerVest is not restricted from competing with us. It may acquire, develop or dispose of oil and natural gas properties or other assets in the future without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or participate in the development of those assets. In addition, the principal business of the EnerVest partnerships is to acquire and develop oil and natural gas properties. The agreements for certain of our EnerVest partnerships, however, provide that if EnerVest becomes aware, other than in its capacity as an owner of our general partner, of acquisition opportunities that are suitable for purchase by the EnerVest partnerships during their investment periods, EnerVest must first offer those opportunities to those EnerVest partnerships, in which case we would be offered the opportunities only if the EnerVest partnerships chose not to pursue the acquisition. EnerVest’s obligation to offer acquisition opportunities to its existing EnerVest partnership will not apply to acquisition opportunities which we generate internally, and EnerVest has agreed with us that for so long as it controls our general partner it will not enter into any agreements which would limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities that we generate internally.

Our Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Data

Our Reserves
 
The following table presents our estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2016:
 

 | Oil (MMBbls) | | Natural Gas (Bcf) | | Natural Gas Liquids (MMBbls) | Bcfe
-----------------+--------------+------+-------------------+-------+------------------------------+-----
Proved reserves: | | | | | | | 
Developed | | 12.0 | | 523.1 | | 28.2 | 764.1
Undeveloped | | 0.6 | | 52.2 | | 5.2 | 87.1 
Total | | 12.6 | | 575.3 | | 33.4 | 851.2

 
Proved developed reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. See “Glossary of Oil and Natural Gas Terms.” All proved undeveloped locations conform to the SEC rules defining proved undeveloped locations. We do not have any reserves that would be classified as synthetic oil or synthetic natural gas.
 
Our estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible – from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations – prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimate. Reserves for proved developed producing wells were estimated using production performance and material balance methods. Certain new producing properties with little production history were forecast using a combination of production performance and analogy to offset production, both of which are believed to provide accurate forecasts. Non–producing reserve estimates for both developed and undeveloped properties were forecast using either volumetric and/or analogy methods. These methods are believed to provide accurate forecasts due to the mature nature of the properties targeted for development and an abundance of subsurface control data.
 
The data in the above table represents estimates only. Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserve engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that cannot be measured exactly. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Accordingly, reserve estimates may vary from the quantities of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that are ultimately recovered. Please read “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
 
Future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. Standardized measure is the present value of estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves, determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, without giving effect to non–property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses and debt service or to depreciation, depletion and amortization and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. Because we are a limited partnership which passes through our taxable income to our unitholders, we have made no provisions for federal income taxes in the calculation of standardized measure; however, we have made a provision for future obligations under the Texas gross margin tax. Standardized measure does not give effect to derivative transactions. The standardized measure shown should not be construed as the current market value of the reserves. The 10% discount factor, which is required by Financial Accounting Standards Board pronouncements, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate.
 
Our Proved Undeveloped Reserves
 
We annually review all PUDs to ensure an appropriate plan for development exists. As of December 31, 2016, none of our PUDs have remained part of our PUD inventory for more than five years following the date they were initially classified as PUDs, except for 3.5% of our PUDs that require sidetracks of existing producing wells, in which case the development will occur when existing production ceases. We plan to convert our PUDs as of December 31, 2016 to proved developed reserves within five years of the date they were included as part of our PUD inventory of drilling locations, except for the sidetracks mentioned above, by drilling 144 gross wells at a total estimated capital cost of $61.9 million.

At December 31, 2016, we had 87.1 Bcfe of PUDs compared with 187.7 Bcfe of PUDs at December 31, 2015. The following table describes the changes in our PUDs during 2016:
 

 | Bcfe | 
---------------------------------------+------+------
PUDs as of December 31, 2015 | | 187.7 | 
Revisions of previous estimates | | (94.8 | )
Sales of minerals in place | | (18.2 | )
Extensions and discoveries | | 13.7 | 
Converted to proved developed reserves | | (1.3 | )
PUDs as of December 31, 2016 | | 87.1 | 

 
The following describes the material changes to our PUDs during 2016:
 
Revisions of previous estimates. The annual review of our PUDs for 2016 resulted in a negative revision of 94.8 Bcfe. This change from prior estimates results from the decrease in prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids used in our December 31, 2016 reserve estimates from prices used in our December 31, 2015 reserve estimates.
 
Sales of minerals in place. In December 2016, we sold oil and natural gas properties in the Barnett Shale and Austin Chalk areas. Of the 18.2 Bcfe of PUDs sold in 2016, 17.2 Bcfe were located in the Barnett Shale and the remaining 1.0 Bcfe were located in the Austin Chalk.
 
Extensions and discoveries. As we drill wells on our leases, reserves attributable to wells adjacent to the newly drilled wells may be added as extensions and discoveries to the PUD category. Extensions and discoveries were primarily due to increases in PUDs associated with our successful drilling activity in 2016 in the Barnett Shale and Austin Chalk. PUD additions in the Barnett Shale and Austin Chalk totaled 13.0 Bcfe and 0.7 Bcfe, respectively. We plan to drill these new PUDs within five years of January 1, 2017.
 
Converted to proved developed reserves. In 2016, we developed approximately 1% of our PUD volume and 1% of our PUD locations booked as of December 31, 2015 through the drilling of 2 gross (0.6 net) development wells. Of these reserves and wells, 1.3 Bcfe and 1 gross well are located in the Barnett Shale and the additional well and reserves are located in the Mid-Continent area. Costs incurred relating to the development of PUDs were approximately $0.4 million during 2016.
 
Internal Controls Applicable to our Reserve Estimates
 
Our policies and procedures regarding internal controls over the recording of our reserves is structured to objectively and accurately estimate our reserves quantities and present values in compliance with both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the SEC’s regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations is the responsibility of Terry Wagstaff, our Vice President of Acquisitions and Engineering, who is also our principal engineer. Mr. Wagstaff has over 35 years of experience in the oil and natural gas industry, with exposure to reserves and reserve related valuations and issues during most of this time, and is a qualified reserves estimator (“QRE”), as defined by the standards of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Further professional qualifications include a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering, extensive internal and external reserve training, asset evaluation and management, and he is a registered professional engineer in the state of Texas. In addition, our principal engineer is an active participant in industry reserve seminars, professional industry groups, and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
 
Our controls over reserve estimates included retaining Cawley Gillespie and Wright as our independent petroleum engineers. We provided information about our oil and natural gas properties, including production profiles, prices and costs, to Cawley Gillespie and Wright, and they prepared their own estimates of 89% and 11%, respectively, of our reserves attributable to our properties. All of the information regarding reserves in this annual report on Form 10–K is derived from the reports of Cawley Gillespie and Wright, which are included as exhibits to this annual report on Form 10–K.
 
The principal engineer at Cawley Gillespie responsible for preparing our reserve estimates is W. Todd Brooker, a President and Principal with Cawley Gillespie. Mr. Brooker is a licensed professional engineer in the state of Texas (license #83462) with over 25 years of experience in petroleum engineering. The principal engineer at Wright responsible for preparing our reserve estimates is D. Randall Wright, the President of Wright. Mr. Wright is a licensed professional engineer in the state of Texas (license #43291) with over 43 years of experience in petroleum engineering.

Our Productive Wells

The following table sets forth information relating to the productive wells in which we owned a working interest as of December 31, 2016. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities. Gross wells are the total number of productive wells in which we have a working interest, regardless of our percentage interest. A net well is not a physical well, but is a concept that reflects the actual total working interest we hold in a given well. We compute the number of net wells we own by totaling the percentage interests we hold in all our gross wells. Operated wells are the wells operated by EnerVest in which we own an interest.
 
Our wells may produce both oil and natural gas. We classify a well as an oil well if the net equivalent production of oil was greater than natural gas for the well.

(1) | There are no spacing requirements on substantially all of the wells on our Monroe Field properties; therefore, one developed acre is assigned to each productive well for which there is no spacing unit assigned. 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Substantially all of our acreage is held by production, which means that as long as our wells on the acreage continue to produce, we will continue to hold the leases. The acreage in which we hold interests that are not held by production are not significant to our overall undeveloped acreage.
 
Title to Properties

As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. Prior to completing an acquisition of producing leases, we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and, depending on the materiality of the properties, we may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. As a result, we have obtained title opinions on a significant portion of our properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry. Our properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens for current taxes and other burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties.
Production by Field
 
The following table sets forth our production for 2016, 2015 and 2014 from the Barnett Shale, the Appalachian Basin and the San Juan Basin, which are the only fields during those years for which our estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2016 attributable to the field represented 15% or more of our total estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2016:

Our Drilling Activity

We intend to concentrate our drilling activity on low risk development drilling opportunities. The number and types of wells we drill will vary depending on the amount of funds we have available for drilling, the cost of each well, the size of the fractional working interests we acquire in each well, the estimated recoverable reserves attributable to each well and the accessibility to the well site.
 
The following table summarizes our approximate gross and net interest in development wells completed by us during 2016, 2015 and 2014, regardless of when drilling was initiated. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value.
 

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
-------------+-------------------------+----
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Gross wells: | | | | | | 
Productive | | 9.0 | | 62.0 | | 186.0
Dry | | - | | - | | 2.0 
Total | | 9.0 | | 62.0 | | 188.0
Net wells: | | | | | | 
Productive | | 2.6 | | 14.6 | | 38.6 
Dry | | - | | - | | 0.2 
Total | | 2.6 | | 14.6 | | 38.8 

 
As of December 31, 2016, we were participating in the drilling of 1 gross (0.3 net) development well.
 
We did not drill any exploratory wells in 2016. We drilled three gross (1.7 net) exploratory wells in 2015, all of which were successfully completed as producers. We drilled six gross (2.7 net) exploratory wells in 2014, four of which were successfully completed as producers.
 
Well Operations 
 
We have entered into operating agreements with EnerVest. Under these operating agreements, EnerVest acts as contract operator of the oil and natural gas wells and related gathering systems and production facilities in which we own an interest, if our interest entitles us to control the appointment of the operator of the well, gathering system or production facilities. As contract operator, EnerVest designs and manages the drilling and completion of our wells and manages the day to day operating and maintenance activities for our wells.
 
Under these operating agreements, EnerVest has established a joint account for each well in which we have an interest. We are required to pay our working interest share of amounts charged to the joint account. The joint account is charged with all direct expenses incurred in the operation of our wells and related gathering systems and production facilities. The determination of which direct expenses can be charged to the joint account and the manner of charging direct expenses to the joint account for our wells is done in accordance with the Council of Petroleum Accountants Societies (“COPAS”) model form of accounting procedure.
 
Under the COPAS model form, direct expenses include the costs of third party services performed on our properties and wells, as well as gathering and other equipment used on our properties. In addition, direct expenses include the allocable share of the cost of services performed on our properties and wells by EnerVest employees. The allocation of the cost of EnerVest employees who perform services on our properties is based on time sheets maintained by EnerVest’s employees. Direct expenses charged to the joint account also include an amount determined by EnerVest to be the fair rental value of facilities owned by EnerVest and used in the operation of our properties.
 
Principal Customers, Marketing Arrangements and Delivery Commitments
 
The market for our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production depends on factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, the demand for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, the marketing of competitive fuels and the effect of state and federal regulation. The oil and natural gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers.

Our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production is sold to a variety of purchasers. The terms of sale under the majority of existing contracts are short–term, usually one year or less in duration. The prices received for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids sales are generally tied to monthly or daily indices as quoted in industry publications.
 
In 2016, Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., EnLink Midstream Partners, L.P. and Ergon Oil Purchasing, Inc. accounted for 18.5%, 13.4% and 10.4%, respectively, of our consolidated oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues. In 2015, Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. and EnLink Midstream Partners, L.P. accounted for 17.1% and 10.8%, respectively, of our consolidated oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues. In 2014, no customer accounted for greater than 10% of our consolidated oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues. We believe that the loss of a major customer would have a temporary effect on our revenues but that over time, we would be able to replace our major customers.
 
Information regarding our delivery commitments is contained in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Contractual Obligations” contained herein.
 
Competition 
 
The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from other independent operators and from major oil and natural gas companies in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and staffs substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources will permit.
 
We are also affected by competition for drilling rigs and the availability of related equipment. In the past, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which have delayed development drilling and other exploitation activities and have caused significant price increases. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may occur or how they would affect our development and exploitation program.
 
Competition is also strong for attractive oil and natural gas producing properties, undeveloped leases and drilling rights, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete satisfactorily when attempting to make further acquisitions.
 
Seasonal Nature of Business

Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other operations primarily in certain areas of the Appalachian Basin, the San Juan Basin and Michigan. As a result, we generally perform the majority of our drilling in these areas during the summer and autumn months. In addition, the Monroe Field properties in Louisiana are subject to flooding. These seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our drilling objectives and increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the drilling season, which could lead to shortages and increased costs or delay our operations. Generally demand for natural gas is higher in summer and winter months. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter natural gas requirements during off–peak months. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters and Regulation

Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment as well as the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things:

· | require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | require the installation of pollution control equipment in connection with operations and place other conditions on our operations; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | place restrictions or regulations upon the use or disposal of the material utilized in our operations; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


17
--


· | restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment or used in connection with drilling, production and transportation activities; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | limit or prohibit drilling activities on lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | govern gathering, transportation and marketing of oil and natural gas and pipeline and facilities construction; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as site restoration, pit closure and plugging of abandoned wells; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | require the expenditure of significant amounts in connection with worker health and safety. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, Congress and federal, state and local agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and such changes could result in increased costs for environmental compliance, such as waste handling, permitting, or cleanup for the oil and natural gas industry and could have a significant impact on our operating costs. In general, the oil and natural gas industry has recently been the subject of increased legislation and regulatory attention with respect to environmental matters. The US Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has identified environmental compliance by the energy extraction sector as one of its enforcement initiatives for fiscal years 2017 and 2019 although it is unclear about the outlook for this initiative with the incoming administration.
 
The following is a summary of some of the existing laws, rules and regulations to which our business operations are subject.
 
Solid and Hazardous Waste Handling
 
The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous solid waste. Although oil and natural gas waste generally is exempt from regulations as hazardous waste under RCRA, we generate waste as a routine part of our operations that may be subject to RCRA. Although a substantial amount of the waste generated in our operations are regulated as non–hazardous solid waste rather than hazardous waste, there is no guarantee that the EPA or individual states will not adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non–hazardous or exempt waste or categorize some non–hazardous or exempt waste as hazardous in the future. For example, following the filing of a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in May 2016 by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency’s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016. Under the decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. Non-exempt waste is subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of waste, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, imposes joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of substances designated under CERCLA as hazardous substances. These classes of persons, or so–called potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) include the current and past owners or operators of a site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance found at the site. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the PRPs the costs of such action. Many states have adopted comparable or more stringent state statutes.

18
--

 

Although CERCLA generally exempts “petroleum” from the definition of hazardous substance, in the course of our operations, we have generated and will generate wastes that may fall within CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substance and may have disposed of these wastes at disposal sites owned and operated by others. Comparable state statutes may not provide a comparable exemption for petroleum. We may also be the owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released. To our knowledge, neither we nor our predecessors have been designated as a PRP by the EPA under CERCLA; we also do not know of any prior owners or operators of our properties that are named as PRPs related to their ownership or operation of such properties. In the event contamination is discovered at a site on which we are or have been an owner or operator or to which we sent hazardous substances, we could be liable for the costs of investigation and remediation and natural resources damages.
 
We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years. Although we believe we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations, including offsite locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons were not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. In the future, we could be required to remediate property, including groundwater, containing or impacted by previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators, or property contamination, including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators) or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future or mitigate existing contamination.
 
Clean Water Act
 
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the “Clean Water Act” and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including discharges, spills and leaks of produced water and other oil and natural gas wastes, into state waters and waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by EPA or an analogous state agency. The Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The EPA has issued final rules outlining its position on the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States. This interpretation by the EPA may constitute an expansion of federal jurisdiction over waters of the United States. The rule was stayed nationwide by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in October 2015 as that appellate court and several other courts hear lawsuits opposing implementation of the rule. In January 2017, the United States Supreme Court accepted review of the rule to determine whether jurisdiction rests with the federal district or appellate courts. Litigation surrounding this rule is ongoing. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as require remedial or mitigation measures, for non–compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. In the event of an unauthorized discharge of wastes, we may be liable for penalties and cleanup and response costs.
Safe Drinking Water Act and Hydraulic Fracturing
 
Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing activities are typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions but not at the federal level, as the federal Safe Drinking Water Act expressly excludes regulation of these fracturing activities (except for fracturing activities involving the use of diesel). Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, there have been recent developments at the federal, state, regional and local levels that could result in regulation of hydraulic fracturing becoming more stringent and costly. In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources “under some circumstances,” including water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. This report could result in additional regulatory scrutiny that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and business.

Legislation was introduced in prior sessions of Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing by eliminating the current exemption in the Safe Drinking Water Act, and, further, to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process, but did not pass. Also, some states and local or regional regulatory bodies have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or ban hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances or that require disclosure of chemical in the fracturing fluids. For example, New York has imposed a ban on hydraulic fracturing. Further, Pennsylvania has adopted a variety of regulations limiting how and where fracturing can be performed, and Wyoming and Texas have adopted legislation requiring drilling operators conducting hydraulic fracturing activities in that state to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the fracturing process. States have also considered or adopted other restrictions on drilling and completion operations, including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells; testing of nearby water wells; restrictions on access to, and usage of, water; and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Further, the EPA has published guidance on hydraulic fracturing using diesel and has published an advanced notice of public rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act to develop regulations governing the disclosure and evaluation of hydraulic fracturing chemicals. Further, in June 2016, the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final rule that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands but, in June 2016 a Wyoming federal judge struck down this final rule, finding that the BLM lacked authority to promulgate the rule, and that decision is currently being appealed by the federal government. This litigation remains on appeal.
 
State and federal regulatory agencies have also recently focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas wastewater and an observed increase in minor seismic activity and tremors. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In a few instances, operators of injection wells in the vicinity of minor seismic events have reduced injection volumes or suspended operations, often voluntarily. Some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity. For example, the Texas Railroad Commission rules allow it to modify, suspend, or terminate a permit based on a determination that the permitted activity is likely to be contributing to seismic activity. Regulatory agencies are continuing to study possible linkage between injection activity and induced seismicity.
 
If new laws or regulations imposing significant restrictions or conditions on hydraulic fracturing activities are adopted in areas where we conduct business, we could incur substantial compliance costs and such requirements could adversely delay or restrict our ability to conduct fracturing activities on our assets.
 
Oil Pollution Act 
 
The primary federal law for oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act, or OPA, which amends and augments oil spill provisions of the Clean Water Act and imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain "responsible parties" related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening United States waters or adjoining shorelines. A liable "responsible party" includes the owner or operator of a facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge, or in the case of offshore facilities, the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located. OPA assigns joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA, they are limited. In the event of an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge, we may be liable for costs and damages.
Air Emissions

Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, or CAA, and analogous state laws and local ordinances governing the control of emissions from sources of air pollution. The CAA and analogous state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction. Major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent, federally imposed requirements including additional permits. Federal and state laws designed to control hazardous (or toxic) air pollutants, might require installation of additional controls. Administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air pollution regulations or permits are generally resolved by payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified deficiencies. Alternatively, regulatory agencies could bring lawsuits for civil penalties or seek injunctive relief, requiring us to forego construction, modification or operation of certain air emission sources.

On April 17, 2012, the EPA issued final rules to subject oil and natural gas production, storage, processing and transmission operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards, or NSPS, and the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, or NESHAPS, programs under the CAA, and to impose new and amended requirements under both programs. The EPA rules include NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. Beginning January 1, 2015, operators have been required to capture the natural gas and make it available for use or sale, which can be done through the use of green completions. The standards are applicable to new hydraulically fractured wells and also existing wells that are refractured. Further, the finalized regulations also establish specific new requirements, effective in 2012, for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. These rules may require changes to our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions. We continuously evaluate the effect of new rules on our business.
 
The EPA has adopted rules to regulate methane emissions, including from new and modified oil and gas production sources and natural gas processing and transmission sources, and has announced its intention to regulate methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources, The status of future regulation remains unclear but if adopted could require changes to our operations, including the installation of new emission control equipment. Simultaneously with the methane rules, EPA adopted new rules governing the aggregating of multiple surface sites into a single-source of air quality permitting purposes, a change which could impact the applicability of permitting requirement to our operations and subject certain operations to additional regulatory requirements. We continuously evaluate the effect of these rules on our operations. In late 2016, BLM adopted rules governing flaring and venting on public and tribal lands, which could require additional equipment and emissions controls as well as inspection requirements. These rules have been challenged in court and remain in litigation. Additionally, the US House of Representatives has passed a resolution under the Congressional Review Act disapproving the rules; Senate action remains pending. If allowed to stand, these additional regulations on our air emissions is likely to result in increased compliance costs and additional operating restrictions on our business.
 
National Environmental Policy Act
 
Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, which requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. Depending on the mitigation strategies recommended in the Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement, we could incur added costs, which may be significant. Reviews and decisions under NEPA are also subject to protest or appeal, any or all of which may delay or halt projects. All of our current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay or impose additional conditions upon the development of oil and natural gas projects.
Climate Change Legislation
 
More stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) may be adopted in the future and could cause us to incur material expenses in complying with them. In the absence of comprehensive federal legislation on GHG emission control, the EPA attempted to require the permitting of GHG emissions; although the Supreme Court struck down the permitting requirements, it upheld the EPA’s authority to control GHG emissions when a permit is required due to emissions of other pollutants. Some states, regions and localities have adopted or have considered programs to address GHG emissions. In addition, both houses of Congress previously considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and many states have adopted or considered measures to establish GHG emissions reduction levels, often involving the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs would work by requiring major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances. Federal efforts at a cap and trade program appear to not be moving forward in Congress. Some members of Congress have publicly indicated an intention to introduce legislation to curb EPA’s regulatory authority over GHGs. Depending on the regulatory reach of new CAA legislation implementing regulations or new EPA and/or state, regional or local rules restricting the emission of GHGs, we could incur significant costs to control our emissions and comply with regulatory requirements. In addition, the EPA has adopted a mandatory GHG emissions reporting program which imposes reporting and monitoring requirements on various industries, including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and natural gas processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. Compliance with these requirements has and is anticipated to require us to make investments in monitoring and recordkeeping equipment. We do not believe, however, that our compliance with applicable monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements under GHG reporting program as recently amended will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. We have submitted annual reports for emissions starting with our 2012 GHG emissions.

The EPA has adopted rules to regulate methane emissions, including from new and modified oil and gas production sources and natural gas processing and transmission sources. Further EPA has announced its intention to regulate methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources but the status of future regulation on existing sources remains unclear; if adopted, it could require changes to our operations, including the installation of new emission control equipment. Simultaneously with the methane rules for new and modified sources, EPA adopted new rules governing the aggregating of multiple surface sites into a single-source of air quality permitting purposes, a change which could impact the applicability of permitting requirement to our operations and subject certain operations to additional regulatory requirements. We continuously evaluate the effect of these rules on our operations.
 
Because of the lack of any comprehensive legislative program addressing GHGs, there is a great deal of uncertainty as to how and when federal regulation of GHGs might take place. Moreover, the federal, regional, state and local regulatory initiatives also could adversely affect the marketability of the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce. The impact of such future programs cannot be predicted, but we do not expect our operations to be affected any differently than other similarly situated domestic competitors.
 
Endangered Species Act
 
The Endangered Species Act was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to that act, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities that would harm the species or that would adversely affect that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We conduct operations on oil and natural gas leases that have species that are listed and species that could be listed as threatened or endangered under the act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designates the species’ protected habitat as part of the effort to protect the species. A protected habitat designation or the mere presence of threatened or endangered species could result in material restrictions to our use of the land and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. It also may adversely impact the value of the affected leases.
 
OSHA and Other Laws and Regulation

To the extent not preempted by other applicable laws, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes, where applicable. These laws and the implementing regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right–to–know regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes, where applicable, require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements and with other OSHA and comparable state statute requirements.
 
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our current operations and that our continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We did not incur any material capital expenditures for remediation or pollution control activities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Additionally, we are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures during 2017 or that will otherwise have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in the future. However, we cannot assure you that the passage of more stringent laws and regulations in the future will not have a negative impact our business activities, financial condition, results of operations or ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.
 
Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
 
The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state, local and tribal authorities. Rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry are under constant review for amendment or expansion, which could increase the regulatory burden and the potential for financial sanctions for noncompliance. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.

Drilling and Production
 
Statutes, rules and regulations affecting exploration and production undergo constant review and often are amended, expanded and reinterpreted, making difficult the prediction of future costs or the impact of regulatory compliance attributable to new laws and statutes. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business and, consequently, affects its profitability. Our drilling and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. Most states and some counties and municipalities in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following:

· | the location of wells; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | the method of drilling, completing and operating wells; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the venting or flaring of natural gas; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the plugging and abandoning of wells; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | notice to surface owners and other third parties; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | produced water and disposal of waste water, drilling fluids and other liquids and solids utilized or produced in the drilling and extraction process. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
State and federal regulations are generally intended to prevent waste of oil and natural gas, protect correlative rights to produce oil and natural gas between owners in a common reservoir or formation, control the amount of oil and natural gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production and control contamination of the environment. Pipelines and natural gas plants operated by other companies that provide midstream services to us are also subject to the jurisdiction of various federal, state and local authorities, which can affect our operations. State laws also regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties and impose bonding requirements in order to drill and operate wells. Some states have taken up consideration of forced pooling. Other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases.
 
States generally impose a production, ad valorem or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil and natural gas within their respective jurisdictions. States do not generally regulate wellhead prices or engage in other, similar direct economic regulation, but there can be no assurance they will not do so in the future.
 
We do not control the availability of transportation and processing facilities used in the marketing of our production. For example, we may have to shut–in a productive natural gas well because of a lack of available natural gas gathering or transportation facilities.
 
If we conduct operations on federal, state or Indian oil and natural gas leases, these operations must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions, including various non–discrimination statutes, royalty and related valuation requirements, and certain of these operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security regulations and other appropriate permits issued by the Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”), Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, Bureau of Indian Affairs, tribal or other appropriate federal, state and/or Indian tribal agencies.
 
The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (the “Mineral Act”) prohibits ownership of any direct or indirect interest in federal onshore oil and natural gas leases by a foreign citizen or a foreign entity except through equity ownership in a corporation formed under the laws of the United States or of any U.S. State or territory, and only if the laws, customs, or regulations of their country of origin or domicile do not deny similar or like privileges to citizens or entities of the United States. If these restrictions are violated, the oil and natural gas lease can be canceled in a proceeding instituted by the United States Attorney General. We qualify as an entity formed under the laws of the United States or of any U.S. State or territory. Although the regulations promulgated and administered by the BLM pursuant to the Mineral Act provide for agency designations of non–reciprocal countries, there are presently no such designations in effect. It is possible that our unitholders may be citizens of foreign countries and do not own their units in a U.S corporation or even if such interest held through a U.S. corporation, their country of citizenship may be determined to be a non–reciprocal country under the Mineral Act. In such event, any federal onshore oil and natural gas leases held by us could be subject to cancellation based on such determination.

Federal Regulation of Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids, including Regulation of Transportation
 
The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of natural gas are subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to natural gas pipeline transportation. FERC’s regulations for interstate natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas. FERC regulates the rates, terms and conditions applicable to the interstate transportation of natural gas by pipelines under the Natural Gas Act as well as under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act.
 
Since 1985, FERC has implemented regulations intended to increase competition within the natural gas industry by making natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open-access, nondiscriminatory basis.
 
Sales of our oil and natural gas liquids are also affected by the availability, terms and costs of transportation. The rates, terms, and conditions applicable to the interstate transportation of oil and natural gas liquids by pipelines are regulated by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act. The FERC has implemented a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for interstate oil and natural gas liquids pipelines to fulfill the requirements of Title XVIII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 comprised of an indexing system to establish ceilings on interstate oil and natural gas liquids pipeline rates.
 
The pipelines used to gather and transport natural gas being produced by us are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended (“NGPSA”), the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, as reauthorized and amended (“Pipeline Safety Act”), and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011. The DOT Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) has established a risk–based approach to determine which gathering pipelines are subject to regulation and what safety standards regulated gathering pipelines must meet. In August 2011, the PHMSA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding pipeline safety, including questions regarding the modification of regulations applicable to gathering lines in rural areas.
 
Transportation of our oil, natural gas liquids and purity components (ethane, propane, butane, iso–butane, and natural gasoline) by rail is also subject to regulation by the DOT’s PHMSA and the DOT’s Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”) under the Hazardous Materials Regulations at 49 CFR Parts 171-180 (“HMR”), including Emergency Orders by the FRA and new regulations being proposed by the PHMSA, arising due to the consequences of train accidents and the increase in the rail transportation of flammable liquids.
 
In addition, the U.S. federal government has recently ended its decades–old prohibition of exports of oil produced in the lower–48 states of the U.S. It is too recent an event to determine the impact this regulatory change may have on our operations or our sales of oil.
 
Although natural gas sales prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on the operations of the underlying properties. Sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices.
 
Hydraulic Fracturing
 
Most of our oil and natural gas properties are subject to hydraulic fracturing to economically develop the properties. The hydraulic fracturing process is integral to our drilling and completion costs in these areas and typically represent up to 60% of the total drilling/completion costs per well.
 
We diligently review best practices and industry standards, and comply with all regulatory requirements in the protection of these potable water sources. Protective practices include, but are not limited to, setting multiple strings of protection pipe across the potable water sources and cementing these pipes from setting depth to surface, continuously monitoring the hydraulic fracturing process in real time, and disposing of all non–commercially produced fluids in certified disposal wells at depths below the potable water sources.
 

24
--

 

In compliance with laws enacted in various states, we will disclose hydraulic fracturing data to the appropriate chemical registry. These laws generally require disclosure for each chemical ingredient that is subject to the requirements of OSHA regulations, as well as the total volume of water used in the hydraulic fracturing treatment.
 
There have not been any material incidents, citations or suits related to our hydraulic fracturing activities involving violations of environmental laws and regulations.
 
Other Regulation
 
In addition to the regulation of oil and natural gas pipeline transportation rates, the oil and natural gas industry generally is subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to occupational safety, resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect upon our unitholders.
Insurance
 
In accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. We currently have insurance policies that include coverage for control of well, general liability (includes sudden and accidental pollution), physical damage to our oil and gas natural properties, auto liability, worker's compensation and employer's liability, among other things.
 
Currently, we have general liability insurance coverage up to $1.0 million per occurrence, which includes sudden and accidental environmental liability coverage for the effects of pollution on third parties arising from our operations. Our insurance policies contain maximum policy limits and in most cases, deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. These insurance policies are subject to certain customary exclusions and limitations. In addition, we maintain $100.0 million in excess liability coverage, which is in addition to and triggered if the general liability per occurrence limit is reached.
 
We do not currently have any insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations. However, we believe our general liability and excess liability insurance policies would cover third party claims related to hydraulic fracturing operations and associated legal expenses, in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of such policies.
 
We re–evaluate the purchase of insurance, coverage limits and deductibles annually. Future insurance coverage for the oil and natural gas industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are economically acceptable. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable, and we may elect to self–insure or maintain only catastrophic coverage for certain risks in the future.
 
Employees 
 
EV Management, the general partner of our general partner, has seven full time employees who spend a significant amount of their time on our operations. At December 31, 2016, EnerVest, the sole member of EV Management, had approximately 1,100 full–time employees, including over 103 geologists, engineers and land professionals. To carry out our operations, EnerVest employs the people who will provide direct support to our operations. None of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider EV Management’s relationship with its employees to be good, and EnerVest considers its relationship with its employees to be good.
Offices
 
We do not have any material owned or leased property (other than our interests in oil and gas properties). Under our omnibus agreement, EnerVest provides us office space for our executive officers and other employees at EnerVest’s offices in Houston, Texas.
