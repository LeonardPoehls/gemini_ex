Overview
 
We are a healthy functional beverage company engaged in the development, marketing, sales and distribution of a portfolio of Ready-to-Drink (“RTD”) better-for-you beverages including competitive entrants currently in the kombucha, RTD tea, premium bottled water, and energy drinks segments. We differentiate our brands through functional characteristics and ingredients and offer all natural and organic products, with no high-fructose corn syrup (“HFCS”), no-Genetically Modified Organisms (“GMOs”), probiotics, no preservatives, and only all natural flavors, fruits, and ingredients. We aspire to be a market leader in the development and commercialization of healthy beverage alternatives. Our target market is currently health conscious consumers, who are individuals who are becoming more interested and better educated on what is included in their diets, causing them to shift away from options perceived as less healthy such as carbonated soft drinks or other high caloric beverages, and towards alternative beverages choices.
Corporate History
 
New Age Beverages Corporation was formed under the laws of the State of Washington on April 26, 2010, under the name American Brewing Company, Inc. As part of a recapitalization and amendment to our articles of incorporation on September 25, 2013, we also converted its corporate entity from an “S” Corporation to a “C” Corporation.
 
On April 1, 2015, we acquired the Assets of B&R Liquid Adventure, which included the brand, Búcha® Live Kombucha. Prior to acquiring the Búcha Live Kombucha® brand and business, we were a craft brewery operation. On October 1, 2015, American Brewing agreed to sell their brewery, brewery assets and its related liabilities to focus exclusively on the healthy functional beverage category and the Búcha® brand. The assets sold consisted of accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid assets and property and equipment. We recognized the sale of our brewery and micro-brewing operations as a discontinued operation beginning in the third quarter of 2015, and ultimately concluded the transaction in May 2016. In May 2016 we changed our name to Búcha, Inc. On June 30, 2016, we acquired the combined assets of New Age Beverages, LLC, Aspen Pure, LLC, New Age Properties, and Xing Beverage, LLC, relocated the Company’s operational headquarters to Denver, Colorado, and changed our name to New Age Beverages Corporation.
 
We have two wholly-owned subsidiaries, NABC, Inc., and NABC Properties, LLC.
 
Principal products
 
Our core business is to market, sell, and distribute our current brands including XingTea®, XingEnergy®, Aspen Pure®, and Bucha® Live Kombucha brands, and to develop new healthy functional beverage products. We compete in the healthy functional beverage segment, which is the growth area of RTD beverages, as consumers gravitate toward better for you beverage choices and away from traditionally large beverage categories including juices and carbonated soft drinks.
 
XingTea®
 
XingTea® is an all-natural, non-GMO, non-HFCS, RTD tea.
 
XingTea® is made with green teas, softened with black teas, and further differentiated with unique all-natural fruit flavors, with no preservatives, GMOs or HFCS. Sweetened with honey and only pure cane sugar, XingTea® comes in 14 natural sweetened and unsweetened flavors in a range of packages from 23.5 oz cans to 16 oz Pet multipacks and gallon jugs, and is produced in New Age’s network of six manufacturers across the United States.
 
XingTea® is sold in 46 states and 10 countries across multiple channels of distribution from traditional grocery to health food and specialty outlets to hypermarkets to club stores, to gas and convenience outlets. XingTea® is the number one ranking tasting tea in North America of 250 other brands, won the North American Tea competition, and has less than one half the calories of major competitors, and is sweetened with Honey and Pure Cane Sugar vs. major competitors that predominantly use high fructose corn syrup in their products. XingTea® competes in the RTD Tea category that according to Euromonitor International exceeded $50 Billion in annual revenue. According to the World Research Report, the RTD Tea Market has been averaging a 10.9% compound annual growth rate since 2012, and is expected to reach a combined size of $125 Billion in 2017.
 
XingEnergy®
 
XingEnergy® is an all-natural, non-GMO, non-HFCS, vitamin-enriched, better-for-you Energy Drink, made with all natural fruit flavors and contains the full recommended daily allowance of B-Complex vitamins.
 
XingEnergy® comes in four flavors including Tangerine Dream, Grape Attack, Mad Melon, and Grapefruit Go packaged in 16 oz cans, sold individually, expanding now to additional channels. XingEnergy® competes in the Energy Drinks category, and according to Investopedia, the global Energy Drink Market size was $49.9 Billion in 2014.

Aspen Pure® PH and Aspen Pure® Probiotic
 
Aspen Pure® PH is a naturally PH-balanced, artesian-well sourced water from the Colorado Rocky Mountains, and Aspen Pure® Probiotic is one of the world’s first, shelf-stable (no refrigeration required) probiotic water, with more than 12 different probiotic strains and more than 12 billion CFU’s (colony forming units (probiotics)) in every serving, and 2 years of shelf-life
 
Aspen Pure® has no added minerals or electrolytes, and comes out of the ground at a natural PH-balanced level of up to 7.0. Aspen Pure® is then purified and bottled at the source in New Age’s own manufacturing facilities. Aspen Pure® competes in the Premium Bottled Water Category. According to Beverage Marketing Corporation, global bottled water sales reached 87 Billion Gallons in 2015 and experienced a compound annual growth rate 6.9% between 2010 and 2015. According to Transparency International the Market size for bottled water was $169.9 Billion in 2015.
 
Búcha® Live Kombucha
 
Búcha® Live Kombucha is a certified-organic, all-natural, non-GMO, non-HFCS, fermented Kombucha tea with more than two billion CFU’s in every serving.
 
Búcha® is produced with a unique and proprietary manufacturing process that eliminates the common vinegary aftertaste associated with many other Kombuchas and provides the brand with an industry leading nine-month shelf life as compared to the typical 90-day shelf life of our competitors’ products. The production process also leads to consistency and stability with no risk of secondary fermentation, secondary alcohol production, incremental sugar production or over-carbonation, and is one of the world’s first Kombucha’s that is shelf-stable (no refrigeration required) with no degradation to flavor or the probiotics organisms in every serving.
 
Búcha® is made from black teas, proprietary kombucha culture and probiotics, unique yeast strains and cultures, and all natural organic fruits and flavors. Búcha® Live Kombucha comes in seven flavors including Raspberry Pomegranate, Blood Orange, Guava Mango, Grapefruit Sage, Elderflower Green Tea, Yuzu Lemon, and Tropical Honey Blossom Ginger packaged in 16 oz glass bottles. The brand is sold in traditional grocery and health food and specialty outlets, and is beginning to expand distribution from California across the United States in mainstream retail and down the street outlets with the support of major DSD partners. Búcha® competes in the Kombucha Category, that according to Grand View Research reached $700 million in 2015 from $49 million in 2011, a compound annual growth rate of 69.3%.
 
In October of 2016, we entered into a management agreement, pursuant to which we took over the Sales, Marketing and Distribution of the Marley Beverage Company. The management agreement enabled the Company to enter into the RTD Coffee segment and Relaxation Beverages segment with the brands Marley One Drop® and Marley Mellow Mood®. While both companies continue to be separate entities both operationally and financially, the addition to the portfolio enables us to increase our relevance with key retailer and distributor partners with a broader portfolio of offerings, and enables the Marley Beverage Company to leverage our infrastructure, sales force and scale.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We differentiate our brands primarily through functional points of difference between our products and those of our competitors, including the characteristics of being certified organic and/or all natural, containing no GMO and no preservatives, being sweetened with only honey or pure cane sugar, and containing fewer calories, shelf-stable or longer shelf life, and other functional benefits than our competitors’ products. In addition, we have begun to build the emotional benefit platforms behind each of our brands.
Direct Store Delivery Distribution Network
 
We have our own DSD distribution group in Colorado and a network of other DSD partners in major geographies throughout the United States. Our Colorado DSD group includes 24 truck routes, with a 20 person sales team, and a 20 person merchandising team, covering more than 4,500 outlets for more than 60 brands and more than 600 sku’s. The DSD arm of our business is a test bed for new products before national rollout, provides an early warning system for any new emerging competitive brands or beverage segments, and gives the group near captive control of the shelf space across the 6,000 outlets the group services. In addition to our own DSD distribution, the Company has spent the past 10 years developing a national DSD network with other major DSD regional and independent operators. The Company’s own network coupled with its national DSD partner network, represents a significant competitive advantage and barrier to entry for many other smaller beverage companies.
 
Beverage distributors can distribute their products directly through customer warehouses, but distribution via DSD is preferred by customers, as it substantially reduces labor and other overhead costs when distributors manage the freight, stocking and merchandising of their products directly to the retailers’ shelves. Although it is more expensive for the brand owner, the benefits of captive shelf space, merchandising at the point of sale, and penetration of a significantly greater number of smaller and independent outlets justify the added expense.

Reliance on Third Party Suppliers and Distributors
 
We rely on various suppliers for the raw and packaging materials, production, sale and distribution of our products. Our third party distribution providers are for certain areas of the country that are outside of our owned DSD distribution network. The material terms of these relationships are typically annually negotiated and include pricing, quality standards, delivery times and conditions, purchase orders, and payment terms. Payment terms are typically net 30, meaning that the total invoiced amount is expected to be paid in full within 30 days from when the date on which the products or services are provided. We believe that we have sufficient options for each of our raw and packaging material needs, as well as our third party distribution needs and also have long term relationships with each of our suppliers and distributors, resulting in consistency in quality and supply. We also believe that we have sufficient breadth of retail relationships with distribution in both large and small retailers and independents and across multiple channels (mass, club, pharmacies, convenience, and small and large format retailers) throughout the United States.
 
The contractual arrangements with all third parties, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers are typical of the beverage industry with standard terms. We have no long-term obligations with any of the third parties nor do any of them have long-term obligations with us. The third party supplier, manufacturing and distribution agreements were entered into in the normal course of business within the guidelines of industry practices and are not deemed material and definite.
 
Significant Customers
 
For the year ended December 31, 2016 (Successor), three customers represented approximately 27.5% (14.5%, 7.5% and 5.5%) of revenue. As of December 31, 2015 (Successor), three customers represented approximately 92.8% (59.0%, 22.9% and 10.9%) of accounts receivable. For the nine months ended December 31, 2015 (Successor), three customers represented approximately 75.5% (32.7%, 24.2% and 18.6%) of revenue. For the three months ended March 31, 2015 (Predecessor), three customers represented approximately 84.5% (28.1%, 18.9% and 18.6%) of revenue.
Marketing and Consumer Connection Expertise To Next Generation Consumers
 
We have the marketing capability to facilitate connections with consumers, and to build awareness, drive trial, begin conversion, and develop brand preference amongst consumers, and do so in a cost effective manner. We possess significant internal marketing expertise spanning development of communication and programs across all marketing mediums. To effectively compete against major beverage companies, we focus most of our activities on in-store merchandising, experiential and event marketing, and social and digital marketing activities. Further developing these capabilities to connect with millennials and more informed and health conscious consumers will further differentiate our marketing capabilities to connect with a targeted set of consumers and do so in a cost advantaged manner.
Infrastructure, Organizational Capabilities
 
In addition to having an asset footprint that includes our own warehousing, our own trucks and DSD assets, our own manufacturing, and a network of other long-term manufacturing partners, we have a full scale of resources across every major function with depth in supply chain, production, procurement, shipping, finance, sales, marketing, distribution, and research and development. We define organizational capability strength as having the people, the processes, the systems, the information and the environment/culture to deliver superior, sustainable, and profitable organic growth. We are emplacing initiatives in each of the areas of organizational capabilities to strengthen the metric-driven, performance-oriented organization.

Experienced Leadership Team
 
Each member of our leadership team at New Age possesses 15 to 25 years of experience in the beverage industry, spanning all facets of beverage operations. The combination of operating skills from our management team with the experience of successfully leading major multi-billion dollar, multinational beverage companies gives our organization a significant strength relative to most small- and medium-sized beverage companies.
Growth Strategies
 
Our long-term objective is to become a major healthy functional beverage company. Based on available information, we believe we are one of the top 20 healthy beverage companies worldwide today. We intend to achieve our goal by driving organic growth behind our existing portfolio of healthy functional beverages, in all relevant packages and product formats, across all major retail channels, in all major markets, through an aligned network of retailer and distributor partners.
 
Our key growth strategies include the following:
 

● | Drive Pervasive Availability on Expanded Brand Portfolio via a Key Account, Multi-Channel, Hybrid Route-to-Market Approach; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recent Developments
 
On January 10, 2017, our wholly owned subsidiary, NABC Properties, LLC, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with an unaffiliated third party. Pursuant to the agreement, NABC Properties, LLC entered into a commitment to sell the property located at 1700 E 68th Avenue, Denver, CO 80229 for a purchase price of $8,900,000. $100,000 of the purchase price was paid upon execution of the agreement, with the balance of $8,800,000 to be paid on or before March 31, 2017. The agreement contains a lease back provision, whereby NABC Properties, LLC shall lease the property for an initial term of ten years, with an option to extend for two successive five year periods. The lease cost is $52,000 per month for the initial year, with two percent annual increases.
Sales and Marketing
 
We currently have an in-house sales and merchandising team consisting of approximately 75 individuals throughout the United States, whose compensation is highly variable and highly performance-based. Each sales person has individual targets for increasing “base” volume through distribution expansion, and “incremental” volume through promotions and other in-store merchandising and display activity. As distribution to new major customers, new major channels, or new major markets increases, we will expand the sales and marketing team on a variable basis.
 
We market our products using a range of marketing mediums including in-store merchandising and promotions, experiential marketing, events, and sponsorships, digital marketing and social media, direct marketing, and traditional media including print, radio, outdoor, and TV.

Distribution
 
Our products are currently distributed in 10 countries internationally, and in 46 states domestically through a hybrid of four routes to market including our own direct store distribution (“DSD”) system that reaches more than 6,000 outlets, and to more than 20,000 other outlets throughout the United States directly through customer’s warehouses, through our network of DSD partners, and through our network of brokers and natural product distributors. Our products are sold through multiple channels including major grocery retail, natural food retail, specialty outlets, hypermarkets, club stores, pharmacies, convenience stores and gas stations.
 
Our sales strategy is to distribute our products worldwide through a series of distributors to retail consumers. We are relying on distribution relationships to grow and maintain revenues. Presently, we have several distribution agreements in place for our products in the United States, as well as internationally.
 
We do not obtain commitments from our distributors to purchase or sell a minimum amount of our products or to purchase or sell such products at a minimum price. Because our sales may be concentrated with a few customers, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected if one of these customers significantly reduces the volume of its purchases or demands a reduction in price, which may occur at any time due to the absence of such purchase commitments.
 
Research and Development Activities 
 
Our research and development efforts are focused on two primary paths. The first is to continually review our existing formulas and production processes and structure to evaluate opportunities for cost of goods sold improvements, without degrading the quality or fundamentally changing the consumer appeal taste profile of our existing products. The second major research and development effort is in the development of new flavors or adding in new trending functional characteristics to our existing products, and to develop new beverage types based on consumer insights and trends. The Company’s mission to only provide healthy functional beverages governs our development efforts.
Seasonality
 
We experience some seasonality whereby the peak summer months show a higher level of sales and consumption. However, the structure of our business and range of products in our portfolio mitigate any major fluctuations. Our revenue during the peak summer months have historically been approximately 20% greater than the peak winter months, and as our portfolio and geographic penetration have further expanded, the level of seasonal peaks has diminished.
Competition
 
The beverage industry, specifically the healthy beverage industry, is highly competitive. We face intense competition from very large, international corporations, as well as from local and national companies. In addition, we face competition from well-known companies that have large market share.
 
The intensity of competition in the future is expected to increase and no assurance can be provided that we can sustain our market position or expand our business.
 
Many of our current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational resources, and name recognition than we have. However, we believe that with our diverse product line, consisting of kombucha tea, green tea, water and energy beverages, it will give us the ability to obtain a large market share, and continue to generate sales and compete in the industry.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
We hold United States trademarks, Serial Numbers 86694956 and 85087186 for Bucha®. We also hold United States trademarks, Serial Numbers 85025636 and 76438612 for Aspen Pure®, Serial Number 85347345 for Just Pure Water®, Serial Number 77312629 for XingEnergy®, Serial Number 77050595 for XingTea®, and Serial Number 77312679 for Xing Soda®, all of which were acquired in our acquisition of Xing. Any encroachment upon our proprietary information, including the unauthorized use of our brand name, the use of a similar name by a competing company or a lawsuit initiated either by us or against us for infringement upon proprietary information or improper use of a trademark, may affect our ability to create brand name recognition, cause customer confusion and/or have a detrimental effect on our business due to the cost of defending any potential litigation related to infringement. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. or International Patent and Trademark Offices may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and/or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation or adverse proceeding could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could seriously harm our business operations and/or results of operations.

Government and Industry Regulation
 
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. These laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture, safety, labeling, transportation, advertising and sale of our products. Violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacture, safety, labeling, transportation and advertising of our products could damage our reputation and/or result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties. For example, changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on our beverages and our ingredients could increase our costs. Regulatory focus on the health, safety and marketing of beverage products is increasing. Certain federal or state regulations or laws affecting the labeling of our products, such as California’s “Prop 65,” which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects, are or could become applicable to our products. At this time, our products do not require government approval, but as federal or state laws change, the manufacture or quality of our products may become subject to additional regulation.
 
We are also subject to the Securities Act, the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and Washington and Colorado Corporation Law. We will also be subject to common business and tax rules and regulations pertaining to the operation of our business, such as the United States Internal Revenue Tax Code and the Washington and Colorado State Tax Codes, as well as international tax codes and shipping tariffs. We will also be subject to proprietary regulations such as United States Trademark and Patent Law as it applies to the intellectual property of third parties. We believe that the effects of existing or probable governmental regulations will be additional responsibilities of management to ensure that we are in compliance with securities regulations as they apply to our products as well as ensuring that we do not infringe on any proprietary rights of others with respect to our products. We will also need to maintain accurate financial records in order to remain compliant with securities regulations as well as any corporate tax liability we incur.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this prospectus, we have 130 fulltime employees. Our activities are managed by our officers and directors.
 
Property
 
Our operations, packaging and distribution are currently being conducted out of the offices located at 1700 E. 68th Avenue, Denver, CO 80229. We hold a note that is collateralized by the building on our Colorado property (until the planned sale on March 31, 2017), for which we pay $26,000 per month in principal and interest. We consider the current space to be adequate and will reassess our needs based upon future growth. Our manufacturing facilities are located in Alamosa, Colorado for our Aspen Pure product.
