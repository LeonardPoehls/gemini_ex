Item 1.  Business
Overview
 Earthstone Energy, Inc. (together with our consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” “our,” “we,” “us,” “Earthstone” or similar terms), a Delaware corporation formed in 1969, is a growth-oriented independent oil and natural gas development and production company.  In addition, the Company is active in corporate mergers and the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties that have production and future development opportunities.  Our operations are all in the upstream segment of the oil and natural gas industry and all our properties are onshore in the United States. 
 Our reserve portfolio primarily consists of assets in the Midland Basin of west Texas, the Eagle Ford trend of south Texas and in the Williston Basin of North Dakota. We have approximately 5,900 net leasehold acres in the Midland Basin, representing an average 40% working interest, located in Howard, Glasscock, Martin and Midland Counties. We have approximately 21,000 net leasehold acres in the Eagle Ford trend of south Texas, including approximately 18,000 net leasehold acres in the crude oil window in Fayette, Gonzales and Karnes Counties, with working interests ranging from approximately 25% to 50%, and approximately 3,000 net leasehold acres located in the natural gas and condensate window in La Salle County, with working interests averaging approximately 11%. In the Williston Basin of North Dakota, we have approximately 5,900 net leasehold acres, with working interests ranging from approximately 1% to 6%. 
 Our corporate headquarters are located in The Woodlands, Texas. We also have an operating office in Denver, Colorado and two field offices in south Texas. Our common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”) is traded on the NYSE MKT under the symbol ESTE.  
 Recent Developments 
 Acquisitions
 On November 7, 2016, we entered into a contribution agreement (the “Bold Contribution Agreement”), by and among the Company, Earthstone Energy Holdings, LLC, a newly formed Delaware limited liability company (“EEH”), Lynden USA, Inc., a Utah corporation (“Lynden USA”), an existing subsidiary of Earthstone,  Lynden USA Operating, LLC, a newly formed Texas limited liability company (all wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company), Bold Energy Holdings, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Bold Holdings”), and Bold Energy III LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Bold”).
 Under the Bold Contribution Agreement, the terms of which were unanimously approved by a special committee of disinterested members of the Company’s Board of Directors and the full Board (i) the Company will recapitalize the Common Stock into two classes, consisting of Class A and Class B, and all of its existing Common Stock will be converted into Class A common stock. Bold Holdings will purchase approximately 36.1 million shares of the Company’s Class B common stock for nominal consideration, with the Class B common stock having no economic rights in the Company other than voting rights on a pari passu basis with the Class A common stock. In addition, EEH will issue approximately 22.3 million of its membership units to the Company and Lynden USA, in the aggregate, and approximately 36.1 million membership units to Bold Holdings in exchange for each of the Company, Lynden USA and Bold Holdings transferring all of their assets to EEH; and (iii) each Bold Holdings’ membership unit in EEH, together with one share of Bold Holdings Class B common stock, will be convertible into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. Therefore, upon the closing of Bold Contribution Agreement, stockholders of the Company and unitholders of Bold Holdings are expected to own approximately 39% and 61%, respectively of the combined company’s then outstanding Class A and Class B common stock on a fully diluted basis. After closing, the Company expects conduct its activities through EEH and will be its sole managing member. The Bold Contribution Agreement is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017 and is subject to approval of the Company’s stockholders and other customary closing conditions.
 In May 2016, we acquired Lynden Energy Corp. (“Lynden”) in an all-stock transaction. The acquisition was made through an arrangement (the “Lynden Arrangement”) instead of a merger because Lynden is incorporated in British Columbia, Canada. The Company acquired all the outstanding shares of common stock of Lynden through a newly formed Company subsidiary, with Lynden surviving in the Lynden Arrangement as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company issued 3,700,279 shares of its common stock to the holders of Lynden common stock in the Lynden Arrangement. 
 Non-Recent Acquisitions 
 In December 2014, we acquired three operating subsidiaries of Oak Valley Resources, LLC, a privately-held Delaware limited liability company (“OVR”), in exchange for shares of our Common Stock (the “Exchange”), which resulted in a change of control. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, OVR contributed to us the membership interests of its three subsidiaries, Earthstone Operating, 
 8


LLC (formerly Oak Valley Operating, LLC) (“OVO”), EF Non-Op, LLC (“EF Non-Op”) and Sabine River Energy, LLC (“Sabine”), each a Texas limited liability company (collectively “Oak Valley”), in exchange for approximately 9.124 million shares, representing 84% of our Common Stock. The Exchange was accounted for as a reverse acquisition whereby Oak Valley was considered the acquirer for accounting purposes. All historical financial information contained in this report is that of Oak Valley. Upon the closing of the Exchange, we changed our fiscal year from March 31 to December 31 in order for our fiscal year end to correspond with the fiscal year end of OVR and its subsidiaries.
 Immediately following the Exchange, we acquired an additional 20% undivided ownership interest in certain crude oil and natural gas properties located in Fayette and Gonzales Counties, Texas, in exchange for the issuance of approximately 2.957 million shares of our Common Stock (the “Flatonia Contribution Agreement”) to Flatonia Energy, LLC (“Flatonia”), increasing our ownership in these properties from a 30% undivided ownership to a 50% undivided ownership interest. As a result of the share issuance to Flatonia, OVR’s ownership in us decreased from 84% to 66%.
 For further discussion of the above closed acquisitions, see Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.
 Our Business Strategy 
 We pursue a value-driven growth strategy focused on projects that we believe will generate strong and predictable rates of return and increases in stockholder value. Although we currently have significant non-operated properties, our intent is to operate the majority of our properties in order to control costs and direct the efficient development of such properties in an effort to optimize investment returns and profitability. Historically, we have operated the majority of our assets and implemented our strategy in multiple basins in order to enable us to benefit from regional changes and differences in realized prices, service costs, service availability and numerous other factors that would enhance the timely, cost-efficient and economic development of our assets, and lead to greater rates of return.  This multi-basin strategy could change in the future and we could focus all or a majority of our capital expenditures in a single basin, as a result of acquisitions, project economics and capital market considerations. Management concentrates on building production, reserves and cash flows while seeking to expand our undeveloped acreage and drilling inventory. Further expansion of our asset base will be achieved through cost efficient development, exploitation and operation of our current assets and acreage and through additional leasing, acquisitions, development, drilling and, to a lesser extent, exploration activities, currently directed toward unconventional oil-weighted projects. Finally, management intends to pursue corporate and asset acquisition opportunities. 
 Our business strategy includes the following:
  
• | pursuing value-accretive corporate merger and acquisition opportunities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanding our operated acreage positions and drilling inventory in our areas of primary interest through acquisitions and farm-in opportunities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continuing the cost-effective development and exploitation of our existing acreage positions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | generating additional development projects in our areas of primary interest;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | divesting non-core assets in order to streamline operations and utilize capital and human resources most effectively;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintaining a strong balance sheet and capital structure; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtaining additional capital, as needed and available, through the issuance of equity and debt securities or by soliciting industry or financial participants to jointly develop and/or acquire assets
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our fundamental operating and technical strategy is complemented by our focus on increasing stockholder value by our efforts in:
  
• | maximizing profit margins;
--+---------------------------


• | controlling capital expenditures and operating and administrative costs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | promoting industry or institutional participants into projects to manage risk, enhance rates of return and lower net finding and development costs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Management believes its strategy is appropriate because it addresses multiple risks of oil and natural gas operations while providing equity holders with upside potential and results in “staying power,” which management believes is essential to mitigate the adverse impacts of historically volatile commodity prices and financial markets.

Our Operations
 We are currently the operator of properties containing approximately 38% of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and 58% of our proved PV-10 as of December 31, 2016 (see reconciliation of PV-10 to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows in Item 2. Properties). As operator, we are able to directly influence development and production of operations of our operated properties. Our producing properties have reasonably predictable production profiles and cash flows, subject to commodity price fluctuations. Our status as an operator has allowed us to pursue the development of undeveloped acreage, further develop existing properties and generate new projects that we believe have the potential to increase stockholder value.
 As is common in our industry, we participate in non-operated properties on a selective basis. Decisions to participate in non-operated properties are dependent upon the technical and economic nature of the projects and the operating expertise and financial standing of the operators.
 Description of Major Properties
 The following is a brief description of our primary oil and natural gas properties: 
 Midland Basin
 We have a non-operated position of approximately 5,900 net acres in the Midland Basin of west Texas. At present, our most active area within the basin is the horizontal Wolfcamp play occurring in Howard, Glasscock, Martin and Midland Counties, Texas. We have approximately 112 gross vertical and 5 gross horizontal producing wells with an average working interest of approximately 40% that are primarily operated by Crownquest Operating, LLC. We have identified approximately 180 gross horizontal locations in various benches of the Wolfcamp and Lower Spraberry as well as approximately 118 gross vertical wells that have potential in the Clearfork, Spraberry, Wolfcamp, Strawn and Fusselman formations.
 Upon the closing of the Bold Contribution Agreement, we expect to have an operated position in approximately 20,900 net acres in the core of the Midland Basin across Reagan, Upton, Midland, Glasscock, Howard and Martin counties. The acreage is approximately 99% operated with an average working interest of approximately 85%.  Current internal estimates indicate approximately 500 gross, largely de-risked operated drilling locations, the vast majority of which are in certain   benches of the Wolfcamp A and B formation in the Lower Spraberry formation. Based on industry drilling and production operations additional locations may be proven to be economic, primarily in Reagan and Upton counties, in added benches in the Wolfcamp A, B and C and other formations. 
 Eagle Ford Basin
 Operated Eagle Ford
 As of December 31, 2016, we owned approximately 36,000 gross (17,600 net) leasehold acres in Fayette, Gonzales and Karnes Counties, Texas. The acreage is located in the crude oil window of the Eagle Ford shale trend of south Texas and is prospective for the Eagle Ford, Austin Chalk, Upper Eagle Ford, Buda, Wilcox and Edwards formations. We serve as the operator with a range of approximately 25% to 50% undivided ownership interest in substantially all of the acreage.
 As of December 31, 2016, we operated 70 gross Eagle Ford wells and 9 gross Austin Chalk wells and had non-operated interests in two gross producing Eagle Ford wells and one gross producing Austin Chalk well. We have identified a total of approximately 140 gross Eagle Ford drilling locations in this acreage. The number of Eagle Ford locations could potentially increase subject to future down spacing initiatives and successful implementation of slickwater enhanced completions. In addition, because our acreage position is prospective for the Austin Chalk, Upper Eagle Ford, Buda, Wilcox and Edwards formations, we may have additional future economic locations. The majority of our acreage is covered by an approximately 173 square mile 3-D seismic survey, which is being used to develop the Eagle Ford and identify Austin Chalk locations and other economic opportunities.
 10


Non-Operated Eagle Ford
 We have a non-operated position in approximately 25,500 gross (2,900 net) acres in two areas within the Hawkville Field in La Salle County, Texas. The acreage is operated by BHP Billiton and Lewis Petro Properties, Inc. and is prone to natural gas and condensate produced from the Eagle Ford formation. The two areas are summarized below:

a) | White Kitchen – We have an average working interest of approximately 12% in approximately 7,100 gross acres, all of which is held by production. As of December 31, 2016, 30 gross wells were producing, and we have identified approximately 40 additional drilling locations.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b) | Martin Ranch – We have a 10% working interest in approximately 18,000 gross acres. As of December 31, 2016, 31 gross wells were producing, and we have identified approximately 140 potential drilling locations in the acreage.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Williston Basin
 We have a non-operated position in approximately 9, 300 net acres in the Williston Basin of North Dakota. At present, our most active area within the basin is the Banks Field in McKenzie County, North Dakota. In the Banks Field, we have an average working interest of approximately 3.9% in 99 gross horizontal Bakken/Three Forks producing wells that are primarily non-operated. We have an additional 13 gross wells waiting on completion in the Banks Field with an average working interest of approximately 5%. We have identified approximately 210 gross potential drilling locations which are in existing producing units throughout the Bakken/Three Forks play.
Competition
 The domestic oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive in the exploration for and acquisition of reserves and in the producing and marketing of its production. Our competitors include national oil companies, major oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas companies, drilling partnership programs, individual producers, natural gas marketers, and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies. They may be able to pay more for seismic information and lease rights on oil and natural gas properties and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties, than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate related transactions in a highly competitive environment.
Seasonality of Business
 Weather conditions often affect the demand for, and prices of, natural gas and can also delay oil and natural gas drilling activities, disrupting our overall business plans. Demand for natural gas is typically higher during the winter, resulting in higher natural gas prices for our natural gas production during our first and fourth fiscal quarters. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, our results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that we may realize on an annual basis.
Operational Risks
 Oil and natural gas exploitation, development and production involves a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. There is no assurance that we will discover, acquire or produce additional oil and natural gas in commercial quantities. Oil and natural gas operations also involve the risk that well fires, blowouts, equipment failure, human error and other events may cause accidental leakage or spills of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids or drilling fluids into the environment, or cause significant injury to persons or property. In such event, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the satisfaction of which could substantially reduce our available cash and possibly result in loss of oil and natural gas properties. Such hazards may also cause damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations, production facilities and pipeline or other processing facilities.
 As is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we do not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows. For further discussion of these risks see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.
 11


Title to Properties
 We believe that the title to our oil and natural gas properties is good and defensible in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry, subject to such exceptions which, in our opinion, are not so material as to detract substantially from the use or value of our oil and natural gas properties. Our oil and natural gas properties are typically subject, in one degree or another, to one or more of the following:

• | royalties and other burdens and obligations, express or implied, under oil and natural gas leases;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | overriding royalties and other burdens created by us or our predecessors in title;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a variety of contractual obligations (including, in some cases, development obligations) arising under operating agreements, farmout agreements, participation agreements, production sales contracts and other agreements that may affect the properties or their titles;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | back-ins and reversionary interests existing under purchase agreements and leasehold assignments;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | liens that arise in the normal course of operations, such as those for unpaid taxes, statutory liens securing obligations to unpaid suppliers and contractors and contractual liens under operating agreements; as well as pooling, unitization and communitization agreements, declarations and orders; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | easements, restrictions, rights-of-way and other matters that commonly affect property.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To the extent that such burdens and obligations affect our rights to production revenues, they have been taken into account in calculating our net revenue interests and in estimating the size and value of our reserves. We believe that the burdens and obligations affecting our oil and natural gas properties are conventional in our industry with respect to the types of properties we own.
 Regulations
 All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration, development and production activities related to oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern the size of drilling and spacing units, the density of wells that may be drilled in oil and natural gas properties and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of land and leases to facilitate exploration and/or development while other states rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of land and leases. In areas where pooling is primarily or exclusively voluntary, it may be difficult to form spacing units and therefore difficult to develop a project if the operator owns less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose specified requirements regarding the ratability of production. On some occasions, local authorities have imposed moratoria or other restrictions on exploration, development and production activities pending investigations and studies addressing potential local impacts of these activities before allowing oil and natural gas exploration, development and production to proceed.
 The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.
 Environmental Regulations
 Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency, commonly referred to as the EPA, issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures. Among other things, environmental regulatory programs typically govern the permitting, construction and operation of a well of production related facility. Many factors, including public perception, can materially impact the ability to secure an environmental construction or operation permit. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which could result in liability for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on our part.
 12


Beyond existing requirements, new programs and changes in existing programs, may address various aspects of our business including oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, air emissions, waste management, and underground injection of waste material. Environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position.
 Hazardous Substances and Wastes 
 The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons may include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances that have been released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of some health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment.
 Under the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, referred to as RCRA, most wastes generated by the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas are not regulated as hazardous waste. Periodically, however, there are proposals to lift the existing exemption for oil and natural gas wastes and reclassify them as hazardous wastes or subject them to enhanced solid waste regulation. If such proposals were to be enacted, they could have a significant impact on our operating costs and on those of all the industry in general. In the ordinary course of our operations moreover, some wastes generated in connection with our exploration, development and production activities may be regulated as solid waste under RCRA, as hazardous waste under existing RCRA regulations or as hazardous substances under CERCLA. From time to time, releases of materials or wastes have occurred at locations we own or at which we have operations. These properties and the materials or wastes released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we have been and may be required to remove or remediate such materials or wastes.
 Water Discharges
 Our operations are also subject to the federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws. Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA has adopted regulations concerning discharges of storm water runoff. This program requires covered facilities to obtain individual permits, or seek coverage under a general permit. Some of our properties may require permits for discharges of storm water runoff. We believe that we will be able to obtain, or be included under, these permits, where necessary, and make minor modifications to existing facilities and operations that would not have a material effect on us. The Clean Water Act and similar state acts regulate other discharges of wastewater, oil, and other pollutants to surface water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, wetlands, and streams. Failure to obtain permits for such discharges could result in civil and criminal penalties, orders to cease such discharges, and costs to remediate and pay natural resources damages. These laws also require the preparation and implementation of Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plans in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. In the event of a discharge of oil into U.S. waters we could be liable under the Oil Pollution Act for clean-up costs, damages and economic losses.
 Our oil and natural gas production also generates salt water, which we dispose of by underground injection. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) regulations promulgated under the SDWA and related state programs regulate the drilling and operation of salt water disposal wells. The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states, and in others it is delegated to the state for administering. Permits must be obtained before drilling salt water disposal wells, and casing integrity monitoring must be conducted periodically to ensure the casing is not leaking salt water to groundwater. Contamination of groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SDWA and state laws. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury.
 Hydraulic Fracturing
 Our completion operations are subject to regulation, which may increase in the short- or long-term. In particular, the well completion technique known as hydraulic fracturing is used to stimulate production of natural gas and oil has come under increased scrutiny by the environmental community, and many local, state and federal regulators. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure, usually down casing that is cemented in the wellbore, into prospective rock formations at depths to stimulate oil and natural gas production. We engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with substantially all of the wells for which we are the operator.
 13


Under the direction of Congress, the EPA completed a study finding that hydraulic fracturing could potentially harm drinking water resources under adverse circumstances such as injection directly into groundwater or into production wells lacking mechanical integrity. The EPA has also finalized pre-treatment standards under the Clean Water Act for wastewater discharges from shale hydraulic fracturing operations to municipal sewage treatment plants. Beyond that, several environmental groups have petitioned the EPA to extend toxic release reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act to the oil and natural gas extraction industry and to require disclosure under the Toxic Substances Control Act of chemicals used in fracturing. Congress might likewise consider legislation to amend the federal SDWA to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. Certain states, including Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, already have issued similar disclosure rules.
 In addition, the Department of the Interior has promulgated regulations concerning the use of hydraulic fracturing on lands under its jurisdiction, which includes lands on which we conduct or plan to conduct operations. States similarly have been imposing new restrictions or bans on hydraulic fracturing. Even local jurisdictions have adopted, or tried to adopt, regulations restricting hydraulic fracturing. Additional hydraulic fracturing requirements at the federal, state or local level may limit our ability to operate or increase our operating costs.
 Air Emissions
 The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources, including oil and natural gas production. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Our operations, or the operations of service companies engaged by us, may in certain circumstances and locations be subject to permits and restrictions under these statutes for emissions of air pollutants.
 In 2012 and 2016, the EPA issued air regulations for the oil and natural gas industry that address emissions from certain new sources of volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”), sulfur dioxide, air toxics and methane. The rules include the first federal air standards for oil and natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured, or refractured, as well as requirements for other processes and equipment, including storage tanks. Compliance with these regulations has imposed additional requirements and costs on our operations. The EPA also has started to consider whether to extend such regulations to existing wells.
 In October 2015, the EPA announced that it was lowering the primary national ambient air quality standards (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. Implementation will take place over several years; however, the new standard could result in a significant expansion of ozone nonattainment areas across the United States, including areas in which we operate. Oil and natural gas operations in ozone nonattainment areas would likely be subject to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements, and increased permitting delays and costs.
 Climate Change
 Studies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere. In response to these studies, governments have been adopting domestic and international climate change regulations that require reporting and reductions of the emission of such greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, are considered greenhouse gases. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement address greenhouse gas emissions, and several countries including those comprising the European Union, have established greenhouse gas regulatory systems. In the United States, at the state level, many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have been implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through emission inventories, emissions targets, greenhouse gas cap and trade programs or incentives for renewable energy generation, while others have considered adopting such greenhouse gas programs.
 At the federal level, the EPA has issued regulations requiring us and other companies to annually report certain greenhouse gas emissions from our oil and natural gas facilities. Beyond its measuring and reporting rules, the EPA has issued an “Endangerment Finding” under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The finding served as the first step to issuing regulations that require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities. 
 In addition, the Obama Administration developed a Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions that was intended to result by 2025 in a 40-45% decrease in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry as compared to 2012 levels. Consistent with that strategy, the EPA issued its air rules for oil and natural gas production sources, and the federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) promulgated standards for reducing venting and flaring on public lands.
 14


Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur additional operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems or other compliance costs, and reduce demand for our products.
 The National Environmental Policy Act
 Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. This process has the potential to delay the development of future oil and natural gas projects.
 Threatened and endangered species, migratory birds and natural resources
 Various federal and state statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Clean Water Act. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions on federal land use or on private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Where takings of or harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat, or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties may act to prevent or restrict oil and natural gas exploration activities or seek damages for any injury, whether resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and in some cases, criminal penalties may result. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to make a determination on listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by no later than completion of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The federal government in the past has issued indictments under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to several oil and natural gas companies after dead migratory birds were found near reserve pits associated with drilling activities. The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our development activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our oil and natural gas reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases. 
 Hazard communications and community right to know
 We are subject to federal and state hazard communication and community right to know statutes and regulations. These regulations govern record keeping and reporting of the use and release of hazardous substances, including, but not limited to, the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and may require that information be provided to state and local government authorities, as well as the public.
 Occupational Safety and Health Act
