Item 1. | Business

Overview
Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc. was incorporated on May 24, 1999 in the state of Delaware and began its principal operations in November 1999. Unless the context requires otherwise, the words “Cornerstone,” “we,” “Company,” “us” and “our” refer to Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Cornerstone is a leading global provider of learning and human capital management software, delivered as Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”). We are one of the world’s largest cloud computing companies with approximately 35.3 million users across 3,250 clients in 192 countries and 43 different languages. We help organizations around the globe recruit, train and manage their employees.
Our human capital management platform combines the world’s leading unified talent management solutions with state-of-the-art analytics and HR administration solutions to enable organizations to manage the entire employee lifecycle. Our focus on continuous learning and development helps organizations to empower employees to realize their potential and drive success.
We work with clients across all geographies, verticals and market segments. Our clients include multi-national corporations, large domestic and foreign-based enterprises, mid-market companies, public sector organizations, healthcare providers, higher education institutions, non-profit organizations and small businesses. We sell our platform domestically and internationally through both direct and indirect channels, including direct sales teams throughout North and South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific and distributor relationships with payroll companies, human resource consultancies and global system integrators.
Our enterprise human capital management platform is composed of four product suites:

• | Our Recruiting suite helps organizations to source and attract candidates, assess and select applicants, onboard new hires and manage the entire recruiting process;


• | Our Learning suite enables clients to manage training and development programs, knowledge sharing and collaboration among employees, track compliance requirements and support career development for employees. Our content offering delivers fresh, modern content, fueling employee curiosity and inspiring growth;


• | Our Performance suite provides tools to manage goal setting, performance reviews, competency assessments, development plans, continuous feedback, compensation management and succession planning; and


• | Our HR Administration suite supports employee records administration, organizational management, employee and manager self-service, workforce planning and compliance reporting.

4

Our clients can supplement the product suites with our state-of-the-art analytics capabilities to make more-informed decisions using data from across the platform for talent mobility, engagement and development so that HR and leadership can focus on strategic initiatives to help their organization succeed. 
In addition to our enterprise human capital management platform, we offer PiiQ, formerly known as Cornerstone Growth Edition, which is a cloud-based talent management solution with learning and performance product offerings targeted to organizations with 500 or fewer employees. 
Our Client Success team supports our clients’ ongoing optimization of their talent processes and use of our platform. In addition, our Cornerstone Edge solutions allow our clients and partners to more easily integrate with a growing marketplace of service providers. After the initial purchase of our platform, we continue to market and sell to our existing clients, who may renew their subscriptions, add additional products, broaden the deployment of the platform across their organizations and increase usage of the platform over time. 
We have grown our business each of the last 16 years. Our revenue has grown to $482.0 million in 2017 from $423.1 million in 2016 and from $339.7 million in 2015. We have averaged an annual dollar retention rate of approximately 95% since 2002 and our annual recurring revenue as of December 31, 2017 was $439.0 million, as described in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” under the heading “Metrics”, which includes a detailed description of these metrics. 
The Market
Human capital is both a major asset and expense for all organizations. Based on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data as of September 2017, total compensation paid to the United States civilian workforce of approximately 161.1 million people was expected to exceed $11.9 trillion in 2017.
Accordingly, organizations have long sought to optimize their investments in human capital. We believe that organizations face seven major challenges in maximizing the productivity of their internal and external human capital:

• | Acquiring Talent. Increasingly seeking to fill open positions by recruiting internally and by leveraging the external networks of their employees, corporate recruiting has evolved from a process that was principally driven by traditional sources such as inbound resume submissions and job board postings to one that is inherently social in nature.


• | Developing Talent. Effectively orienting new hires and developing employees throughout their careers to achieve their full potential, which has become more difficult with the Millennial generation entering the workforce. Additionally, increasingly distributed workforces and heightened compliance requirements have made training requirements even more important.


• | Engaging Employees. Connecting with employees at all levels and locations of the organization to keep them motivated, working together and innovating, has become more difficult with the rise of globalization and telecommuting.


• | Improving Business Execution. Ensuring the effective alignment of employee behavior with the organization’s objectives through goal management and employee assessment and development, as well as by linking compensation to performance.


• | Building a Leadership Pipeline. Identifying, preparing and retaining individuals for leadership positions at all levels and across all parts of the organization, which has become an acute challenge with the growing mobility and turnover of employees and the impending retirements of the Baby Boomers.


• | Integrating with the Extended Enterprise of Customers, Vendors and Distributors. Delivering training, certification programs and resources to the organization’s network of customers, vendors, distributors and other third parties that constitute the organization’s extended enterprise, which has become more difficult with the rise of outsourcing and increasing globalization.


• | Modernizing HR Data Management. Enterprise organizations are forced to either sustain many disparate, outdated HR systems across multiple sites and countries, or choose to replace those systems with a global core HR solution, which can be very costly, risky and take years to implement. Also, many mid-market organizations have outgrown their use of spreadsheets to manage people data, but do not need the complexities of a core HR solution.

We believe that just as organizations are increasingly choosing SaaS solutions for business applications such as sales force management, they are also increasingly adopting SaaS human capital management solutions. We also believe many of the existing solutions suffer from one or more of the following shortcomings:

• | Narrow Functionality. As they only address specific stages of the employee lifecycle, many solutions lack sufficient breadth of functionality to maximize employee productivity effectively.

5


• | Limited Configurability. Most solutions are rigid and limit the ability of organizations to match their diverse workflows or to adopt their desired talent management practices.


• | Difficult to Use. Inputting, updating, analyzing and sharing information is often cumbersome, resulting in low employee adoption and usage.


• | Costly to Deploy, Maintain and Upgrade. Hosted or on-premise solutions require significant expense and time to deploy as well as require ongoing costs associated with IT support, network infrastructure, maintenance and upgrades.


• | Inability to Scale. Many solutions are designed to support the needs of smaller organizations and have difficulty meeting the complex functional requirements or the sizeable infrastructure demands of larger enterprises.

Given the limitations of existing offerings, we believe there is a market opportunity for a comprehensive, unified solution that helps organizations manage all aspects of their internal and external human capital and link human capital management to their business strategy.
The Cornerstone OnDemand Answer
Our human capital management platform is a comprehensive SaaS solution that consists of suites to help organizations manage their recruiting, learning, performance and HR administration processes. These suites are supplemented by state-of-the-art analytics and reporting as well as a number of cross-product tools for employee profile management and e-learning content aggregation and delivery. We also provide professional services for configuration, integration, training and optimization of our platform. We believe that our human capital management platform delivers the following benefits:

• | Comprehensive Functionality. Our platform provides a comprehensive approach to human capital management by offering products to address all stages of the employee lifecycle: recruiting, onboarding, learning, performance, succession, compensation, enterprise social collaboration and HR administration processes. Employees use our platform throughout their careers to engage in performance processes such as goal management, performance reviews, continuous feedback, competency assessments and compensatory reviews; to complete job-specific and compliance-related training; to evaluate potential career changes, development plans or succession processes; and to connect and collaborate with co-workers by leveraging enterprise social networking tools. Employee managers and HR managers use our platform to perform their human capital administrative responsibilities effectively throughout the employees’ careers.

Our clients can manage processes that span different human capital management functions because our product offerings are unified. For example, our clients can automatically identify skill gaps as part of an employee’s performance review, assign training to address those gaps and monitor the results of that training. Also, clients can identify high potential employees for future leadership positions and place them in executive development programs.
We believe our comprehensive, unified platform allows our clients to align their human capital management processes and practices with their broader strategic goals.

• | Flexible and Highly Configurable. Our platform offers substantial configurability that allows our clients to match the use of our software with most of their specific business processes and workflows. Our clients can configure various features, functions and work flows in our platform by business unit, division, department, region, location, job position, pay grade, cost center, or self-defined organizational unit. Our clients are able to adjust features to configure specific processes, such as performance review workflows or training approvals, to match their existing or desired practices. This high level of configurability means that custom coding projects generally are not required to meet the diverse needs of our clients.

Our clients can deploy the product offerings individually or in any combination. As a result, our clients have the flexibility to purchase solely those products that solve their immediate human capital management needs and can incrementally deploy additional products in the future as their needs evolve.

• | Easy-to-Use, Personalized User Interface. Our platform employs an intuitive user interface and may be personalized for the end user, typically based on position, division, pay grade, location, manager and particular use of the solution. This ease of use limits the need for end-user training, which we believe increases user adoption rates and usage. While we typically train administrators, most clients do not need training on using our products.


• | Software-as-a-Service Solution Lowers the Total Cost of Ownership and Speeds Delivery. Our platform is accessible through a standard web browser and does not require the large investments in implementation time, personnel, hardware and consulting that are typical of hosted or on-premise solutions. With a single code base to maintain, we are able to release improved functionality on a quarterly basis. This is a more rapid pace than most hosted or on-premise solution providers can afford to deliver.

6


• | Scalable to Meet the Needs of Organizations. Our platform has been used by Fortune 100 companies since 2001. While the complex needs of these global corporations required us to build a solution that can scale to support large, geographically-distributed employee bases, our platform is capable of supporting deployments of various sizes. Today we service 36 multi-national corporations with over 150,000 active users each. Our largest deployment is for over 600,000 users.


• | Continued Innovation through Collaborative Product Development. We work collaboratively with our clients on an ongoing basis to develop almost every part of our platform. The vast majority of our thousands of software features were designed with existing and prospective clients based on their specific functional requests.

Our Strategy
Our goal is to empower people, organizations and communities to realize their potential with our comprehensive human capital management platform. Key elements of our strategy include:
Retain and Expand Business with Existing Clients. We believe our existing installed base of clients offers a substantial opportunity for growth.

• | Focus on Client Success, Retention and Growth. We believe focusing on our clients’ success will lead to our own success. We have developed a Client Success Framework that governs our operational model. Since 2002, we have had an average annual dollar retention rate of approximately 95%. We strive to maintain our strong retention rates by continuing to provide our clients with high levels of service, support and increasing functionality.


• | Sell Additional Products to Existing Clients. We believe there is a significant growth opportunity in selling additional functionality to our existing clients. Many clients have added functionality subsequent to their initial deployments as they recognize the benefits of our unified platform, and as a result, approximately 69% of our clients today utilize two or more products and approximately 40% utilize three or more products. With our expanding product portfolio, such as our newest product Cornerstone HR, we believe significant upsell opportunity remains within our existing client base.

Strengthen Current Sales Channels. We intend to increase our investments in both direct and indirect sales channels to acquire new clients.

• | Invest in Direct Sales in North America. We believe that the market for human capital management is large and remains significantly underpenetrated.


• | Expand and Strengthen Our Alliances. We intend to grow our distribution channels through key business alliances, including agreements with global vendors.


• | Significantly Grow Our International Operation. We believe a substantial opportunity exists to continue to grow sales of our platform internationally. We intend to grow our Europe, Middle-East and Africa ("EMEA") and Asia-Pacific and Japan ("APJ") operations, which provide for direct sales, alliances, services and support in the regions. We have grown our EMEA client base from one client at December 31, 2007 to 698 clients at December 31, 2017 and our APJ client base from two clients at December 31, 2009 to 173 clients at December 31, 2017.

Continue to Innovate and Extend Our Technological Leadership. We believe we have developed over the last decade a deep understanding of the human capital management challenges our clients face. We continually collaborate with our clients to build extensive functionality that addresses their specific needs and requests. We plan to continue to leverage our expertise in human capital management and client relationships to develop new products, features and functionality which will enhance our platform and expand our addressable market.
Make Cornerstone Built to Last. Our growth strategy since inception has been deliberate, disciplined and focused on long-term success. This has allowed us to weather periods of economic turmoil and significant changes in the markets we serve without experiencing business contraction. We plan to continue with the same systematic approach in the future.
Acquisitions. In the future, we may seek to acquire or invest in additional businesses, products or technologies that we believe will complement or expand our platform, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities.
Execute Our Renewed Strategic Focus. Following a strategic review process undertaken by our board of directors during 2017, the board determined that the optimal way to maximize shareholder value is to execute a plan to transform our operations and support that plan with a capital infusion and new strategic partnerships. As a result, we entered into an agreement with Silver Lake, one of the world's leading technology private equity investors, and LinkedIn, under which Silver Lake and LinkedIn invested $300.0 million in Cornerstone in the form of convertible senior notes. In November 2017, we announced our strategic plan with the objective of better positioning us for long-term growth and increasing shareholder value. In connection with the plan, we will (i) sharpen our focus on recurring revenue growth; (ii) drive operating margin and free cash flow improvement; (iii) develop new recurring revenue streams, including e-learning content subscriptions; (iv) bolster our leadership team; and (v) strengthen our governance to help us best execute on this strategic transformation.
Strategic Relationships and Professional Services
We have entered into alliance agreements in order to expand our capabilities and geographic presence and provide our clients with access to specific types of content. We have entered into relationships with various third-party consulting firms to assist in the successful implementation of our platform and to optimize our clients’ use of our platform during the terms of their engagements. Our clients utilize these firms to assist in delivery of implementation and integration services amongst other consulting services. As our business grows, we expect to continue to utilize increasing amounts of these services. As part of our renewed strategic focus, we are taking steps to migrate much of our implementation services to our global partners. To effect the migration, we are augmenting our partner operations and delivery assurance functions while reducing overall headcount in our service delivery division, as partners take on the majority of our professional services work. This aligns with our focus on growing recurring revenue.
With our SaaS model, we have eliminated the need for lengthy and complex technology integrations, such as customizing software code, deploying equipment or maintaining unique delivery models or hardware infrastructure for individual clients. As a result, we typically deploy our human capital management platform in significantly less time than required for similar deployments of hosted or on-premise software. Our professional services include implementation services, integration services, content services, business consulting services, training services as well as ongoing support and advice.
Outsourcing and Distribution Relationships
We have developed a network of outsourcing, distribution and referral relationships to expand our reach and provide product and services sales through indirect channels. We expect to continue to add distributors to build our sales presence in certain geographic and vertical markets.
Consulting and Services Relationships
We have entered into alliance relationships with HR consulting firms to deliver consulting services, such as implementation and content development services, to clients.
Content and Product Relationships
We have entered into distributor agreements with a wide range of vendors which provide off-the-shelf e-learning content and custom learning content development services. Through this network, we are able to offer an extensive library of online training content to our clients through our Learning Experience Platform. Our content distributors for e-learning content include industry leaders as well as regional and vertically-focused online training providers. In addition, we have agreements with providers of specific competency models for use by our clients directly in our human capital management platform.

Global Client Success
We are dedicated to the success of our clients. We have developed a Client Success Framework which governs our operational model, the structure of our Client Management teams and the types of services necessary at each stage of a client’s lifecycle.
Within this framework, we have developed the following roles with primary responsibility to our clients at various levels of their organizations:

• | Client Executives who interact with executive-level sponsors and human resources executives at a client and are focused on the overall relationship, sales to existing clients and client business concerns;


• | Client Success Managers who work directly with executive-level sponsors and human resources executives at our clients to maximize the value of their investment in our human capital management platform; and


• | Product Specialists who interact with client administrators and are focused on features and functions of our human capital management platform.

We believe this life cycle driven approach to client support and client success has contributed directly to our high client retention rate and high rankings for client satisfaction in independent research studies.
We offer support in multiple languages, at multiple levels and through multiple channels, including global support coverage available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We use our own enterprise social collaboration product to provide our clients and distributors with a virtual community to collaborate on product design, release management and best practices.
We monitor client satisfaction internally as part of formalized programs and at regular intervals during the client lifecycle, including during the transition from sales to implementation, at the completion of a consulting project and daily based on interactions with our client-facing teams.
Our Customers
As of December 31, 2017, 3,250 clients used our human capital management platform with approximately 35.3 million registered users across 192 countries and 43 languages. Our clients represent a variety of different industries, including automotive, business services, education and publishing, financial services, food and restaurants, healthcare, insurance, media and communications, non-profits, pharmaceuticals, public sector, retail, technology and travel. No single client accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue in 2017, 2016 or 2015. 
Technology, Operations and Research and Development
Technology
Our human capital management platform is designed with an on-demand architecture which our clients access via a standard web browser. It uses a single code base, with all of our clients running on the current version of our software and has been specifically built to deliver:

• | a consistent, intuitive end-user experience to limit the need for product training and to encourage high levels of end-user adoption and engagement;


• | modularity and flexibility, by allowing our clients to activate and implement virtually any combination of the features we offer;


• | high levels of configurability to enable our clients to mimic their existing business processes, workflows and organizational hierarchies within our platform;


• | web services to facilitate the importing and exporting of data to and from other client systems, such as enterprise resource planning and human resource information system platforms;


• | scalability to match the needs of the largest global enterprises and to meet future client growth; and


• | rigorous security standards and high levels of system performance and availability demanded by our clients.

Our human capital management platform offers a localized user interface and currency conversion capabilities. It is currently available in the following 43 languages: Arabic, Armenian, Bahasa (Malaysia), Bulgarian, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional (Hong Kong), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (Australia), English (UK), English (US), Estonian, Finnish, French (Canada), French (France), German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovakian, Slovenian, Spanish (Latin America), Spanish (Spain), Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese.

Our human capital management platform is deployed using a multi-tenant and multi-user architecture. We employ a modularized architecture to balance the load of clients on separate sub-environments, as well as to provide a flexible method for scalability without impacting other parts of the current environment. This architecture allows us to provide the high levels of uptime required by our clients. Our existing infrastructure has been designed with sufficient capacity to meet our current and estimated near term future needs. Global uptime in 2017 was 99.995%.
Security is of paramount importance to us due to the sensitive nature of employee data. We have designed our human capital management platform to meet certain rigorous industry security standards and to help assure clients that their sensitive data is protected across the system. We ensure high levels of security by logically segregating each client’s data from the data of other clients and by enforcing a consistent approach to roles and rights within the system. These restrictions limit system access to only those individuals authorized by our clients. We also employ multiple standard technologies, protocols and processes to monitor, test and certify the security of our infrastructure continuously, including automated scans, periodic security audits and penetration tests conducted by our clients and commissioned by us from third parties.
We utilize a variety of industry standard technologies including Microsoft .NET and Hadoop and write the majority of our software in programming languages, such as C# and Java. We use Web 2.0 technologies, such as Javascript and React, extensively to enhance the usability, performance and overall user experience of our human capital management platform. Microsoft SQL Server is our primary relational database management system, but other database technologies are in use as well, including NoSQL databases. Apart from these and other third-party components, our entire human capital management platform has been specifically built and upgraded by our in-house development team. 
Operations
We physically host our human capital management platform for our clients in two secure third-party data center facilities, one located in El Segundo, California and the other located near London, United Kingdom. Both facilities are leased from Equinix, Inc. These facilities provide physical security, including manned security 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, biometric access controls and systems security, redundant power and environmental controls. Additionally, we are in the process of building data centers in Paris, France and Frankfurt, Germany. 
We lease space for disaster recovery purposes from Equinix in Virginia, United States and in Manchester, United Kingdom. In addition, we have started building out services and functionality on Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) with a view to migrating more software to AWS over time. We maintain the same or higher standards of security and compliance at AWS as we do in our leased facilities.
Our infrastructure includes firewalls, switches, routers, load balancers and IDS/IPS from Palo Alto Networks, Cisco Systems, A10 Networks and other widely commercially available vendors to provide the networking infrastructure and high levels of security for the environment. We use industry standard blade and rack-mounted servers to run our human capital management platform and Akamai Technologies’ Global Network of Edge Servers for content caching. We use solid state storage and other storage technologies from leading vendors such as SanDisk, Pure Storage and NetApp.
Research and Development
The responsibilities of our research and development organization include product management, product development and quality assurance. Our research and development organization is global, with major centers in our Santa Monica, California headquarters as well as in Sunnyvale, California; Tel Aviv, Israel; Auckland, New Zealand; and Bangalore, India. Our Agile development methodology, in combination with our SaaS delivery model, allows us to release new and enhanced software features on a regular and predictable basis, currently quarterly. We follow a well-defined communications protocol to support our clients with release management. We patch our software on a bi-weekly basis or as needed. Based on feedback from our clients and prospects and pursuant to our own innovation, we continuously develop new functionality while enhancing and maintaining our existing product offerings. We do not need to maintain multiple engineering teams to support different versions of the code because all of our clients are running on the current version of our product offerings.
Our research and development expenses were $62.0 million in 2017, $47.0 million in 2016 and $41.0 million in 2015. Our research and development expenses plus capitalized software were $82.5 million in 2017, $63.4 million in 2016 and $54.3 million in 2015.

We also maintain a separate team of client executives responsible for renewals and up-sales to existing clients, as described above.
Marketing
We manage global demand generation programs, develop sales pipelines and enhance brand awareness through our marketing initiatives. Our marketing programs target HR executives, technology professionals and senior business leaders. Our principal marketing initiatives include:

• | Demand Generation. Our demand generation activities include lead generation through email and direct mail campaigns, participation in industry events, securing event speaking opportunities and online marketing, including both SEM and organic SEO online marketing.


• | Corporate Marketing. We market to our clients by leveraging product marketing, client success stories, thought leadership content and brand awareness advertising campaigns. Additionally, we host regional client user group meetings and we also co-market with our strategic distributors, including joint press announcements and demand generation activities.


• | Marketing Communications. We undertake media relations, corporate communications, industry analyst relations activities, client advocacy and social media outreach.

Competition
The market for human capital management software is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented. This market is subject to changing technology, shifting client needs and frequent introductions of new products and services.
Most of our sales efforts are competitive, often involving requests for proposals. We compete primarily on the basis of providing a comprehensive, fully unified platform for human capital management as opposed to specific service offerings.

In the applicant tracking systems segment, which the recruiting and onboarding product offerings each serve, our principal competitors include companies such as Oracle Corporation, International Business Machines Corporation and Lumesse. In the learning management systems segment, which the learning and extended enterprise product offerings each serve, our principal competitors include companies such as Oracle Corporation, Saba Software, Inc., SAP America, Inc. and SkillSoft Corp. In the performance management systems segment, which the performance, succession and compensation product offerings each serve, our principal competitors include companies such as Saba Software, Inc., Talentsoft, Oracle Corporation, Peoplefluent, Inc. and SAP America, Inc. These vendors are, like us, largely SaaS providers. We compete in these segments primarily on the basis of:

• | the level of integration of our product offerings within our human capital management platform;


• | the breath and depth of our product functionality;


• | the flexibility and configurability of our product offerings to meet the changing content and workflow requirements of our clients’ business units;


• | the quality of our service and focus on client success;


• | our ability to provide scalability and flexibility for large and complex global deployments; and


• | the ease of use of our product offerings and overall user experience.

In addition, we occasionally compete with custom-built software that is designed to support the needs of a single organization, as well as with third-party talent and human resource application providers that focus on specific aspects of human capital management.
Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets than we do. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed” and “Risk Factors—Mergers of or other strategic transactions by our competitors could weaken our competitive position or reduce our revenue.”
Government Contracts
Many of our contracts with government agencies are subject to termination at the election of the government agency. While our government contracts generally do not provide for renegotiation of fees at the election of the Government, it is possible that the government agency could request, and that we could under certain circumstances agree to, the renegotiation of the payments otherwise payable under such contracts. However, we have not in the past renegotiated significant payment terms under our government contracts. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—We face risks associated with our sales to governmental entities.”
Proprietary Rights
To safeguard our proprietary and intellectual property rights, we rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws in the United States and in other jurisdictions and on contractual restrictions. Our key assets include our software code and associated proprietary and intellectual property rights, in particular the trade secrets and know-how associated with our human capital management platform which we developed internally over the years. We were issued a patent for our software in 2003 which expires in 2021; we have since filed for additional patent protection, we own registered trademarks and we will continue to evaluate the need for additional patents and trademarks. We have confidentiality and license agreements with employees, contractors, clients, distributors and other third parties, which limit access to and use of our proprietary information and software.
Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees, creation of new suites, features and functionality, collaboration with our clients and frequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
Despite our efforts to preserve and protect our proprietary and intellectual property rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer, or otherwise obtain portions of our product. Competitors may attempt to develop similar products that could compete in the same market as our products. Unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information by our employees or third parties could occur. Laws of other jurisdictions may not protect our proprietary and intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or disclosure in the same manner as the United States. The risk of unauthorized uses of our proprietary and intellectual property rights may increase as we continue to expand outside of the United States.

Third-party infringement claims are also possible in our industry, especially as software functionality and features expand, evolve and overlap with other industry segments. Current and future competitors, as well as non-practicing patent holders, could claim at any time that some or all of our software infringes on patents they now hold or might obtain or be issued in the future.
Seasonality
Our sales are seasonal in nature. We sign a higher percentage of agreements with new clients, as well as renewal agreements with existing clients, in the fourth quarter of each year. In addition, within a given quarter, we sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of that quarter. We believe this seasonality is driven by several factors, most notably the tendency of our clients’ procurement departments to purchase technology at the end of a quarter or calendar year, possibly in order to use up their available quarterly or annual funding allocations. As the terms of most of our client agreements are measured in full year increments, agreements regardless of when executed, will generally come up for renewal at that same time in subsequent years.
Business Segment and Geographical Information
We operate in a single operating segment. For geographic financial information, see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Working Capital Practices
Information about our working capital practices is included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and is incorporated herein by reference.
Employees
At December 31, 2017, we had 1,891 employees, which is a 4% increase from 1,823 employees at December 31, 2016. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage. We consider our relations with our employees to be strong. Internally, we strive to empower our people by using our human capital management platform to on-board, develop, connect, align, assess, retain, promote and manage the HR administration of our own employees.
The Cornerstone OnDemand Foundation
To demonstrate our commitment to empowering people and communities, we helped form the Cornerstone OnDemand Foundation, or the Foundation, in 2010. The Foundation seeks to empower communities in the United States and internationally by increasing the impact of the non-profit sector through the utilization of our human capital management platform and capacity building programs.
The Foundation focuses its efforts on the areas of education, workforce development and disaster relief. We have enlisted the help of our employees, clients and distributors to support the Foundation in its efforts. The Foundation is designed to be self-sustaining over time through a variety of ongoing funding streams, such as donations, sponsorships and distribution fees.
