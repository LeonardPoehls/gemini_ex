     Overview of Our Company 
     We are a commercial-stage medical technology company pioneering the use of advanced photonics to provide surgeons with improved direct visualization of surgical cavities during minimally invasive and minimal access surgical procedures. We integrate our Intelligent Photonics™ technology platform into our single-use and reusable advanced surgical devices to address some of the critical intracavity illumination and visualization challenges facing surgeons today. We utilize this proprietary technology to develop optical waveguides that direct and shape thermally cool, brilliant light into broad, uniform and volumetric illumination of the surgical target. We believe that improving a surgeon’s ability to see critical anatomical structures can lead to better clinical and aesthetic outcomes, improved patient safety and reduced surgical time and healthcare costs. We sold our devices to approximately 745 hospitals in the fourth quarter of 2016, as compared to approximately 530 hospitals in the same quarter of 2015. Based on the number of single-use units we have shipped as of December 31, 2016, we estimate that our devices have been used in approximately 240,000 surgical procedures. We are also using our advanced photonics technology to develop new devices and modalities to broaden the application and adoption of minimal access procedures and enable new advanced surgical techniques. Notably, in September 2016, we received U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, 510(k) clearance of PhotonBlade, a dynamic precision illuminator with enhanced energy delivery. The PhotonBlade is a first-of-its-kind device, delivering directed, thermally cool illumination at the precise point of surgical treatment in conjunction with a novel energy platform allowing for precise tissue cutting and coagulation with minimal tissue damage. As such, PhotonBlade represents a new category of Intelligent Photonics™ and strategically expands our current product portfolio. The PhotonBlade is anticipated to become commercially available in 2017.
     Photonics is the science and technological applications of light. We have applied advanced principles of photonics to develop our Intelligent Photonics technology platform, which enables the transmission, management and manipulation of light in surgical procedures. Our initial application of this technology is integrated into our family of proprietary optical waveguides. Our waveguides are sophisticated devices that rely on the principles of optics to shape and direct light. They are coupled to a modified fiber optic cable and are designed to work with the standard xenon or light-emitting diode, or LED, light sources typically found and utilized in the operating room. Our optical waveguides are incorporated into surgical devices, including our customized line of illuminated surgical retractors, handheld illuminated aspiration devices, drop-in intracavity illuminators and, most recently, PhotonBlade. Our handheld illuminated aspiration devices, drop-in intracavity illuminator, and PhotonBlade are single-use products. Our retractors are reusable, but utilize a single-use optical waveguide with each procedure.

     The fundamental attributes of our optical waveguides include a solid core optical-grade polymer, total internal reflection of light waves, light mixing and extraction by a complex geometry of refractive microstructures or microlenses. The solid core optical-grade polymer waveguide is coupled to a fiber optic cable in order to facilitate the efficient transfer of light. This unique coupling results in our waveguides capturing maximum light with minimal heat build-up. Our waveguides use critical angles and the properties of total internal reflection to retain and transmit maximum light as it travels through the device. In addition, each waveguide utilizes various novel optical methods to mix light during the total internal reflection transmission process to enable more uniform light extraction across its output surface. The output surface consists of a complex geometry of refractive microstructures or microlenses that extract, direct and shape volumetric illumination into the surgical cavity while virtually eliminating shadows and glare. This complex geometric structure extracts and directs light at numerous different angles to enable illumination of the surgical target, even if blood or debris accumulates on the surface of the waveguide. The uniform distribution of light extraction from the microstructures or microlenses throughout the entire output surface of the waveguide, as well as the proprietary solid core optical-grade polymer and patented design of our waveguides, results in thermally cool illumination.
     Advances in medical technology have resulted in growing adoption of minimally invasive and minimal access surgical procedures. Minimally invasive surgery refers to surgeries performed through one or more small incisions, which offer several benefits over traditional invasive open surgery, such as fewer surgical target complications and infections, overall reduced trauma to the anatomy, less bleeding, shorter hospitalization time, less postoperative pain, faster recovery time and improved aesthetic outcomes. Some minimally invasive procedures, such as endoscopic, laparoscopic and arthroscopic procedures, use small tubes, tiny cameras and surgical instruments to access, visualize and perform the surgery. Other procedures also use smaller incisions than conventional open surgery, but still provide the surgeon with direct visualization of the surgical target and the ability to use traditional surgical instruments. We refer to these procedures as minimal access procedures. We estimate that approximately 40% of all surgical procedures in the United States are open or minimal access, representing a sizable clinical and commercial opportunity. We are targeting our sales and marketing efforts to surgeons for the following women’s health clinical applications: breast cancer and breast reconstruction surgery, gynecology and thyroid surgery. Additional applications include procedures for electrophysiology, spine, orthopedic, cardiothoracic, and general surgery. Furthermore, our current illuminated surgical devices have a broader indication for use and can be marketed to other specialties with limited or no additional regulatory clearance. We currently estimate the annual total addressable market for our devices in these surgical specialties in the United States to be approximately $2.0 billion, based on the estimate of our average revenue per procedure.
     In the last several years, we have transitioned from a focus on research and development to the commercialization of our device portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, we market nine families of illuminated surgical devices, consisting of over 40 devices. Our goal is to be the global leader in providing advanced photonics systems to surgeons across a broad array of surgical specialties, improving surgical precision and efficiency while improving patient safety. We market and sell our devices in the United States primarily through a direct sales force, which has grown from 59 as of December 31, 2015, to 67 as of December 31, 2016. We believe this expansion will allow us to further penetrate and grow our market by demonstrating the benefits of our devices to additional surgeons, surgical specialties, and hospitals and expect to expand sales to Europe and other regions, both directly and through distributors over time. 
     Our Market Opportunity
     Advances in medical technology have resulted in growing adoption of minimal access surgical procedures. The increased utilization of these procedures by surgeons is primarily driven by their significant benefits compared to conventional open surgery including:
· | smaller incisions resulting in less scarring and fewer complications;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | less trauma to the organs, muscles, nerves, and tissue;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | less bleeding and reduced need for blood transfusions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | fewer surgical infections;
--+---------------------------


· | shortened hospital stays, potentially reducing hospital costs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

· | less postoperative pain and reduced need for associated narcotics;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | faster recovery time; and
--+--------------------------


· | improved aesthetic outcomes.
--+-----------------------------

      Though some minimally invasive procedures, such as endoscopic, laparoscopic and arthroscopic procedures, have several of the benefits described above, surgeons are only able to view the surgical target through a tiny camera, which can cause reduced depth perception and field of vision, diminished hand-eye coordination, limited mobility of the surgical instruments, and reduced tactile feedback. These limitations can increase the cognitive and physical load on the surgeon and, consequently, increase the possibility of surgical error. We believe that minimal access procedures provide many of the benefits described above. However, the small incisions used in these procedures inherently reduce a surgeon’s ability to directly see the surgical target, particularly deep within the surgical cavity, which can impact surgical precision, procedural efficiency and patient safety.
     Traditional Illumination Devices and Their Limitations 
     Lighting is a critical element of every open surgical procedure. Traditional surgical lighting options in the operating room include overhead lighting systems, surgical headlights and on-field fiber optic lighting systems. The most common illumination method in the operating room setting today is overhead lighting systems. When used in open and minimal access procedures, overhead lighting systems can present numerous challenges. It can be difficult to maintain the required direct path of illumination given changes of patient and surgeon positioning.  Adjustments to the lighting position may be required which may inconvenience the surgeon, disrupt the surgical flow, increase operating procedure time, and increase risk of contamination given that overhead lighting systems are not sterile. Moreover, overhead lighting systems may be inadequate for surgery in deeper cavities due to the creation of shadows and the inability of the light to reach the depth of the incision.  
     Surgical headlights overcome some of the shortcomings of overhead lighting systems by bringing the light source closer to the surgical cavity, eliminating shadows caused by the surgeons head, and reducing the need to adjust the overhead lighting system. Despite these benefits, we believe headlights still present limitations.  Use of headlights can cause head, neck and shoulder fatigue from the prolonged improper posture during their use. Because the source of light is still above the surgical cavity, we believe the use of headlights can create shadows and glare caused by hands, instruments and anatomy, which may limit visualization in deep surgical cavities. Headlights can also generate considerable amounts of heat during use, which can further limit comfort and can cause burns if an operator accidently mishandles the device.  
     Due to the limitations of overhead lighting systems and surgical headlights, on-field fiber optic lighting systems have been developed in an effort to provide intracavity lighting of the surgical field. On-field fiber optic lighting systems consist of a fiber optic cable attached to a fiber optic retractor. While traditional on-field fiber optic lighting systems can be effective at bringing the light source closer to the surgical field, we believe they also have inherent limitations and risks. Traditional on-field fiber optic lighting systems represent a thermal hazard in the operating room, creating the risk of burns to patients, surgeons and hospital staff, and operating room fires. The light generated by the xenon or LED light source is extremely powerful and can create temperatures exceeding 100°C. Thermal heat builds up whenever light is obstructed.  We believe another limitation of traditional on-field fiber optic lighting systems is the potential for hot spots and glare. The general light output shape emanating from a fiber optic cable that resembles a cone and is circular, with a common center around the mechanical axis of the fiber bundle. Since this bright, narrow outlet of light exits the fiber in a straight line in the direction and orientation of the fiber, the light may be reflected back in the same direction, and can create glare in the line of vision of the surgeon. In an attempt to minimize this glare, the surgeon may be required to constantly reposition the fiber optic retractor during the procedure.
     Market Need for Advanced Intracavity Illumination and Visualization Devices
     Given the limitations of traditional surgical lighting options in the operating room, we believe there is a significant opportunity to enhance intracavity illumination and visualization during open and minimal access procedures. In addition, we believe that an advanced illumination and visualization technology could broaden the application and adoption of less invasive surgical techniques.

 Our Solution
     We utilize our Intelligent Photonics technology platform to develop surgical devices designed to overcome the significant limitations of traditional surgical lighting options in the operating room. Based on surgeon feedback, surgeon observation and bench testing, we believe our technology may provide the following benefits:
· | Enhanced illumination and visualization of the surgical field. Our devices are designed to provide enhanced intracavity illumination and visualization of the surgical field during open and minimal access surgeries. The proprietary complex geometry of refractive microstructures or microlenses along the surface of our optical waveguides allow for the extraction of light in a manner that distributes light at different angles in a broad, uniform and volumetric pattern that is intended to reduce shadows, glare and excessive heat that are commonly associated with traditional surgical lighting options. In bench testing comparing light distribution and thermal profile of our Eikon retractor to a traditional fiber optic retractor, we found our Eikon retractor system had approximately five times the illumination area with a thermal profile that is below the risk of burn.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improved surgical precision during open and minimal access procedures. Our technology is designed to improve intracavity visualization to allow surgeons to identify, differentiate and avoid vital anatomical structures. We believe this enables surgeons to dissect with great precision, while also allowing them to differentiate tissue planes, identify and avoid nerves and blood vessels, and quickly locate and control bleeding vessels to achieve rapid hemostasis. With this precise visualization, we believe surgeons may be able to use smaller, and in some cases fewer, incisions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reduced risks to patients and surgeons. Our technology is developed with design elements to help create thermally cool illumination as well as ergonomics to improve ease of use while performing a procedure. Our advanced surgical devices incorporate a solid core optical-grade polymer that facilitates efficient coupling to the surgical instrument to offer significantly improved light transfer while concurrently reducing heat transfer. We believe this is an important advancement over traditional on-field fiber optic lighting systems that do not efficiently transfer light through the fiber-to-fiber coupling, resulting in the generation of excess heat, which can increase the risk of burn to patients and surgical staff and create the potential for operating room fires. In addition, by improving visualization, our devices may also decrease risk of unintended retained foreign objects by improving the surgeon’s ability to see and dispose of such objects that might have otherwise been left in the surgical cavity inadvertently. Finally, by being directly incorporated into a variety of illuminated surgical retractors, handheld illuminated aspiration devices, and drop-in intracavity illuminators, we believe our technology may help to decrease surgeon fatigue by reducing or eliminating the need for surgical headlights, thereby helping to reduce some of the associated head, neck and shoulder fatigue, frequent headaches, neck pain and injury to the cervical spine. In addition, our non-conductive Eikon LT retractors virtually eliminate the potential for burns due to arcing from electrosurgical devices coming in contact with traditional stainless steel retractors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enhanced operating room efficiency. We believe our technology improves operating room workflow by reducing the need for perioperative repositioning of traditional surgical lighting options. Overhead lighting systems and headlights require frequent readjustment, which may interrupt operating room workflow and extend surgical procedure time. Many open and minimal access procedures are time sensitive and the treatment area requires constant attention of the surgeon and operating team. Because our optical waveguides are directly connected to the surgical instrument that is used to access the deep surgical cavity, surgeons are able to clearly illuminate the surgical target and effectively focus on performing the procedure. As an example, in a survey we conducted with 12 surgeons that use our devices, each of whom is considered a leading breast surgeon, 11 of these surgeons reported that procedure time during nipple-sparing mastectomy procedures when using our devices was reduced by an average of 24%.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Economic value proposition to healthcare systems. We believe our devices have the potential to substantially reduce procedure costs as well as create incremental revenue opportunities. We believe the improved efficiency of the operating room workflow and the related reduced procedure and anesthesia time can translate to meaningful cost savings for the hospital. In addition, we believe the reduction in procedure times also creates additional capacity in the operating room for surgeons to perform more procedures, which we believe can create incremental revenue for the hospital.

     Our Intelligent Photonics Technology
     Photonics is the science and technical application of light. We have applied advanced principles of photonics to develop our Intelligent Photonics technology platform, which enables the transmission, management and manipulation of light in surgical procedures. Our initial application of this technology is our family of proprietary optical waveguides. The fundamental attributes of our optical waveguides include a solid core optical-grade polymer, total internal reflection of light waves, light mixing and extraction by a complex geometry of refractive microstructures or microlenses.      Fundamental Attributes of Our Optical Waveguides
    
 Solid Core Optical-Grade Polymer
     Our optical waveguides are fabricated from a proprietary solid core optical-grade polymer, specifically selected for its key optical and mechanical characteristics, which enable the efficient transmission and management of light. These optical characteristics include the ability to mold the material into various complex geometries, which is of particular importance when molding ultra-precise structures. Certain mechanical properties of the polymer, such as structural integrity, hydrophobicity and thermal stability, are critical to its use during surgical procedures. In addition, our solid core design facilitates the coupling of the waveguide to the modified fiber optic cable in order to allow the efficient transfer of light into the solid core waveguide, while remaining thermally cool. All these characteristics are critical in order for the waveguide to function as an advanced illuminated surgical device.     Total Internal Reflection of Light Waves
     One of the key aspects of the optical waveguide technology is the ability to transmit light in a highly efficient manner prior to its extraction. Light travels in waves. As a wave travels through a medium it will reach a boundary where there is a different medium on the other side of the boundary. At the point where the wave meets the boundary, three phenomena can occur: reflection, refraction or some combination of both. Reflection occurs when light bounces off the boundary and refraction occurs when waves pass through a boundary and change direction. The angle at which the wave hits the boundary is referred to as the angle of incidence. That angle is usually referenced to the line that is perpendicular to the boundary. A zero incidence angle means that the wave is traveling perpendicular to the boundary. At that angle most of the light will pass most of its energy through the boundary and will not refract as long as the index of refraction is less on the other side of the boundary than in the medium the light is traveling. As the angle of incidence increases, the wave will get split into two components: one portion will pass the boundary and refract and the other portion will reflect back into the medium in which the wave was originally traveling. As the angle increases, the amount of refraction will decrease and reflection will increase. The smallest angle where the light is completely reflected and not refracted is called the critical angle. At any angle of incidence greater than the critical angle, all of the light is reflected off the boundary with no refraction. This is referred to as total internal reflection. We designed the structural and material properties of our devices to maximize locations of total internal reflection as the light propagates along the central axis of the waveguide.

 Light Mixing
     Our optical waveguides utilize various novel optical methods to mix light, or randomize its reflections, during the total internal reflection transmission process. The design and shape of the optical stem, or area of the waveguide that is between the input of the waveguide and the array of refractive microstructures or microlenses, enhance the mixing of light waves, while maintaining total internal reflection. Our optical waveguides utilize light mixing before extraction to significantly reduce glare and bright spots, leading to a more uniform illumination profile across the surgical target while remaining thermally cool.     Complex Geometry of Refractive Microstructures and Microlenses
     We designed a proprietary complex geometry of refractive microstructures and microlenses that are placed on the surface of the optical waveguide to extract light from the device in a manner that distributes light over the surgical target. This distribution of light from the waveguide also reduces the energy density in the device, thus reducing heat. Without the microstructures to extract the light uniformly on the surgical target, the waveguide would dissipate an energy density across its surface that is in excess of the amount that the tissue could absorb without causing thermal injury. The surface of the waveguide contains a complex geometry of zones with corresponding refractive microstructures or microlenses at varying angles. These extraction zones allow the waveguide to direct the extracted light onto the surgical target and shape it into a broad, uniform and volumetric pattern. The ability to direct light is especially important when the waveguide is mounted on surgical retractors, because our device is able to push the light away from the retractor, thus maintaining its efficiency on the surgical target. We believe this is a significant advantage over traditional on-field fiber optic lighting systems, which lack the microstructures to direct light and instead direct light in a straight line in the shape of a cone from the end of the fiber. As a result, a portion of the illumination is obstructed and absorbed by the surgical retractors when the fiber is adjacent to the surgical instrument. The ability to shape light is also critical, as it reduces the focal intensity of light. With traditional fiber optic retractors, light is directed in a narrow beam, with intensity at a maximum in the center of the spot of light, and dropping off exponentially toward the edges. As a result, it typically does not illuminate the entire surgical cavity and heat builds up significantly in that focal zone. In contrast, our waveguides broaden this intensity of distribution, which allows the pattern of light to have uniform brightness across the surface of the surgical target, while minimizing the thermal profile.
     Our waveguides are also designed to extract light from multiple zones, allowing the surgical target to be illuminated from various angles. As light is extracted across the waveguide at numerous different points along the surface at slightly different angles, if any of the features on the surface become blocked by an instrument, blood or tissue, there are multiple other microstructures from which light is extracted to provide illumination. This proprietary complex geometry also provides off-axis illumination on the surgical target, meaning that the light originates from a different angle than in direct orientation to the waveguide. As such, when light reflects off the tissue of the surgical target, instead of reflecting upwards towards the surgeon, the light is generally reflected onto the surface opposite the retractor. This feature of the waveguide is important because it allows the surgeon and operating staff much better visual perception of the surgical target with less shadows and glare.
     Our Products
     Our advanced photonics technology has allowed us to design multiple variations of our waveguides in order to target different illumination patterns for different shapes of surgical cavities. Because we can mold our solid core optical-grade polymer into different shapes, we are able to design waveguides that either direct the light narrowly for deep cavities, or broadly for larger blade cavities. Our waveguides also come in narrow or wide configurations to accommodate various retractor widths that are designed for varying patient anatomies. Our versatile design and manufacturing capabilities allow us to develop waveguides with a variety of extraction patterns. For example, our current retractor based waveguides utilize a complex geometry of refractive microstructures and microlenses, whereas as our handheld illuminated aspiration devices have integrated microlens arrays. Using advanced ray-trace software modeling programs, we are able to perform three-dimensional optical performance modeling of our waveguides, as well as an entire assembly including the retractor. We are capable of analyzing the entire optical performance of the assembly as we monitor various characteristics such as extracted light direction, uniformity on the target, glare to the user, as well as thermal profile. This ray-trace modeling process helps us develop illuminated surgical devices that are designed to provide optimal intracavity illumination.

      Selected Surgical Applications
     Our commercial strategy is initially focused on targeting open and minimal access procedures where there is a significant need for improved illumination and direct visualization. These procedures span a broad spectrum of women’s health clinical applications: breast cancer and breast reconstruction surgery, gynecology and thyroid surgery. Additional applications include procedures for electrophysiology, spine, orthopedic, cardiothoracic, and general surgery. We believe our technology has enabled surgeons to perform procedures that were previously difficult to perform due to visualization and illumination challenges. The selected procedures discussed below illustrate some of the benefits of our technology.     Breast: Nipple Sparing Mastectomy
     Surgical management of breast cancer has evolved dramatically over the past several decades. Surgeons have continuously looked for ways to improve oncologic outcomes while combining the techniques of oncoplastic surgery to maximize both the treatment of cancer and the aesthetic outcome with the optimal goal of preserving the nipple areola complex. Skin and nipple preservation during breast cancer surgery is essential to attain ideal aesthetic results.
     A nipple sparing mastectomy, or NSM, is a procedure in which the cancerous breast tissue is removed but the breast skin and nipple are left intact. We believe the relatively limited adoption to date of the NSM procedure is attributed to a number of surgical limitations. Some of these limitations include limited access and visualization through smaller and distant incision location, and difficulty in maintaining consistent breast flap thickness and viability. We believe our advanced photonics technology can facilitate a surgeon’s ability to:
    
· | use a single infra-mammary fold incision in NSM to access and visualize deep into the surgical cavity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | access and visualize the lymphatic tree without a second axillary incision in most cases; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | assess the breast flap thickness and viability via trans-illumination.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

     GYN: Vaginal Hysterectomy
     Hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus, is one of the most common types of surgery for women in the United States Depending on the condition, many women will be presented with several surgical procedural options.  Such surgical approaches may be an abdominal, robotic, vaginal, laparoscopic or laparoscopically-assisted hysterectomy. All options, other than vaginal hysterectomy will result in some form of visible scarring and a potentially greater degree of postoperative pain.
     A vaginal hysterectomy allows the surgeon to perform a total or radical hysterectomy through the vagina, a natural opening in the body.  We believe that our advanced photonics technology can facilitate the surgeon’s ability to:
    
· | effectively perform a vaginal hysterectomy through enhanced visualization of key structures and anatomy
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | optimally treat pelvic organ prolapse, concomitant in approximately 33% of vaginal or laparoscopically assisted hysterectomies; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | provide for a safe and effective operation through the use of illuminated non-conductive retractors
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Orthopedics: Total Hip Arthroplasty including the Anterior Approach
     The growth of minimally invasive surgery in orthopedics has been dramatic worldwide, as clinical results indicate that patients who undergo these procedures typically experience improved clinical outcomes, shorter hospital stays, faster rehabilitation and improved aesthetic outcomes. Our technology has been used in a range of procedures including, among others, hip arthroplasty, within which the use of our technology has enabled a less invasive approach.
     Traditional hip replacement, also known as hip arthroplasty, involves operating from the side or the back of the hip, which can create a significant disturbance of the muscles and tendons and an incision approximately eight to twelve inches long. In comparison, the direct frontal, or anterior, approach requires an incision that is only three to four inches long and located at the front of the hip. In this position, the surgeon does not need to detach any of the muscles or tendons, but rather can move them aside along their natural tissue planes. This approach often results in faster recovery, less pain and more normal function after hip replacement. In addition, there is a lower risk of dislocating the new prosthesis when placed via the anterior approach, as the strength and integrity of the adjacent tendons and muscles surrounding the hip are maintained.
     To date, we believe the less invasive anterior approach has been underutilized due, in part, to the visualization challenges associated with the procedure. More specifically, because the acetabulum and femoral canal are difficult to visualize using this approach, component positioning, sizing, and stability are more likely to be compromised, all of which are critical factors to yielding a successful and durable clinical outcome.
     We believe the visualization provided by our devices can facilitate the surgeon’s ability to:
    
· | expose, prepare and seat the acetabular shell and liner within the acetabulum;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | place the acetabular screw;
--+----------------------------


· | evaluate stability and impingement of the ball against the socket;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | prepare and mobilize the femur; and
--+------------------------------------


· | internally inspect the femoral canal.
--+--------------------------------------

      Additional Applications
     Our existing portfolio of devices is also eligible for use in, and could potentially improve the viability of, a multitude of additional surgical procedures. Importantly, our devices could be marketed and sold for a broad spectrum of surgical specialties without the need for any additional regulatory clearance. We believe our technology could help address the

illumination and visualization challenges associated with various general surgery procedures, including appendectomy and herniorrhaphy; hysterectomy and other urological, gynecological and colorectal procedures; thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy and other ear, nose and throat procedures; cardiac, cardiothoracic and cardiovascular procedures; craniomaxillofacial procedures and aesthetic plastic surgery.
     We also continue to research and develop new devices, as well as pursue new clinical applications.
     Sales and Marketing
     We began selling our first FDA-cleared waveguide-based device in March 2009. As a result, we have limited experience marketing and selling our devices. We currently sell our devices through our direct sales representatives only in the United States. While we primarily sell directly to hospitals, surgeons typically drive the purchasing decision. We sold our devices to approximately 745 hospitals in the fourth quarter of 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had a sales and marketing team of 106 employees. Our sales team consisted of 67 direct sales representatives and 14 independent sales agents or agencies, whom we refer to as independent sales agents, all of whom had significant sales experience before joining our sales team. The direct sales representatives are supported by five Directors of Strategic Accounts and Business Development and 20 employees in sales management, training and customer support. Additionally, we have eight employees in marketing. Over the past two years, we have significantly expanded our direct sales force to help facilitate further adoption among existing hospital accounts, as well as to broaden awareness of our advanced photonics technology to new hospitals. Using our expanded direct sales force, we intend to continue to educate and train surgeons on the advantages of our advanced photonics technology compared to traditional operating room lighting options. We believe the benefits of our technology should also enable the broader application and adoption of minimal access surgical procedures by more surgeons. Our operating results are directly dependent upon the sales and marketing efforts of our employees.
     Our marketing efforts are focused on developing a strong reputation with major teaching institutions and hospitals, as well as surgeons that we have identified as key opinion leaders based on their knowledge of our devices, clinical expertise and reputation. We developed the Invuity Hidden ScarTM Surgery program to train and certify surgeons on minimal access surgical approaches and designate Centers of Excellence in Hidden Scar Surgery at hospitals and medical centers. Breast cancer surgery is our initial focus with the Hidden Scar Breast Surgery program and we are expanding into other specialties to include Hidden Scar Breast Reconstruction and Hidden Scar Hysterectomy to form a broader women’s health initiative.  
     We also sell and market to third-party medical device manufacturers. The majority of these sales have been to Zimmer Biomet, Inc. as part of its spinal implant surgical systems. Sales to Zimmer Biomet, Inc. or its predecessor in interest, Lanx, Inc., accounted for approximately 4%, 7%, and 12% of our total revenue in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. There were no other sales to any customer in excess of 10% of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014. 
     Coverage and Reimbursement
     Payment for patient care in the United States is generally made by third-party payors, including private insurers and government insurance programs. The reimbursement to the facility from third-party payors is intended to cover the overall cost of treatment, including the cost of our devices used during the procedure as well as the overhead cost associated with the facility where the procedure is performed. We do not directly bill any third-party payors; instead, we receive payment from the hospital or surgical center for our devices. Failure by physicians, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and other users of our devices to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from healthcare payors for procedures in which our devices are used, or adverse changes in government and private third-party payors’ policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects.
     In addition, there are periodic changes to reimbursement. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes annual updates to payments to physicians, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers for procedures during which our devices are used. Because the cost of our devices generally is recovered by the healthcare provider as part of the payment for performing a procedure and not separately reimbursed, these updates could directly impact the demand for our devices. An example of such payment updates is the Medicare program’s updates to hospital and physician payments, which are 

 
  12

 
done on an annual basis using a prescribed statutory formula. In the past, with respect to reimbursement for physician services under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions. 
     Any changes in coverage and reimbursement that lowers reimbursement for procedures using our devices could materially affect our business.
     Competition
     The medical device industry is highly competitive. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain a competitive position in the development of technologies and devices for surgical illumination and visualization. We face significant competition from competitors that are based in the United States and internationally in the surgical illumination and visualization market, and we expect the intensity of competition will increase over time. Surgeons and hospitals typically use traditional overhead lighting, headlights and fiber optic lighting products, and if we cannot convince surgeons and hospitals of the benefits of using our devices in addition to, or as an alternative to, traditional overhead lighting and headlights, or, of the benefits of using our devices instead of using competing fiber optic lighting products, our business may be harmed. Some of our main competitors are Lumitex, Inc., Scintillant (Engineered Medical Solutions Co. LLC), Cura Surgical, Inc., Stryker Corporation, TeDan Surgical Innovations, LLC, and Black & Black Surgical, Inc. and other general surgical instrument companies that supply traditional fiber optic retractors. Many of the companies developing or marketing competing products enjoy several competitive advantages, including:
· | more established sales and marketing programs and distribution networks;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | long established relationships with surgeons and hospitals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | contractual relationships with customers;
--+------------------------------------------


· | products that have already received approval from the relevant value analysis committees, or VACs,;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | greater name recognition;
--+--------------------------


· | the ability to offer rebates or bundle multiple product offerings to offer greater discounts or incentives; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | greater experience in and resources for conducting research and development, clinical studies, manufacturing, preparing regulatory submissions, obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for products and marketing approved products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Any device we develop must compete for market acceptance and market share. We believe that the primary competitive factors in the surgical illumination and visualization market segment are clinical safety and effectiveness, price, surgeon experience and comfort with use of particular illumination systems, reliability and durability, ease of use, device support and service, sales force experience and relationships. Our success in selling our devices to hospitals is dependent on our ability to demonstrate that the clinical, qualitative and economic value delivered by our products outweighs their increase to the cost per procedure. Our ability to compete on price depends on our ability to demonstrate to surgeons, hospitals and surgery centers that the potential benefits of improved clinical outcomes and reduced procedure costs from the increased efficiency in the operating room workflow and related reduced procedure and anesthesia time using our medical devices outweigh the price of our devices compared to our competitors’ products.
     Intellectual Property
     In order to remain competitive, we must protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and, if granted, maintaining patents intended to cover our products and inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights.
    
 
  13

 

 It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also forbid them from using the proprietary rights of third parties in their work for us. We also require confidentiality agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
     Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
     As of December 31, 2016, we held 44 issued U.S. and foreign patents and had 30 U.S. and foreign utility patent applications, and 16 Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications pending. As we continue to research and develop our Intelligent Photonics technology, we intend to file additional U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the design, manufacture and clinical uses of our illuminated devices and other products. Our issued patents expire between the years 2026 and 2035. Our pending patent applications and issued patents include claims directed to coupling of an illumination device with a light source or an instrument, as well as efficient and safe transmission of light through the illumination device.1
     As of December 31, 2016, we held 38 U.S., foreign and international trademark registrations and had eight U.S. and foreign trademark applications.
     Manufacturing, Raw Materials and Quality Assurance
     Our manufacturing involves the combined utilization of our internal manufacturing resources and expertise, approved suppliers and contract manufacturers. Our internal manufacturing activities, located in San Francisco, California, include the inspection, assembly and packaging of the waveguides, retractor systems, aspiration devices and accessories associated with each of our device families. We outsource the manufacture of components, subassemblies and certain finished devices that are produced to our specifications and shipped to our facilities for final assembly or inspection, and certification. Finished products are stored at and distributed from our facility. Quality control, risk management, efficiency and the ability to respond quickly to changing requirements are the primary goals of our manufacturing operations.
     We have arrangements with our suppliers that allow us to adjust the delivery quantities of components, subassemblies and finished products, as well as delivery schedules, to match our changing requirements. The forecasts we use are based on historical trends, current utilization patterns and sales forecasts of future demand. Lead times for components, subassemblies and finished products may vary significantly depending on the size of the order, specific supplier requirements and current market demand for the components and subassemblies. Most of our suppliers have no contractual obligations to supply us with, and we are not contractually obligated to purchase from them, the components used in our devices.
     We obtain the optical polymer used in the manufacture of our waveguides and certain accessories from single suppliers, for which we attempt to mitigate risks through inventory management and purchase order commitments. While we believe alternate sources exist for the optical polymer, we have not qualified an alternate provider. Other products and components come from single suppliers, but alternate suppliers have been qualified or, we believe, can be readily identified and qualified. In addition, we rely on a single provider for sterilization of our devices that require sterilization. While we believe replacement suppliers exist for all components, materials and services we obtain from single sources, establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of these components, materials or services, if required, may not be accomplished quickly. Even if we are able to find a replacement supplier, the replacement supplier may need to be qualified and may require additional regulatory authority approval, which could result in further delay. While we seek to maintain adequate inventory of the single-source components and materials used in our products, in the event of disruption, those inventories may not be sufficient. To date, we have not experienced material delays in obtaining any of our components, subassemblies or finished products, nor has the ready supply of finished products to our customers been 
 adversely affected. To date, we have not experienced any material delays by our sterilization provider and will continue to evaluate the cost and benefit of qualifying a second sterilization provider.
     We have implemented a quality management system designed to comply with FDA regulations and International Standards Organization, or ISO, standards governing medical device products. These regulations govern the design, 

 
  14

 
manufacture, testing and release of diagnostic products as well as raw material receipt and control. We have received ISO 13485 certification as well as an European Counsel, or EC, Certificate under Directive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices, Annex II, excluding section 4. Our key outsourcing partners are ISO-certified.
     We use small quantities of common cleaning products in our manufacturing operations, which are lawfully disposed of through a normal waste management program. We do not forecast any material costs due to compliance with environmental laws or regulations.
     Segment Reporting
     We manage our operations as a single operating segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. All of our assets are maintained in the United States. We derive our revenue from sales to customers in the United States, based upon the billing address of the customer.     Government Regulation
     Our products are medical devices and are therefore subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as by corresponding state and international regulatory authorities. The regulations govern the following activities that we and our suppliers, licensors and partners engage in:
· | product design and development;
--+--------------------------------


· | pre-clinical and clinical testing;
--+-----------------------------------


· | establishment registration and product listing;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | product manufacturing;
--+-----------------------


· | labeling and storage;
--+----------------------


· | pre-market clearance or approval; advertising and promotion;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | product sales and distribution;
--+--------------------------------


· | recalls and field safety corrective actions; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | servicing and post-market surveillance.
--+----------------------------------------

      Regulatory Clearances and Approvals.  Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we wish to commercially distribute in the United States will require either prior 510(k) clearance or Premarket Approval Application, or PMA, approval from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose low or moderate risk are placed in Classes I or II, which, unless subject to an exemption, requires the manufacturer to submit to FDA a 510(k) premarket notification requesting clearance for commercial distribution. Exempt Class I and II devices do not require submission of a 510(k) but are otherwise subject to general controls such as labeling, pre-market notification and adherence to the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which cover manufacturers’ methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of products. Certain Class II devices are also subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidelines, or particularized labeling. Our waveguides, retractor and aspiration devices are marketed as Class I exempt devices. The fiber optic cables we supply as part of our illuminated retractor and aspiration systems are marketed as Class II exempt devices. The metal and plastic sterilization trays used by the customer to sterilize our reusable retractors and fiber optic cables are Class II 510(k) products.
     To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 and for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of PMAs. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance 

 
  15

 
pathway usually takes between three and 12 months from the date the notification is submitted, but can take considerably longer, depending on the extent of requests for additional information from the FDA and the amount of time a sponsor takes to fulfill them. FDA requests for additional information can include clinical data that the FDA determines is necessary to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. We obtained 510(k) clearance for the BriteField McCulloch Retractor System, in April of 2009 and for the Eigr Surgical Illumination System in February of 2012. All of our other commercial products to date have been commercialized as Class I, Class II exempt or Class II devices.
     After a device receives 510(k) clearance or is commercialized as a Class I or II exempt device, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require premarket approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this decision initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval is obtained. We have made, and plan to continue to make, product enhancements that we believe do not require new 510(k) clearances. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or premarket approval for any such modifications to previously commercialized products, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval, and we could be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
     A PMA must be submitted if a device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) clearance process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical information, preclinical data, clinical trial data, manufacturing data and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use. None of our existing products are currently approved under a PMA, and we have no plans to develop products that would require a PMA.
     Continuing FDA Regulation. Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
    
· | establishment registration and device listing with FDA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | labeling regulations that prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses, and impose other restrictions on labeling, advertising and promotional activities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | voluntary and mandatory device recalls to address problems when a device is defective and could be a risk to health; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We and our contract manufacturers, specification developers and some suppliers of components or device accessories, also are required to manufacture our products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and it includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA and the California Food and Drug Branch evaluate compliance with the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If the FDA or the California Food and Drug Branch believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of 

 
  16

 
our products, refuse to clear new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees.
     Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. These may include any of the following sanctions or consequences:
    
· | warning letters or untitled letters that require corrective action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines and civil penalties;
--+---------------------------


· | delays in clearing or refusal to clear future products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | suspension or withdrawal of FDA clearances;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | product recall or seizure;
--+---------------------------


· | interruption or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | operating restrictions;
--+------------------------


· | injunctions; and
--+-----------------


· | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

      Fraud and Abuse Laws. There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims, physician payment and privacy and security laws. Our relationships with healthcare providers and other third parties are subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including the Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs.
     Federal Anti-Kickback Laws. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations, commonly known as safe harbors, that set forth certain provisions which, if fully met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the HHS Office of Inspector General.
     The penalties for violating the Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment for up to five years, fines of up to $25,000 per violation and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items and services reimbursed by any source, not only by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or PPACA, amends the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. The PPACA also provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes.
    
 
  17

 

 Federal False Claims Act. The Federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, amendments in 1986 to the Federal False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against companies under the Federal False Claims Act. Penalties include fines ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action.
     Civil Monetary Penalties Law. The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance can result in civil money penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.
     State Fraud and Abuse Provisions. Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and a false claims act. A determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
     Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. In addition, similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.
     Physician Payment Transparency Laws. There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. PPACA, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on device manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Device manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”) for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
     Data Privacy and Security Laws. We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health 

 
  18

 
information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
     U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making corrupt payments, gifts or transfers to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA would include interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries.
     International Regulation
     We may evaluate international expansion opportunities in the future. International sales of medical devices are subject to local government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries. 
     The primary regulatory body in Europe is that of the European Union, which includes most of the major countries in Europe. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the conformity CE marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a “Notified Body.” This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s product. An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union. Additional local requirements may apply on a country-by-country basis. Outside of the European Union, regulatory approval would need to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order for us to market our devices.
     Research and Development
     We have an experienced research and development team with the scientific, engineering and process talent that we believe is necessary to grow our business. As of December 31, 2016, we had 14 employees engaged in research and development. Our research and development team has the technical and engineering knowledge that we believe is necessary to develop next-generation technology, as well as the advanced educational backgrounds in physics, optics, biomedical and mechanical engineering to support innovation in these areas.
     We expect to commit significant resources to developing new technologies and devices, improving product performance and reducing costs. We continually seek to enhance and iterate our existing devices. Our research and development expenses totaled $9.9 million, $7.9 million and $5.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We also expect to expand our technology to create next generation devices and new platform offerings. In addition, we are engaged in advanced research related to inclusion of illumination in other medical devices, as well as further improvements in visualization and tissue differentiation.
     Seasonality
     Traditionally, we have experienced seasonality during the year. Revenue tends to be the lowest in the first quarter as the result of the resetting of annual patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles and by hospitals and military facilities working off their inventories of products purchased in the fourth quarter. The third quarter is similarly negatively impacted by lower procedure rates typically associated with vacation plans of both patients and surgeons. Revenue in the fourth quarter tends to be the highest as demand may be impacted by the desire of patients to spend their remaining balances in their flexible spending accounts or because they have met their annual deductibles under their health insurance plans. In addition, in the fourth quarter, our results can be impacted by the budgeting and buying patterns of hospitals and military facilities.

 Employees
     As of December 31, 2016, we had 172 full-time employees, which included 106 employees engaged in sales and marketing, 14 employees engaged in research and development, 39 employees engaged in manufacturing and quality assurance and 13 general and administrative employees. None of our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced any work stoppages. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
