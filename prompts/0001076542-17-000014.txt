Company Overview; Recent Developments
 
El Capitan Precious Metals, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is based in Prescott, Arizona. Together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Company,” “our” or “we”), the Company is an exploration stage company as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) Industry Guide 7, as the Company has no established reserves as required under the Industry Guide 7. We are principally engaged in the exploration of precious metals and other minerals. We have owned interests in several properties located in the southwestern United States in the past. Currently, our primary asset is a 100% equity ownership interest in El Capitan, Ltd., an Arizona corporation (“ECL”), which holds an interest in the El Capitan property located near Capitan, New Mexico (the “El Capitan Property”). Our ultimate objective is to market and sell the El Capitan Property to a major mining company or enter into a joint venture arrangement with a major mining company to conduct mining operations.
 
Based on results from testing conducted on mineralized material at the El Capitan Property during fiscal years 2013 and 2014, we determined the existence and concentration of potentially commercially extractable precious metals or other minerals. We subsequently completed testing and enhancement of our recovery process for such mineralized material and our evaluation as to the economic and legal feasibility of the property. Employing our testing results, we determined to put the El Capitan Property into mineral exploration production to assist us in marketing it for potential sale to a major mining company and to create potential cash flow for the Company through the sale of mineralized material removed from the El Capitan Property and, separately, iron ore extracted from such mineralized material.
 
We commenced mineral exploration activity in the quarter ended December 2015 under our modified mining permit. However, we have not yet demonstrated the existence of proven or probable reserves at our El Capitan Property. To date, we have not had any material revenue producing operations. We have recorded nominal revenues during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 consisting of revenue for test loads of iron ore to a construction contractor. There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on our property.
 
“Mineralized material” as used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, although permissible under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC’s”) Industry Guide 7, does not indicate “reserves” by SEC standards. We cannot be certain that any part of the El Capitan Property will ever be confirmed or converted into SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant “reserves.” Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the mineralized material will ever be confirmed or converted into reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted. 
 
Business Operations
 
We are considered an exploration stage company and have not established any “reserves” with respect to our exploration projects, and will remain an exploration stage company until the Company has reserves as defined in SEC Industry Guide 7. The Company may never meet the reserve requirements or enter into development with respect to any of our properties.
 
Arrangements with Glencore AG and Logistica
 
On March 10, 2014, the Company entered into a life-of-mine off take agreement with Glencore AG (“Glencore”) for the sale of iron extracted from mineralized material at the El Capitan Property (such agreement is referred to herein as the “Glencore Purchase Contract”). Under the terms of the Glencore Purchase Contract, the Company agreed to sell to Glencore, and Glencore agreed to purchase from the Company, iron that meets the applicable specifications from the El Capitan Property mine. Payment for the iron is to be made pursuant an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the Company. The purchase price is based on an index price less an applicable discount. Either party may terminate the Glencore Purchase Contract following a breach by the other party that remains uncured for a specified period after receipt of written notice. Because of current market iron ore prices, the contract has not been implemented or terminated.

In anticipation of, and in conjunction with, the Glencore Purchase Contract, the Company entered into a Master Services Agreement (the “Master Agreement”) and corresponding Iron Ore Processing Agreement (the “Processing Agreement”) with Logistica U.S. Terminals, LLC (“Logistica”), each effective as of February 28, 2014. Pursuant to these agreements, Logistica agreed to, among other things, provide the logistics required for the Company to fulfill its obligations under the Glencore Purchase Contract, to assist the Company in financing the costs of processing and delivering iron under the Glencore Purchase Contract, and to provide and/or manage the processing that iron. Because of current market iron ore prices, the contract was not implemented.
 
The contracts with Logistica were superseded by a new agreement entered into on January 5, 2016. Under the new agreement, we will provide to Logistica concentrated ore to their specifications at the mine site, and Logistica will transport, process, and refine the precious metals concentrates to sell to precious metals buyers. When certain terms and conditions are met, the new agreement calls for Logistica to arrange for a letter of credit for working capital for the mining, processing and sale activities. For additional information regarding the Glencore Purchase Contract and our agreements with Logistica, see Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
In late April 2014, we announced the purchase of a heavy metals separation system from AuraSource, Inc (OTCBB and OCTGB: ARAO). This state-of-the-art technology will separate hematite and magnetite from other mineral elements in the El Capitan mineral deposits. The AuraSource process leaves a concentrate for additional processing that is used by the Company to extract the precious metals.
 
The Company has methods for both the separation of the iron and the separation and recovery of the precious metals that have repeatedly yielded consistent and commercially viable economic value results. Yet another significant aspect of these breakthrough technologies for separation and recovery is that they are environmentally friendly and do not rely on the use of caustic chemicals.
 
On August 4, 2015, we signed a contract with independent subcontract miner to mine, process and concentrate the ore at the El Capitan site. The clearing of the overburden at the site commenced later in the August.
 
Price of Precious Metals
 
Gold and silver are each traded as investments on various world markets, including London, New York, Zurich and Tokyo, and are fixed twice daily in London. The “fix” is the reference price on which a large number of precious metal transactions around the world are based. The price is set by a number of market members matching buy and sell orders from all over the world.
 
High, low and average London afternoon fix prices for gold and silver for the period from January 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016 and for the last five calendar years are as follows:

Our ability to sell the El Capitan Property will be highly dependent upon the price of these precious metals, the market for which can be highly volatile. There is no assurance that we will be able to recover precious metals from the El Capitan Property or that we will generate significant revenue from the sale of the El Capitan Property.
 
Competition
 
The mining industry has historically been highly competitive. It is dominated by multi-billion dollar, multi-national companies that possess resources significantly greater than ours. Additionally, due to our limited resources, we do not intend to develop any of our properties on our own, but rather to only perform exploration on our properties with the anticipation of selling or developing through a joint venture any properties in which our exploration proves successful. Given our size and financial condition, there is no assurance we can compete with any larger companies for the acquisition of additional potential mineral properties, and we have no current plans to do so.
Government Regulation
 
Mining and exploration is highly regulated and subject to various constantly changing federal and state laws and regulations. These laws are becoming more and more restrictive, and include without limitation: the Clean Water Act; the Clean Air Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; the Federal Land Policy and Management Act; the National Environmental Policy Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and related state laws. The environmental protection laws dramatically impact the mining and mineral extraction industries as it pertains to both the use of hazardous materials in the mining and extraction process and from the standpoint of returning the land to a natural look once the mining process is completed. Compliance with federal and state environmental regulations can be expensive and time-consuming, and given our limited resources, such regulations may have a material effect on the success of our operations.
 
Compliance with the various federal and state governmental regulations requires us to obtain multiple permits for each mining property. Although the requirements may differ slightly in each of the respective states in which we may hold claims or may hold claims in the future, the process of securing such permits generally require the filing of a “Notice of Intent to Locate Mining Claims” and the payment of a fee of $25 to the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) office in the state in which the claim is located. Subsequently, we are required to file and record a New Location Notice for each such claim within 90 days of locating the claim, the fee for which is approximately $165. On an annual basis, we are required to pay a maintenance fee of $155 per claim.
 
To the extent we intend to take action on a property that is more than “casual use,” which generally includes activities that cause only negligible disturbance to the land (this would not generally include drilling or operating earthmoving equipment on the property), we are required to prepare and file with the BLM either a notice of operation or plan of operation identifying the activity we intend to take on the property, including a plan of reclamation indicating how we intend to return the land to its prior state upon completion of our activities. For each claim that we file a notice or plan of operations, we are required to pay a one-time reclamation bond to the BLM to be used toward restoration of the property upon completion of our activities. The amount of the reclamation bond is determined by the BLM based upon the scope of the activity described in the notice or plan of operation, and will thus vary with each property.

In connection with the original plan of operation on the El Capitan Property that we filed with the BLM, we were required to pay a reclamation bond of $15,000. Upon payment we were issued a notice to proceed from the BLM. This allowed us to proceed with our original plan of operation on up to five (5) acres.  The permit was received by the Company from the previous owners of the El Capitan Property under a grandfather clause and allows operations on five (5) acres of the property at a time. In 2015, we amended the permit to allow operations on forty acres (40) of property at a time. The amended permit was issued in March 25, 2015, and we were required to increase our reclamation bond to $74,499.
 
In July 2007, we submitted a Plan of Operation for continued exploration on a 2,000 acre parcel within our more than 7,000 acres, at that time, Company claim block near Capitan, New Mexico with the U.S. Forest Service (“USFS”). We hired an experienced environmental services firm to manage this effort. Having this permit in place would provide the opportunity for a professional and methodical investigation into the additional geologic potential of this portion of our holdings, without requiring further time-consuming permitting efforts. The area being permitted will allow access to a number of high-potential targets identified through previous surface sampling and remote sensing efforts, as well as to the prospective area to the west of the existing deposit, which remains open to geologic resource extension. The USFS permitting effort is governed by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 (“NEPA”) and under the General Mining Law of 1872, as amended. In conjunction with the USFS filing, the Company submitted an Exploration Permit with the New Mexico Mining and Minerals Division (“MMD”). The permitting process is a robust process that can take a significant amount of time to complete. The typical process generally takes longer than the prescribed regulatory time frame, and is dependent upon a number of factors outside of our control, including, without limitation, governmental approvals, licensing and permitting, as well as potential opposition by third parties. Both permits must be approved prior to the commencement of drilling activity. 
 
In July 2008, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the USFS related to the permitting of 112 exploration drill holes planned on 2,000 acres of Company claims in Lincoln County, New Mexico. The action signaled the initiation of the Federal Environmental Assessment (“EA”) permitting process. It was originally anticipated that the receipt of these two permits would occur in the second or third quarter of 2009. Subsequently in late 2008, this process was put on hold due to a lack of working capital and a potential conflict of interest with the USFS by the environmental services firm we were utilizing for the permitting process.
 
In December 2009, we hired a new experienced environmental services firm, AMEC Environment & Infrastructure, Inc. (“AMEC”), to manage and oversee our continued permitting process. AMEC has drafted a replacement Plan of Operations (“PoO”) and submitted it to the USFS. The USFS has provided technical comments on the PoO and AMEC has responded to their comments and submitted a revised PoO for approval. AMEC has met with representatives of the USFS at the project site to review the proposed exploration locations and general discussion of the project. Subsequent to the meeting, the USFS agreed to work with AMEC to develop the third part of the NEPA scope of work. The USFS provided a draft NEPA scope of work template to AMEC in electronic format. AMEC revised the draft template and submitted it to the USFS for review and approval.
 
AMEC has also prepared the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (“SWPPP”) that will be sent to the agencies upon permit approval. Informational copies of the SWPPP will be provided to the MMD and the USFS.  The SWPPP is an EPA required document for construction projects that disturb more than one (1) acre of land.  Prior to field activities, coverage under the New Mexico Construction General Permit (“CGP”) will be obtained by filing a Notice of Intent (“NOI”) with EPA Region 6. Coverage under the CGP is required prior to field work.  A copy of the SWPPP must be maintained at the project site during all construction activities.  New Mexico does not have primacy over the SWPPP requirements.  EPA Region 6 is the primary agency. 
 
AMEC prepared and submitted a revised New Mexico Mining and Minerals Subpart 4 Exploration permit application. The revised application was submitted on September 16, 2011 and MMD issued administrative completeness determination on October 4, 2012.  The Agency comment period closed on December 31, 2012.  MMD requested a site visit as part of the Agency review process, and the site visit was conducted on December 5, 2012. A second site visit was requested by MMD to view locations that were not accessible. Revisions to the boring locations were made, based on the field visit, and revised boring location figures were submitted to the MMD on April 26, 2013. To date a second site visit has not been conducted related to the drill hole sites.

A PoO was submitted to the USFS in 2011.  Comments were received from the USFS and incorporated into a revised document which was resubmitted to the USFS.  In addition, at the request of the USFS, a NEPA scope of work (“SOW”) was prepared and submitted to the USFS in 2012.  Comments were received from the USFS and incorporated into a revised NEPA SOW.  This activity has been on hold since April 2013.  In February through April 2013, the existing mine permit (L1005 ME) for the El Capitan Property mine site and a cursory review of water rights issues were evaluated. 
 
In May 2014, and in conjunction with requesting modifications to our mining permit, we submitted a revised PoO, as well as the required reclamation plan for the site. The modified permit approval process required we increase the amount of our reclamation bond to $74,495. We posted the increased bond in January 2015 and received the modified mining permit on March 25, 2015. 
 
In June 2014 we applied for an Air Quality Permit for our operation, which is tied to the generation of dust from the mining and crushing process. This permit was issued by the New Mexico Environment Department Air Quality Bureau in November 2014.
 
Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) under the Department of Labor cited the Company in March 2016 for violations. The Company contends that the work which was done and work that was being done was according to the handbook issued by MSHA. The Company has challenged the citations and has requested a hearing for Administrative relief.
Employees
 
We currently have informal arrangements with two individuals, one of whom is an officer and director of the Company and one is an officer of the Company, who serve as support staff for the functioning of all the corporate activities. There are no written agreements with these individuals. Additionally, we use consultants for the testing and exploration of property claims. If administrative requirements expand, we anticipate that we may hire additional employees, and utilize a combination of employees and consultants as necessary to conduct of these activities.
